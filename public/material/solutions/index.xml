      <description>In a previous post , we explained our equation for everything as:
In this post we explain its active form as:
This is made up of two parts, separated by a colon or ratio sign*;
 The Kepler Tensor G (s)  which has:  The gravitational signature G The limiter (s)  . This is inferred from the type and time of the Cartesian view   The Cartesian View: This is the plane, layer, and timespan where the motion takes place.</description>

      <title>How to Solve Global Warming</title>

      <description>The lashing of Hurricane Ida, the floods in China, and forest fires in Siberia and Europe has made the impact of global warming obvious to all. Unfortunately, policymakers seem to have no other solution to it other than:
 reducing CO2 emissions through a carbon tax, anti-emission regulations, or green energy building infrastracture as new dams, roads, and bridges that can withstand natural disasters better  However, despite lobbying by various parties and governments, such solutions still are not implemented due to their cost or impracticality.</description>

      <title>How Qosts Can Make Fusion a Reality</title>

      <description>The previous post explained the concept of Qosts or the quantum of space time . These are points in spacetime that gather energy to create mass in order to create discrete things. These create spacetime by their mutual repulsion and, thus, are essential in levitation and teleportation.
  These can also be employed to harness energy in two ways:
  By tapping into the repulsion of qosts that lead to the accelerated expansion of space.</description>

      <title>Light-based Computing</title>

      <description>Light, as analog waves, carry more data as &amp;ldquo;R-O-Y-G-B-I-V&amp;rdquo; than electrons that can only carry digital binary data as &amp;ldquo;ON-OFF&amp;rdquo; at a time. This analog light data can then be absorbed by glass or semiconductor crystals to be processed by normal computer logic.
This principle was recently proven to be realizable in Germany . In their experiment, intense light pulses of waves ranging from near-infrared to visible orange were used to generate oscillating currents in a chip made with gallium arsenide.</description>
