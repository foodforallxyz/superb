      <description>While collating the works of Socrates in order to unify them with those of David Hume to harmonize Superphysics, I came upon his maxims on astrophysics: The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge. Any geometrician who saw them would never think that there is a true equal, true double, or true proportion in the spangled heavens. Likewise, a true astronomer..will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, the stars to one another are eternal and subject to no deviation.</description>
