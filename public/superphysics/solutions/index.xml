      <description>The advent of the internet allowed information to be shared globally, resulting in &amp;lsquo;information overload&amp;rsquo;. However, this increase in the quantity of information being perceived did not really come from new information, but instead came from already-existing information from various sources being made accessible to the user or perceiver.
Assuming that there are 100 million people in a country, and a person creates his own information and interacts with 100 people in a day, then he can perceive up to 100 units of information.</description>

      <description>Superphysics is based on waves which need linear algebra to notate and compute. Moverover, no wave exists alone - all waves and even parts of the same wave are analogous or relative to another. This is different from particles which are discrete and can exist all alone.
Particle-based Math An example of a &amp;lsquo;particle-based&amp;rsquo; equation is Newton&amp;rsquo;s second law:
F = ma An example of a &amp;lsquo;wave-based&amp;rsquo; equation is that of Maxwell:</description>

      <description>A lot of people confuse socialism, left wing, democracy, and communism with each other. This is because ideas from one generation are commonly usurped by later generations according to their different experiences, rather than creating new names for new ideas arising from those new experiences.
A modern day example is the mobile phone and smartphone. A mobile phone means mobile telephone. When computer-abilities were added to it, it became a ‘smartphone’.</description>

      <description>Pantrynomics (Economic Superphysics) aims to solve all economic problems by adding moneyless donations and exchange (barter), as points-based valuation, to the current money-based valuation. This is similar to how Material Superphysics aims to solve mysteries in Physics by adding the aether-idea onto the idea of &amp;ldquo;quantum fields&amp;rdquo;.
The points-based valuation represents the effort theory of value which we derived from Adam Smith:
Labour..is the only universal, as well as the only accurate measure of value.</description>
