      <description>The ruler must use the services of men, such as soldiers, policemen, and secretaries., in all the departments of political power (imarah).
For each department, he will be satisfied with men who, he knows, are adequate, and he will provide for their sustenance from the treasury. All this belongs to political power and the living made out of it. The authority of political administration extends to all these men, and the highest royal authority is the (common) source of (power for) their various branches.</description>
