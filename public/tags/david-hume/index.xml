      <description>The previous post explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings, just as a novelist writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind.
The purpose of ideas is to create experience. However, experience can only exist if there is an experiencer. Thus, there are only two things in this &amp;lsquo;matrix&amp;rsquo; of Existence:
 the experiencer the experience of ideas and feelings  The Positive and Negative Forces Before existence began, the Absolute Creator had nothing to create those experiencer and experiences.</description>

      <title>David Hume&#39;s Idea of the Self</title>

      <description>In Book 1 of A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume laid out his principle of the self.
According to him, &amp;lsquo;identity&amp;rsquo; is a perception of something that is separate from another perception. For example, the identity of a car&amp;rsquo;s tire is a separate identity from the car because our minds can perceive them as separately existing.
If our minds cannot separate them, then their identity is one. An example is the balloon of a hot air balloon which cannot be separated without destroying its vehicle&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description>
