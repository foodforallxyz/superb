      <description>Profit is the value realized from human labor.
Man, by nature, needs something to feed him and to provide for him in all the conditions and stages of his life from the time of his (early) growth to his maturity and on to his old age.

The idea is that &amp;lsquo;aysh &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo; is obtained only through the things that go into making a living, and they are therefore considered, with some exaggeration, &amp;ldquo;the place of life.&amp;rdquo; 14
Sustenance and profit may be obtained - through- having the power to take them away from others and to appropriate them according to a generally recognized norm.</description>
