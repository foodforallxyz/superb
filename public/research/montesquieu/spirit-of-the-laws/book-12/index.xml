      <description>Relative to the constitution, political liberty arises from a distribution of the three powers.
Relative to the citizen, political liberty is in security.
 The constitution might be free, but the subject not. The citizen might be free, but not the constitution.  When the constitution is free by right and not in fact, the citizen will be free in fact, and not by right.
It is the disposition only of the laws, and even of the fundamental laws, that constitutes liberty in relation to t he constitution.</description>

      <description>LIBERTY is perfected when:
 criminal laws derive each punishment from the nature of the crime. there are then no arbitrary decisions the punishment does not flow from the capriciousness of the legislator, but from the very nature of the thing man uses no violence to man  There are four sorts of crimes:
 Religious crimes Moral crimes Crimes against the public peace Crimes against the citizen&amp;rsquo;s security  The punishments inflicted for these crimes should come from the nature of each of these species.</description>

      <title>The Crime against Nature</title>

      <description>GOD forbid that I should have the least inclination to diminish the public horror against a crime which religion, m orality, and civil government, equally condemn.
It ought to be proscribed w ere it only for its communicating to one sex the weaknesses of the other, a nd for leading people, by a scandalous prostitution of their youth, to an i gnominious old age. What I shall say concerning it will no ways diminish it s infamy, being levelled only against the tyranny that may abuse the very h orror we ought to have against the vice.</description>

      <description>MARSYAS dreamt that he had cut Dionysius&amp;rsquo;s throat. Dionysius put him to death, pretending that he would never have dreamt of such a thing by night if he had not thought o f it by day. This was a most tyrannical action; for, though it had been t he subject of his thoughts, yet he had made no attempt towards it. The laws do not take upon them to punish any other than overt acts.</description>

      <title>How dangerous it is, in Republ= ics, to be too severe in punishing the Crime of High-Treason</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/montesquieu/spirit-of-the-laws/book-12/chapter-18/</link>

      <description>AS soon as a republic has compassed the = destruction of those who wanted to subvert it, there should be an end of te= rrors, punishments, and even of rewards.
Great punishments, and consequently grea= t changes, cannot take place without investing some citizens with an exorbi= tant power. It is therefore more adviseable, in this case, to exceed in len= ity, than in severity; to banish but few, rather than many; and to leave th= em their estates, instead of making a vast number of confiscations.</description>

      <title>Things that strike at Liberty in Monarchies</title>

      <description>LIBERTY often has been weakened in monar chies by a thing of the least use in the world to the prince. This is the naming of commissioners to try a private person.
The prince himself derives so very littl e advantage from those commissioners, that it is not worth while to change, for their sake, the common course of things. He is morally sure that he ha s more of the spirit of probity and justice than his commissioners, who thi nk themselves sufficiently justified by his nomination and orders, by a vag ue interest of state, and even by their very apprehensions.</description>

      <title>The Manner of governing in Monarchies</title>

      <description>THE royal authority is a spring that should move with the greatest freedom and ease.
The Chinese boast of one of their emperors, who governed like the heavens; that is, by his example.
There are some cases in which a sovereign should exert the full extent of his power, and others in which he should reduce it within narrower limits. The sublimity of administration consist s in knowing the proper degree of power which should be exerted on differen t occasions.</description>
