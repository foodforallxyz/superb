      <description>A monarchical or despotic government does not need virtue. The force of laws and the prince’s arm are enough to maintain it.
But in a popular state, virtue is necessary for its leaders. A monarch can fix his mistakes by himself. But if a democratic leader suspends the laws of a corrupted state, then that state is certainly undone.
The English couldn&amp;rsquo;t establish democracy in the last century because their leaders did not have virtue.</description>

      <description>Chapter 5= Virtue is not the Principle of a monarchical Government Monarchies, policy effects great things with as little virtue as possible.
Thus, in the nicest machines, art has reduced the number of movements, springs, and wheels.state subsists independently of the love of our country, of the thirst of true glory, of self-denial, of the sacrifice of our dearest interests, and of all those heroic virtues which we admire in the ancients, and to us are known only by story.</description>

      <description>Honour is not the Principle of a despotic Government.
In a despotism, mankind is all equal. No one person can prefer himself to another
Yet, they are all slaves, they can give themselves no sort of preference., as honour has its laws and rules; as it knows not how to submit; as it depends, in a great measure, on a man’s own caprice, and not on that of another person;</description>
