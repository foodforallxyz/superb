      <description>OFFENSIVE force is regulated by the law of nations which is the political law of each country relative to other countries.
Chapter 2: War THE life of governments is like that of man.
I have a right to kill for natural defence because my life is, in respect to me, what the life of my an tagonist is to him.
A government has a right to wage war for its own preservation.</description>

      <title>Conquests made by a Republic</title>

      <description>IT is unnatural for a confederate government to have one state conquer another, as what happened in Switzerland in our days.
But this is not so absurd in mixed confederate republics, where small republics are associated with small monarchies.
It is also unnatural for a democratic republic to conquer towns which cannot enter into the sphere of its democracy.
It is necessary that the conquered people s hould be capable of enjoying the privileges of sovereignty, as was settled in the very beginning among the Romans.</description>

      <title>Conquests made by a Monarchy</title>

      <description>IF a monarchy can survive before it is weakened by its increase, it will become formidable. Its strength will remain entire while pent up by the neighbouring monarchies.
Thus, a monarchy should not conquer beyond the natural limits of its government. In this kind of conquest things must be left as they were found; the same courts of judicature, the same laws, the same customs, the same privileges= there ought to be no other alteration th an that of the army and of the name of the sovereign.</description>

      <description>Alexander started his expedition after he had secured Macedonia against the neighbouring barbarians and completed the reduction of Greece.
He:
 rendered the jealousy of the Spartans of no effect attacked the maritime provinces caused his land forces to keep close to the sea coast, that they might not be separated from his fleet made an admirable use of discipline against numbers never lacked provisions because victory gave him everything  In the beginning, he trusted very little to chance.</description>

      <description>The Mongols, who now govern China, has ordained that every military corps in the provinces, as well as the courts of judicature, should be composed half of Chinese and half Mongols. Their goal is to:
 end the jealousy between the Chinese and Mongols prevent the Chinese, the vanquished nation, from falling into despair prevent the Mongols, the victors, from growing insolent and proud the government from becoming military contain the two nations within their duty  This is an amirable policy for monarch that has subdued a large country.</description>
