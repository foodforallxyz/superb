      <description>A religion that is successfully adopted in a state is one that matches the plan of its government. This is because those who will follow it only know the current form for government.
Two centuries ago, Christianity became divided into Catholic and Protestant.
 The North embraced the Protestant because of their spirit of liberty and independence The south adhered still to the Catholic because the people were not independent  In the countries themselves where the Protestant religion became established, the revolutions were made pursuant to the several plans of political government.</description>

      <description>ON the other hand, religion may support a state, when the laws themselves are incapable of doing it.
Thus, when a kingdom is frequently agitated by civil wars, religion may do much, by obliging one part of the state to remain always quiet. Among the Greeks, the Eleans, as priests of Apollo, lived always in peace.
In Japan*, the city of Meaco enjoys a constant peace, as being a holy city= religion supports this regulation, and that empire which seems to be alone upon earth, and which neither has, nor will have, any dependence on foreigners, has always, in its own bosom, a trade which war cannot ruin.</description>

      <description>IT appears from a passage of the books of the pontiffs, quoted by Cicero*, that they had amongst the Romans unpardonable crimes.
it is on this that Zozymus founds the narration so proper to blacken the motives of Constantine’s conversion; and Julian, that bitter raillery on this conversion in his Cæsars.
The Pagan religion prohibited only some of the grosser crimes, and which stopped the hand, but meddled not with the heart, might have crimes that were inexpiable=</description>

      <description>AS amidst several degrees of darkness we may form a judgment of those which are the least thick, and among precipices, which are the least deep; so we may search among false religions for those that are most conformable to the welfare of society; for those which, though they have not the effect of leading men to the felicity of another life, may contribute most to their happiness in this.</description>

      <description>WHEN religion appoints a cessation from labour, it ought to have a greater regard to the necessities of mankind, than to the grandeur of the being it designs to honour.
Athens* was subject to great inconveniencies from the excessive number of its festivals. These powerful people, to whose decision all the cities of Greece came to submit their quarrels, could not have time to dispatch such a multiplicity of affairs.</description>

      <title>The Laws of Perfection in Religion</title>

      <description>HUMAN laws are made to direct the will. These should give precepts, not counsels.
Religion is made to influence the heart. It should give many counsels and few precepts. It gives rules:
 not for what is good, but for what is better not to direct to what is right, but to what is perfect  Religious teachings should be counsels, and not laws, for perfection can have no relation to the universality of men or things.</description>
