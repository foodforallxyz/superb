                        <p>PART IV. NATURE.</p>
<p>The Rôle of Experiment and Generalisation.—Exper-
iment is the sole source of truth. It alone can teach us
something new; it alone can give us certainty. These
are two points that cannot be questioned. But then, if
experiment is everything, what place is left for mathe-
matical physics? What can experimental physics do with
such an auxiliary—an auxiliary, moreover, which seems
useless, and even may be dangerous?
However, mathematical physics exists. It has ren-
dered undeniable service, and that is a fact which has to
be explained. It is not sufficient merely to observe; we
must use our observations, and for that purpose we must
generalise. This is what has always been done, only as
the recollection of past errors has made man more and
more circumspect, he has observed more and more and
generalised less and less. Every age has scoffed at its
predecessor, accusing it of having generalised too boldly
and too naïvely. Descartes used to commiserate the Ioni-hypotheses in physics.

ans. Descartes in his turn makes us smile, and no doubt
some day our children will laugh at us. Is there no way
of getting at once to the gist of the matter, and thereby
escaping the raillery which we foresee? Cannot we be
content with experiment alone? No, that is impossible;
that would be a complete misunderstanding of the true
character of science. The man of science must work with
method. Science is built up of facts, as a house is built of
stones; but an accumulation of facts is no more a science
than a heap of stones is a house. Most important of all,
the man of science must exhibit foresight. Carlyle has
written somewhere something after this fashion. “Noth-
ing but facts are of importance. John Lackland passed
by here. Here is something that is admirable. Here is
a reality for which I would give all the theories in the
world.” 1 Carlyle was a compatriot of Bacon, and, like
him, he wished to proclaim his worship of the God of
Things as they are.
But Bacon would not have said that. That is the lan-
guage of the historian. The physicist would most likely
have said: “John Lackland passed by here. It is all the
same to me, for he will not pass this way again.”
We all know that there are good and bad experiments.

The latter accumulate in vain. Whether there are a hun-
dred or a thousand, one single piece of work by a real
master—by a Pasteur, for example—will be sufficient to
sweep them into oblivion. Bacon would have thoroughly
understood that, for he invented the phrase experimen-
tum crucis; but Carlyle would not have understood it. A
fact is a fact. A student has read such and such a num-
ber on his thermometer. He has taken no precautions.
It does not matter; he has read it, and if it is only the
fact which counts, this is a reality that is as much enti-
tled to be called a reality as the peregrinations of King
John Lackland. What, then, is a good experiment? It
is that which teaches us something more than an iso-
lated fact. It is that which enables us to predict, and to
generalise. Without generalisation, prediction is impos-
sible. The circumstances under which one has operated
will never again be reproduced simultaneously. The fact
observed will never be repeated. All that can be affirmed
is that under analogous circumstances an analogous fact
will be produced. To predict it, we must therefore invoke
the aid of analogy—that is to say, even at this stage, we
must generalise. However timid we may be, there must be
interpolation. Experiment only gives us a certain number
of isolated points. They must be connected by a contin-hypotheses in physics.

uous line, and this is a true generalisation. But more is
done. The curve thus traced will pass between and near
the points observed; it will not pass through the points
themselves. Thus we are not restricted to generalising our
experiment, we correct it; and the physicist who would
abstain from these corrections, and really content himself
with experiment pure and simple, would be compelled to
enunciate very extraordinary laws indeed. Detached facts
cannot therefore satisfy us, and that is why our science
must be ordered, or, better still, generalised.
It is often said that experiments should be made with-
out preconceived ideas. That is impossible. Not only
would it make every experiment fruitless, but even if we
wished to do so, it could not be done. Every man has his
own conception of the world, and this he cannot so eas-
ily lay aside. We must, for example, use language, and
our language is necessarily steeped in preconceived ideas.
Only they are unconscious preconceived ideas, which are
a thousand times the most dangerous of all. Shall we
say, that if we cause others to intervene of which we are
fully conscious, that we shall only aggravate the evil? I
do not think so. I am inclined to think that they will
serve as ample counterpoises—I was almost going to say
antidotes. They will generally disagree, they will enterscience and hypothesis
160
into conflict one with another, and ipso facto, they will
force us to look at things under different aspects. This is
enough to free us. He is no longer a slave who can choose
his master.
Thus, by generalisation, every fact observed enables
us to predict a large number of others; only, we ought not
to forget that the first alone is certain, and that all the
others are merely probable. However solidly founded a
prediction may appear to us, we are never absolutely sure
that experiment will not prove it to be baseless if we set
to work to verify it. But the probability of its accuracy is
often so great that practically we may be content with it.
It is far better to predict without certainty, than never
to have predicted at all. We should never, therefore, dis-
dain to verify when the opportunity presents itself. But
every experiment is long and difficult, and the labourers
are few, and the number of facts which we require to pre-
dict is enormous; and besides this mass, the number of
direct verifications that we can make will never be more
than a negligible quantity. Of this little that we can di-
rectly attain we must choose the best. Every experiment
must enable us to make a maximum number of predic-
tions having the highest possible degree of probability.
The problem is, so to speak, to increase the output ofhypotheses in physics.

the scientific machine. I may be permitted to compare
science to a library which must go on increasing indefi-
nitely; the librarian has limited funds for his purchases,
and he must, therefore, strain every nerve not to waste
them. Experimental physics has to make the purchases,
and experimental physics alone can enrich the library. As
for mathematical physics, her duty is to draw up the cat-
alogue. If the catalogue is well done the library is none
the richer for it; but the reader will be enabled to utilise
its riches; and also by showing the librarian the gaps in
his collection, it will help him to make a judicious use of
his funds, which is all the more important, inasmuch as
those funds are entirely inadequate. That is the rôle of
mathematical physics. It must direct generalisation, so
as to increase what I called just now the output of sci-
ence. By what means it does this, and how it may do it
without danger, is what we have now to examine.
The Unity of Nature.—Let us first of all observe that
every generalisation supposes in a certain measure a be-
lief in the unity and simplicity of Nature. As far as the
unity is concerned, there can be no difficulty. If the dif-
ferent parts of the universe were not as the organs of the
same body, they would not react one upon the other; they
would mutually ignore each other, and we in particularscience and hypothesis
162
should only know one part. We need not, therefore, ask
if Nature is one, but how she is one.
As for the second point, that is not so clear. It is not
certain that Nature is simple. Can we without danger
act as if she were?
There was a time when the simplicity of Mariotte’s
law was an argument in favour of its accuracy: when
Fresnel himself, after having said in a conversation with
Laplace that Nature cares naught for analytical difficul-
ties, was compelled to explain his words so as not to
give offence to current opinion. Nowadays, ideas have
changed considerably; but those who do not believe that
natural laws must be simple, are still often obliged to act
as if they did believe it. They cannot entirely dispense
with this necessity without making all generalisation, and
therefore all science, impossible. It is clear that any fact
can be generalised in an infinite number of ways, and it
is a question of choice. The choice can only be guided
by considerations of simplicity. Let us take the most
ordinary case, that of interpolation. We draw a con-
tinuous line as regularly as possible between the points
given by observation. Why do we avoid angular points
and inflexions that are too sharp? Why do we not make
our curve describe the most capricious zigzags? It is be-hypotheses in physics.
163
cause we know beforehand, or think we know, that the
law we have to express cannot be so complicated as all
that. The mass of Jupiter may be deduced either from
the movements of his satellites, or from the perturbations
of the major planets, or from those of the minor planets.
If we take the mean of the determinations obtained by
these three methods, we find three numbers very close
together, but not quite identical. This result might be
interpreted by supposing that the gravitation constant is
not the same in the three cases; the observations would
be certainly much better represented. Why do we reject
this interpretation? Not because it is absurd, but be-
cause it is uselessly complicated. We shall only accept it
when we are forced to, and it is not imposed upon us yet.
To sum up, in most cases every law is held to be simple
until the contrary is proved.
This custom is imposed upon physicists by the rea-
sons that I have indicated, but how can it be justified
in the presence of discoveries which daily show us fresh
details, richer and more complex? How can we even rec-
oncile it with the unity of nature? For if all things are
interdependent, the relations in which so many different
objects intervene can no longer be simple.
If we study the history of science we see produced twoscience and hypothesis
164
phenomena which are, so to speak, each the inverse of the
other. Sometimes it is simplicity which is hidden under
what is apparently complex; sometimes, on the contrary,
it is simplicity which is apparent, and which conceals
extremely complex realities. What is there more com-
plicated than the disturbed motions of the planets, and
what more simple than Newton’s law? There, as Fresnel
said, Nature playing with analytical difficulties, only uses
simple means, and creates by their combination I know
not what tangled skein. Here it is the hidden simplic-
ity which must be disentangled. Examples to the con-
trary abound. In the kinetic theory of gases, molecules
of tremendous velocity are discussed, whose paths, de-
formed by incessant impacts, have the most capricious
shapes, and plough their way through space in every di-
rection. The result observable is Mariotte’s simple law.
Each individual fact was complicated. The law of great
numbers has re-established simplicity in the mean. Here
the simplicity is only apparent, and the coarseness of our
senses alone prevents us from seeing the complexity.
Many phenomena obey a law of proportionality. But
why? Because in these phenomena there is something
which is very small. The simple law observed is only the
translation of the general analytical rule by which the in-hypotheses in physics.
165
finitely small increment of a function is proportional to
the increment of the variable. As in reality our incre-
ments are not infinitely small, but only very small, the
law of proportionality is only approximate, and simplic-
ity is only apparent. What I have just said applies to the
law of the superposition of small movements, which is so
fruitful in its applications and which is the foundation of
optics.
And Newton’s law itself? Its simplicity, so long un-
detected, is perhaps only apparent. Who knows if it be
not due to some complicated mechanism, to the impact
of some subtle matter animated by irregular movements,
and if it has not become simple merely through the play
of averages and large numbers? In any case, it is difficult
not to suppose that the true law contains complementary
terms which may become sensible at small distances. If
in astronomy they are negligible, and if the law thus re-
gains its simplicity, it is solely on account of the enor-
mous distances of the celestial bodies. No doubt, if our
means of investigation became more and more penetrat-
ing, we should discover the simple beneath the complex,
and then the complex from the simple, and then again
the simple beneath the complex, and so on, without ever
being able to predict what the last term will be. We mustscience and hypothesis
166
stop somewhere, and for science to be possible we must
stop where we have found simplicity. That is the only
ground on which we can erect the edifice of our gener-
alisations. But, this simplicity being only apparent, will
the ground be solid enough? That is what we have now
to discover.
For this purpose let us see what part is played in our
generalisations by the belief in simplicity. We have veri-
fied a simple law in a considerable number of particular
cases. We refuse to admit that this coincidence, so of-
ten repeated, is a result of mere chance, and we conclude
that the law must be true in the general case.
Kepler remarks that the positions of a planet observed
by Tycho are all on the same ellipse. Not for one moment
does he think that, by a singular freak of chance, Tycho
had never looked at the heavens except at the very mo-
ment when the path of the planet happened to cut that
ellipse. What does it matter then if the simplicity be
real or if it hide a complex truth? Whether it be due to
the influence of great numbers which reduces individual
differences to a level, or to the greatness or the smallness
of certain quantities which allow of certain terms to be
neglected—in no case is it due to chance. This simplicity,
real or apparent, has always a cause. We shall thereforehypotheses in physics.
167
always be able to reason in the same fashion, and if a
simple law has been observed in several particular cases,
we may legitimately suppose that it still will be true in
analogous cases. To refuse to admit this would be to at-
tribute an inadmissible rôle to chance. However, there
is a difference. If the simplicity were real and profound
it would bear the test of the increasing precision of our
methods of measurement. If, then, we believe Nature to
be profoundly simple, we must conclude that it is an ap-
proximate and not a rigorous simplicity. This is what
was formerly done, but it is what we have no longer the
right to do. The simplicity of Kepler’s laws, for instance,
is only apparent; but that does not prevent them from
being applied to almost all systems analogous to the solar
system, though that prevents them from being rigorously
exact.
Rôle of Hypothesis.—Every generalisation is a hy-
pothesis. Hypothesis therefore plays a necessary rôle,
which no one has ever contested. Only, it should al-
ways be as soon as possible submitted to verification.
It goes without saying that, if it cannot stand this test,
it must be abandoned without any hesitation. This is,
indeed, what is generally done; but sometimes with a
certain impatience. Ah well! this impatience is not jus-science and hypothesis
168
tified. The physicist who has just given up one of his
hypotheses should, on the contrary, rejoice, for he found
an unexpected opportunity of discovery. His hypothesis,
I imagine, had not been lightly adopted, It took into
account all the known factors which seem capable of
intervention in the phenomenon. If it is not verified,
it is because there is something unexpected and extra-
ordinary about it, because we are on the point of finding
something unknown and new. Has the hypothesis thus
rejected been sterile? Far from it. It may be even said
that it has rendered more service than a true hypothesis.
Not only has it been the occasion of a decisive experi-
ment, but if this experiment had been made by chance,
without the hypothesis, no conclusion could have been
drawn; nothing extraordinary would have been seen;
and only one fact the more would have been catalogued,
without deducing from it the remotest consequence.
Now, under what conditions is the use of hypothesis
without danger? The proposal to submit all to experi-
ment is not sufficient. Some hypotheses are dangerous,—
first and foremost those which are tacit and unconscious.
And since we make them without knowing them, we can-
not get rid of them. Here again, there is a service that
mathematical physics may render us. By the precisionhypotheses in physics.
169
which is its characteristic, we are compelled to formulate
all the hypotheses that we would unhesitatingly make
without its aid. Let us also notice that it is important not
to multiply hypotheses indefinitely. If we construct a the-
ory based upon multiple hypotheses, and if experiment
condemns it, which of the premisses must be changed? It
is impossible to tell. Conversely, if the experiment suc-
ceeds, must we suppose that it has verified all these hy-
potheses at once? Can several unknowns be determined
from a single equation?
We must also take care to distinguish between the
different kinds of hypotheses. First of all, there are those
which are quite natural and necessary. It is difficult not
to suppose that the influence of very distant bodies is
quite negligible, that small movements obey a linear law,
and that effect is a continuous function of its cause. I will
say as much for the conditions imposed by symmetry. All
these hypotheses affirm, so to speak, the common basis
of all the theories of mathematical physics. They are the
last that should be abandoned. There is a second cat-
egory of hypotheses which I shall qualify as indifferent.
In most questions the analyst assumes, at the beginning
of his calculations, either that matter is continuous, or
the reverse, that it is formed of atoms. In either case,science and hypothesis
170
his results would have been the same. On the atomic
supposition he has a little more difficulty in obtaining
them—that is all. If, then, experiment confirms his con-
clusions, will he suppose that he has proved, for example,
the real existence of atoms?
In optical theories two vectors are introduced, one of
which we consider as a velocity and the other as a vortex.
This again is an indifferent hypothesis, since we should
have arrived at the same conclusions by assuming the
former to be a vortex and the latter to be a velocity.
The success of the experiment cannot prove, therefore,
that the first vector is really a velocity. It only proves
one thing—namely, that it is a vector; and that is the
only hypothesis that has really been introduced into the
premisses. To give it the concrete appearance that the
fallibility of our minds demands, it was necessary to con-
sider it either as a velocity or as a vortex. In the same
way, it was necessary to represent it by an x or a y, but
the result will not prove that we were right or wrong in
regarding it as a velocity; nor will it prove we are right
or wrong in calling it x and not y.
These indifferent hypotheses are never dangerous pro-
vided their characters are not misunderstood. They may
be useful, either as artifices for calculation, or to assisthypotheses in physics.
171
our understanding by concrete images, to fix the ideas,
as we say. They need not therefore be rejected. The
hypotheses of the third category are real generalisations.
They must be confirmed or invalidated by experiment.
Whether verified or condemned, they will always be fruit-
ful; but, for the reasons I have given, they will only be
so if they are not too numerous.
Origin of Mathematical Physics.—Let us go further
and study more closely the conditions which have assisted
the development of mathematical physics. We recognise
at the outset that the efforts of men of science have always
tended to resolve the complex phenomenon given directly
by experiment into a very large number of elementary
phenomena, and that in three different ways.
First, with respect to time. Instead of embracing in its
entirety the progressive development of a phenomenon,
we simply try to connect each moment with the one im-
mediately preceding. We admit that the present state of
the world only depends on the immediate past, without
being directly influenced, so to speak, by the recollection
of a more distant past. Thanks to this postulate, instead
of studying directly the whole succession of phenomena,
we may confine ourselves to writing down its differential
equation; for the laws of Kepler we substitute the law ofscience and hypothesis
172
Newton.
Next, we try to decompose the phenomena in space.
What experiment gives us is a confused aggregate of facts
spread over a scene of considerable extent. We must try
to deduce the elementary phenomenon, which will still
be localised in a very small region of space.
A few examples perhaps will make my meaning
clearer. If we wished to study in all its complexity the
distribution of temperature in a cooling solid, we could
never do so. This is simply because, if we only reflect
that a point in the solid can directly impart some of
its heat to a neighbouring point, it will immediately
impart that heat only to the nearest points, and it is
but gradually that the flow of heat will reach other por-
tions of the solid. The elementary phenomenon is the
interchange of heat between two contiguous points. It is
strictly localised and relatively simple if, as is natural,
we admit that it is not influenced by the temperature of
the molecules whose distance apart is small.
I bend a rod: it takes a very complicated form, the
direct investigation of which would be impossible. But
I can attack the problem, however, if I notice that its
flexure is only the resultant of the deformations of the
very small elements of the rod, and that the deformationhypotheses in physics.
173
of each of these elements only depends on the forces which
are directly applied to it, and not in the least on those
which may be acting on the other elements.
In all these examples, which may be increased with-
out difficulty, it is admitted that there is no action at a
distance or at great distances. That is an hypothesis. It
is not always true, as the law of gravitation proves. It
must therefore be verified. If it is confirmed, even approx-
imately, it is valuable, for it helps us to use mathematical
physics, at any rate by successive approximations. If it
does not stand the test, we must seek something else that
is analogous, for there are other means of arriving at the
elementary phenomenon. If several bodies act simultane-
ously, it may happen that their actions are independent,
and may be added one to the other, either as vectors
or as scalar quantities. The elementary phenomenon is
then the action of an isolated body. Or suppose, again,
it is a question of small movements, or more generally of
small variations which obey the well-known law of mu-
tual or relative independence. The movement observed
will then be decomposed into simple movements—for ex-
ample, sound into its harmonics, and white light into its
monochromatic components. When we have discovered
in which direction to seek for the elementary phenom-science and hypothesis
174
ena, by what means may we reach it? First, it will often
happen that in order to predict it, or rather in order
to predict what is useful to us, it will not be necessary
to know its mechanism. The law of great numbers will
suffice. Take for example the propagation of heat. Each
molecule radiates towards its neighbour—we need not in-
quire according to what law; and if we make any suppo-
sition in this respect, it will be an indifferent hypothesis,
and therefore useless and unverifiable. In fact, by the
action of averages and thanks to the symmetry of the
medium, all differences are levelled, and, whatever the
hypothesis may be, the result is always the same.
The same feature is presented in the theory of elastic-
ity, and in that of capillarity. The neighbouring molecules
attract and repel each other, we need not inquire by what
law. It is enough for us that this attraction is sensible
at small distances only, and that the molecules are very
numerous, that the medium is symmetrical, and we have
only to let the law of great numbers come into play.
Here again the simplicity of the elementary phe-
nomenon is hidden beneath the complexity of the ob-
servable resultant phenomenon; but in its turn this
simplicity was only apparent and disguised a very com-
plex mechanism. Evidently the best means of reachinghypotheses in physics.
175
the elementary phenomenon would be experiment. It
would be necessary by experimental artifices to disso-
ciate the complex system which nature offers for our
investigations and carefully to study the elements as
dissociated as possible; for example, natural white light
would be decomposed into monochromatic lights by the
aid of the prism, and into polarised lights by the aid of
the polariser. Unfortunately, that is neither always pos-
sible nor always sufficient, and sometimes the mind must
run ahead of experiment. I shall only give one example
which has always struck me rather forcibly. If I decom-
pose white light, I shall be able to isolate a portion of the
spectrum, but however small it may be, it will always
be a certain width. In the same way the natural lights
which are called monochromatic give us a very fine ray,
but one which is not, however, infinitely fine. It might be
supposed that in the experimental study of the properties
of these natural lights, by operating with finer and finer
rays, and passing on at last to the limit, so to speak, we
should eventually obtain the properties of a rigorously
monochromatic light. That would not be accurate. I
assume that two rays emanate from the same source,
that they are first polarised in planes at right angles,
that they are then brought back again to the same planescience and hypothesis
176
of polarisation, and that we try to obtain interference. If
the light were rigorously monochromatic, there would be
interference; but with our nearly monochromatic lights,
there will be no interference, and that, however narrow
the ray may be. For it to be otherwise, the ray would
have to be several million times finer than the finest
known rays.
Here then we should be led astray by proceeding to
the limit. The mind has to run ahead of the experiment,
and if it has done so with success, it is because it has al-
lowed itself to be guided by the instinct of simplicity. The
knowledge of the elementary fact enables us to state the
problem in the form of an equation. It only remains to
deduce from it by combination the observable and verifi-
able complex fact. That is what we call integration, and it
is the province of the mathematician. It might be asked,
why in physical science generalisation so readily takes
the mathematical form. The reason is now easy to see.
It is not only because we have to express numerical laws;
it is because the observable phenomenon is due to the
superposition of a large number of elementary phenom-
ena which are all similar to each other ; and in this way
differential equations are quite naturally introduced. It
is not enough that each elementary phenomenon shouldhypotheses in physics.
177
obey simple laws: all those that we have to combine must
obey the same law; then only is the intervention of math-
ematics of any use. Mathematics teaches us, in fact, to
combine like with like. Its object is to divine the result of
a combination without having to reconstruct that com-
bination element by element. If we have to repeat the
same operation several times, mathematics enables us to
avoid this repetition by telling the result beforehand by
a kind of induction. This I have explained before in the
chapter on mathematical reasoning. But for that pur-
pose all these operations must be similar; in the contrary
case we must evidently make up our minds to working
them out in full one after the other, and mathematics
will be useless. It is therefore, thanks to the approxi-
mate homogeneity of the matter studied by physicists,
that mathematical physics came into existence. In the
natural sciences the following conditions are no longer
to be found:—homogeneity, relative independence of re-
mote parts, simplicity of the elementary fact; and that is
why the student of natural science is compelled to have
recourse to other modes of generalisation.CHAPTER X.
THE THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS.
Significance of Physical Theories.—The ephemeral na-
ture of scientific theories takes by surprise the man of
the world. Their brief period of prosperity ended, he
sees them abandoned one after another; he sees ruins
piled upon ruins; he predicts that the theories in fashion
to-day will in a short time succumb in their turn, and he
concludes that they are absolutely in vain. This is what
he calls the bankruptcy of science.
His scepticism is superficial; he does not take into
account the object of scientific theories and the part they
play, or he would understand that the ruins may be still
good for something. No theory seemed established on
firmer ground than Fresnel’s, which attributed light to
the movements of the ether. Then if Maxwell’s theory
is to-day preferred, does that mean that Fresnel’s work
was in vain? No; for Fresnel’s object was not to know
whether there really is an ether, if it is or is not formed
of atoms, if these atoms really move in this way or that;
his object was to predict optical phenomena.
This Fresnel’s theory enables us to do to-day as well
as it did before Maxwell’s time. The differential equa-the theories of modern physics.
179
tions are always true, they may be always integrated
by the same methods, and the results of this integra-
tion still preserve their value. It cannot be said that this
is reducing physical theories to simple practical recipes;
these equations express relations, and if the equations
remain true, it is because the relations preserve their re-
ality. They teach us now, as they did then, that there
is such and such a relation between this thing and that;
only, the something which we then called motion, we now
call electric current. But these are merely names of the
images we substituted for the real objects which Nature
will hide for ever from our eyes. The true relations be-
tween these real objects are the only reality we can attain,
and the sole condition is that the same relations shall ex-
ist between these objects as between the images we are
forced to put in their place. If the relations are known
to us, what does it matter if we think it convenient to
replace one image by another?
That a given periodic phenomenon (an electric oscil-
lation, for instance) is really due to the vibration of a
given atom, which, behaving like a pendulum, is really
displaced in this manner or that, all this is neither certain
nor essential. But that there is between the electric oscil-
lation, the movement of the pendulum, and all periodicscience and hypothesis
180
phenomena an intimate relationship which corresponds
to a profound reality; that this relationship, this similar-
ity, or rather this parallelism, is continued in the details;
that it is a consequence of more general principles such
as that of the conservation of energy, and that of least
action; this we may affirm; this is the truth which will
ever remain the same in whatever garb we may see fit to
clothe it.
Many theories of dispersion have been proposed. The
first were imperfect, and contained but little truth. Then
came that of Helmholtz, and this in its turn was modified
in different ways; its author himself conceived another
theory, founded on Maxwell’s principles. But the re-
markable thing is, that all the scientists who followed
Helmholtz obtain the same equations, although their
starting-points were to all appearance widely separated.
I venture to say that these theories are all simultaneously
true; not merely because they express a true relation—
that between absorption and abnormal dispersion. In
the premisses of these theories the part that is true is
the part common to all: it is the affirmation of this or
that relation between certain things, which some call by
one name and some by another.
The kinetic theory of gases has given rise to many ob-the theories of modern physics.
181
jections, to which it would be difficult to find an answer
were it claimed that the theory is absolutely true. But all
these objections do not alter the fact that it has been use-
ful, particularly in revealing to us one true relation which
would otherwise have remained profoundly hidden—the
relation between gaseous and osmotic pressures. In this
sense, then, it may be said to be true.
When a physicist finds a contradiction between two
theories which are equally dear to him, he sometimes
says: “Let us not be troubled, but let us hold fast to the
two ends of the chain, lest we lose the intermediate links.”
This argument of the embarrassed theologian would be
ridiculous if we were to attribute to physical theories the
interpretation given them by the man of the world. In
case of contradiction one of them at least should be con-
sidered false. But this is no longer the case if we only
seek in them what should be sought. It is quite possi-
ble that they both express true relations, and that the
contradictions only exist in the images we have formed
to ourselves of reality. To those who feel that we are go-
ing too far in our limitations of the domain accessible to
the scientist, I reply: These questions which we forbid
you to investigate, and which you so regret, are not only
insoluble, they are illusory and devoid of meaning.science and hypothesis
182
Such a philosopher claims that all physics can be ex-
plained by the mutual impact of atoms. If he simply
means that the same relations obtain between physical
phenomena as between the mutual impact of a large num-
ber of billiard balls—well and good! this is verifiable,
and perhaps is true. But he means something more, and
we think we understand him, because we think we know
what an impact is. Why? Simply because we have of-
ten watched a game of billiards. Are we to understand
that God experiences the same sensations in the contem-
plation of His work that we do in watching a game of
billiards? If it is not our intention to give his assertion
this fantastic meaning, and if we do not wish to give it the
more restricted meaning I have already mentioned, which
is the sound meaning, then it has no meaning at all. Hy-
potheses of this kind have therefore only a metaphorical
sense. The scientist should no more banish them than
a poet banishes metaphor; but he ought to know what
they are worth. They may be useful to give satisfaction
to the mind, and they will do no harm as long as they
are only indifferent hypotheses.
These considerations explain to us why certain theo-
ries, that were thought to be abandoned and definitively
condemned by experiment, are suddenly revived fromthe theories of modern physics.
183
their ashes and begin a new life. It is because they ex-
pressed true relations, and had not ceased to do so when
for some reason or other we felt it necessary to enunciate
the same relations in another language. Their life had
been latent, as it were.
Barely fifteen years ago, was there anything more
ridiculous, more quaintly old-fashioned, than the fluids
of Coulomb? And yet, here they are re-appearing un-
der the name of electrons. In what do these permanently
electrified molecules differ from the electric molecules of
Coulomb? It is true that in the electrons the electricity is
supported by a little, a very little matter; in other words,
they have mass. Yet Coulomb did not deny mass to his
fluids, or if he did, it was with reluctance. It would be
rash to affirm that the belief in electrons will not also
undergo an eclipse, but it was none the less curious to
note this unexpected renaissance.
But the most striking example is Carnot’s principle.
Carnot established it, starting from false hypotheses.
When it was found that heat was indestructible, and
may be converted into work, his ideas were completely
abandoned; later, Clausius returned to them, and to him
is due their definitive triumph. In its primitive form,
Carnot’s theory expressed in addition to true relations,science and hypothesis
184
other inexact relations, the débris of old ideas; but the
presence of the latter did not alter the reality of the
others. Clausius had only to separate them, just as one
lops off dead branches.
The result was the second fundamental law of thermo-
dynamics. The relations were always the same, although
they did not hold, at least to all appearance, between the
same objects. This was sufficient for the principle to re-
tain its value. Nor have the reasonings of Carnot perished
on this account; they were applied to an imperfect con-
ception of matter, but their form—i.e., the essential part
of them, remained correct. What I have just said throws
some light at the same time on the rôle of general princi-
ples, such as those of the principle of least action or of the
conservation of energy. These principles are of very great
value. They were obtained in the search for what there
was in common in the enunciation of numerous physical
laws; they thus represent the quintessence of innumer-
able observations. However, from their very generality
results a consequence to which I have called attention in
Chapter VIII.—namely, that they are no longer capable
of verification. As we cannot give a general definition of
energy, the principle of the conservation of energy simply
signifies that there is a something which remains con-the theories of modern physics.
185
stant. Whatever fresh notions of the world may be given
us by future experiments, we are certain beforehand that
there is something which remains constant, and which
may be called energy. Does this mean that the princi-
ple has no meaning and vanishes into a tautology? Not
at all. It means that the different things to which we
give the name of energy are connected by a true relation-
ship; it affirms between them a real relation. But then,
if this principle has a meaning, it may be false; it may
be that we have no right to extend indefinitely its appli-
cations, and yet it is certain beforehand to be verified in
the strict sense of the word. How, then, shall we know
when it has been extended as far as is legitimate? Simply
when it ceases to be useful to us—i.e., when we can no
longer use it to predict correctly new phenomena. We
shall be certain in such a case that the relation affirmed
is no longer real, for otherwise it would be fruitful; ex-
periment without directly contradicting a new extension
of the principle will nevertheless have condemned it.
Physics and Mechanism.—Most theorists have a
constant predilection for explanations borrowed from
physics, mechanics, or dynamics. Some would be sat-
isfied if they could account for all phenomena by the
motion of molecules attracting one another accordingscience and hypothesis
186
to certain laws. Others are more exact: they would
suppress attractions acting at a distance; their molecules
would follow rectilinear paths, from which they would
only be deviated by impacts. Others again, such as
Hertz, suppress the forces as well, but suppose their
molecules subjected to geometrical connections analo-
gous, for instance, to those of articulated systems; thus,
they wish to reduce dynamics to a kind of kinematics. In
a word, they all wish to bend nature into a certain form,
and unless they can do this they cannot be satisfied. Is
Nature flexible enough for this?
We shall examine this question in Chapter XII., àpro-
pos of Maxwell’s theory. Every time that the principles of
least action and energy are satisfied, we shall see that not
only is there always a mechanical explanation possible,
but that there is an unlimited number of such explana-
tions. By means of a well-known theorem due to Königs,
it may be shown that we can explain everything in an un-
limited number of ways, by connections after the manner
of Hertz, or, again, by central forces. No doubt it may be
just as easily demonstrated that everything may be ex-
plained by simple impacts. For this, let us bear in mind
that it is not enough to be content with the ordinary mat-
ter of which we are aware by means of our senses, and thethe theories of modern physics.

movements of which we observe directly. We may con-
ceive of ordinary matter as either composed of atoms,
whose internal movements escape us, our senses being
able to estimate only the displacement of the whole; or
we may imagine one of those subtle fluids, which under
the name of ether or other names, have from all time
played so important a rôle in physical theories. Often we
go further, and regard the ether as the only primitive, or
even as the only true matter. The more moderate con-
sider ordinary matter to be condensed ether, and there is
nothing startling in this conception; but others only re-
duce its importance still further, and see in matter noth-
ing more than the geometrical locus of singularities in
the ether. Lord Kelvin, for instance, holds what we call
matter to be only the locus of those points at which the
ether is animated by vortex motions. Riemann believes
it to be locus of those points at which ether is constantly
destroyed; to Wiechert or Larmor, it is the locus of the
points at which the ether has undergone a kind of torsion
of a very particular kind. Taking any one of these points
of view, I ask by what right do we apply to the ether
the mechanical properties observed in ordinary matter,
which is but false matter? The ancient fluids, caloric,
electricity, etc., were abandoned when it was seen thatscience and hypothesis
188
heat is not indestructible. But they were also laid aside
for another reason, In materialising them, their individ-
uality was, so to speak, emphasised—gaps were opened
between them; and these gaps had to be filled in when
the sentiment of the unity of Nature became stronger,
and when the intimate relations which connect all the
parts were perceived. In multiplying the fluids, not only
did the ancient physicists create unnecessary entities, but
they destroyed real ties. It is not enough for a theory not
to affirm false relations; it must not conceal true rela-
tions.
Does our ether actually exist? We know the origin of
our belief in the ether. If light takes several years to reach
us from a distant star, it is no longer on the star, nor is
it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported,
so to speak, by some material agency.
The same idea may be expressed in a more mathe-
matical and more abstract form. What we note are the
changes undergone by the material molecules. We see,
for instance, that the photographic plate experiences the
consequences of a phenomenon of which the incandescent
mass of a star was the scene several years before. Now, in
ordinary mechanics, the state of the system under consid-
eration depends only on its state at the moment imme-the theories of modern physics.

diately preceding; the system therefore satisfies certain
differential equations. On the other hand, if we did not
believe in the ether, the state of the material universe
would depend not only on the state immediately preced-
ing, but also on much older states; the system would
satisfy equations of finite differences. The ether was in-
vented to escape this breaking down of the laws of general
mechanics.
Still, this would only compel us to fill the interplan-
etary space with ether, but not to make it penetrate
into the midst of the material media. Fizeau’s exper-
iment goes further. By the interference of rays which
have passed through the air or water in motion, it seems
to show us two different media penetrating each other,
and yet being displaced with respect to each other. The
ether is all but in our grasp. Experiments can be con-
ceived in which we come closer still to it. Assume that
Newton’s principle of the equality of action and reaction
is not true if applied to matter alone, and that this can
be proved. The geometrical sum of all the forces applied
to all the molecules would no longer be zero. If we did
not wish to change the whole of the science of mechan-
ics, we should have to introduce the ether, in order that
the action which matter apparently undergoes should bescience and hypothesis
190
counterbalanced by the reaction of matter on something.
Or again, suppose we discover that optical and electri-
cal phenomena are influenced by the motion of the earth.
It would follow that those phenomena might reveal to us
not only the relative motion of material bodies, but also
what would seem to be their absolute motion. Again, it
would be necessary to have an ether in order that these
so-called absolute movements should not be their dis-
placements with respect to empty space, but with respect
to something concrete.
Will this ever be accomplished? I do not think so,
and I shall explain why; and yet, it is not absurd, for
others have entertained this view. For instance, if the
theory of Lorentz, of which I shall speak in more detail
in Chapter XIII., were true, Newton’s principle would
not apply to matter alone, and the difference would not
be very far from being within reach of experiment. On
the other hand, many experiments have been made on
the influence of the motion of the earth. The results
have always been negative. But if these experiments have
been undertaken, it is because we have not been certain
beforehand; and indeed, according to current theories,
the compensation would be only approximate, and we
might expect to find accurate methods giving positivethe theories of modern physics.
191
results. I think that such a hope is illusory; it was none
the less interesting to show that a success of this kind
would, in a certain sense, open to us a new world.
And now allow me to make a digression; I must ex-
plain why I do not believe, in spite of Lorentz, that more
exact observations will ever make evident anything else
but the relative displacements of material bodies. Exper-
iments have been made that should have disclosed the
terms of the first order; the results were nugatory. Could
that have been by chance? No one has admitted this;
a general explanation was sought, and Lorentz found it.
He showed that the terms of the first order should can-
cel each other, but not the terms of the second order.
Then more exact experiments were made, which were
also negative; neither could this be the result of chance.
An explanation was necessary, and was forthcoming; they
always are; hypotheses are what we lack the least. But
this is not enough. Who is there who does not think that
this leaves to chance far too important a rôle? Would it
not also be a chance that this singular concurrence should
cause a certain circumstance to destroy the terms of the
first order, and that a totally different but very oppor-
tune circumstance should cause those of the second order
to vanish? No; the same explanation must be found forscience and hypothesis
192
the two cases, and everything tends to show that this ex-
planation would serve equally well for the terms of the
higher order, and that the mutual destruction of these
terms will be rigorous and absolute.
The Present State of Physics.—Two opposite tenden-
cies may be distinguished in the history of the develop-
ment of physics. On the one hand, new relations are con-
tinually being discovered between objects which seemed
destined to remain for ever unconnected; scattered facts
cease to be strangers to each other and tend to be mar-
shalled into an imposing synthesis. The march of science
is towards unity and simplicity.
On the other hand, new phenomena are continually
being revealed; it will be long before they can be assigned
their place—sometimes it may happen that to find them
a place a corner of the edifice must be demolished. In the
same way, we are continually perceiving details ever more
varied in the phenomena we know, where our crude senses
used to be unable to detect any lack of unity. What we
thought to be simple becomes complex, and the march of
science seems to be towards diversity and complication.
Here, then, are two opposing tendencies, each of
which seems to triumph in turn. Which will win? If
the first wins, science is possible; but nothing provesthe theories of modern physics.
193
this à priori, and it may be that after unsuccessful ef-
forts to bend Nature to our ideal of unity in spite of
herself, we shall be submerged by the ever-rising flood
of our new riches and compelled to renounce all idea
of classification—to abandon our ideal, and to reduce
science to the mere recording of innumerable recipes.
In fact, we can give this question no answer. All that
we can do is to observe the science of to-day, and compare
it with that of yesterday. No doubt after this examination
we shall be in a position to offer a few conjectures.
Half-a-century ago hopes ran high indeed. The unity
of force had just been revealed to us by the discovery
of the conservation of energy and of its transformation.
This discovery also showed that the phenomena of heat
could be explained by molecular movements. Although
the nature of these movements was not exactly known, no
one doubted but that they would be ascertained before
long. As for light, the work seemed entirely completed.
So far as electricity was concerned, there was not so great
an advance. Electricity had just annexed magnetism.
This was a considerable and a definitive step towards
unity. But how was electricity in its turn to be brought
into the general unity, and how was it to be included in
the general universal mechanism? No one had the slight-science and hypothesis
194
est idea. As to the possibility of the inclusion, all were
agreed; they had faith. Finally, as far as the molecular
properties of material bodies are concerned, the inclusion
seemed easier, but the details were very hazy. In a word,
hopes were vast and strong, but vague.
To-day, what do we see? In the first place, a step in
advance—immense progress. The relations between light
and electricity are now known; the three domains of light,
electricity, and magnetism, formerly separated, are now
one; and this annexation seems definitive.
Nevertheless the conquest has caused us some sac-
rifices. Optical phenomena become particular cases in
electric phenomena; as long as the former remained iso-
lated, it was easy to explain them by movements which
were thought to be known in all their details. That was
easy enough; but any explanation to be accepted must
now cover the whole domain of electricity. This cannot
be done without difficulty.
The most satisfactory theory is that of Lorentz; it is
unquestionably the theory that best explains the known
facts, the one that throws into relief the greatest num-
ber of known relations, the one in which we find most
traces of definitive construction. That it still possesses a
serious fault I have shown above. It is in contradictionthe theories of modern physics.
195
with Newton’s law that action and reaction are equal and
opposite—or rather, this principle according to Lorentz
cannot be applicable to matter alone; if it be true, it must
take into account the action of the ether on matter, and
the reaction of the matter on the ether. Now, in the new
order, it is very likely that things do not happen in this
way.
However this may be, it is due to Lorentz that the
results of Fizeau on the optics of moving bodies, the laws
of normal and abnormal dispersion and of absorption are
connected with each other and with the other properties
of the ether, by bonds which no doubt will not be readily
severed. Look at the ease with which the new Zeeman
phenomenon found its place, and even aided the classifi-
cation of Faraday’s magnetic rotation, which had defied
all Maxwell’s efforts. This facility proves that Lorentz’s
theory is not a mere artificial combination which must
eventually find its solvent. It will probably have to be
modified, but not destroyed.
The only object of Lorentz was to include in a sin-
gle whole all the optics and electro-dynamics of moving
bodies; he did not claim to give a mechanical explana-
tion. Larmor goes further; keeping the essential part of
Lorentz’s theory, he grafts upon it, so to speak, Mac-science and hypothesis
196
Cullagh’s ideas on the direction of the movement of the
ether. MacCullagh held that the velocity of the ether
is the same in magnitude and direction as the magnetic
force. Ingenious as is this attempt, the fault in Lorentz’s
theory remains, and is even aggravated. According to
Lorentz, we do not know what the movements of the ether
are; and because we do not know this, we may suppose
them to be movements compensating those of matter,
and re-affirming that action and reaction are equal and
opposite. According to Larmor we know the movements
of the ether, and we can prove that the compensation
does not take place.
If Larmor has failed, as in my opinion he has, does
it necessarily follow that a mechanical explanation is im-
possible? Far from it. I said above that as long as a
phenomenon obeys the two principles of energy and least
action, so long it allows of an unlimited number of me-
chanical explanations. And so with the phenomena of
optics and electricity.
But this is not enough. For a mechanical explanation
to be good it must be simple; to choose it from among
all the explanations that are possible there must be other
reasons than the necessity of making a choice. Well, we
have no theory as yet which will satisfy this condition andthe theories of modern physics.
197
consequently be of any use. Are we then to complain?
That would be to forget the end we seek, which is not
the mechanism; the true and only aim is unity.
We ought therefore to set some limits to our ambition.
Let us not seek to formulate a mechanical explanation;
let us be content to show that we can always find one
if we wish. In this we have succeeded. The principle of
the conservation of energy has always been confirmed,
and now it has a fellow in the principle of least action,
stated in the form appropriate to physics. This has also
been verified, at least as far as concerns the reversible
phenomena which obey Lagrange’s equations—in other
words, which obey the most general laws of physics. The
irreversible phenomena are much more difficult to bring
into line; but they, too, are being co-ordinated and tend
to come into the unity. The light which illuminates them
comes from Carnot’s principle. For a long time thermo-
dynamics was confined to the study of the dilatations
of bodies and of their change of state. For some time
past it has been growing bolder, and has considerably
extended its domain. We owe to it the theories of the
voltaic cell and of their thermo-electric phenomena; there
is not a corner in physics which it has not explored, and it
has even attacked chemistry itself. The same laws holdscience and hypothesis
198
good; everywhere, disguised in some form or other, we
find Carnot’s principle; everywhere also appears that em-
inently abstract concept of entropy which is as universal
as the concept of energy, and like it, seems to conceal
a reality. It seemed that radiant heat must escape, but
recently that, too, has been brought under the same laws.
In this way fresh analogies are revealed which may
be often pursued in detail; electric resistance resembles
the viscosity of fluids; hysteresis would rather be like the
friction of solids. In all cases friction appears to be the
type most imitated by the most diverse irreversible phe-
nomena, and this relationship is real and profound.
A strictly mechanical explanation of these phenom-
ena has also been sought, but, owing to their nature, it
is hardly likely that it will be found. To find it, it has
been necessary to suppose that the irreversibility is but
apparent, that the elementary phenomena are reversible
and obey the known laws of dynamics. But the elements
are extremely numerous, and become blended more and
more, so that to our crude sight all appears to tend to-
wards uniformity—i.e., all seems to progress in the same
direction, and that without hope of return. The apparent
irreversibility is therefore but an effect of the law of great
numbers. Only a being of infinitely subtle senses, suchthe theories of modern physics.
199
as Maxwell’s demon, could unravel this tangled skein and
turn back the course of the universe.
This conception, which is connected with the kinetic
theory of gases, has cost great effort and has not, on the
whole, been fruitful; it may become so. This is not the
place to examine if it leads to contradictions, and if it is
in conformity with the true nature of things.
Let us notice, however, the original ideas of M. Gouy
on the Brownian movement. According to this scientist,
this singular movement does not obey Carnot’s principle.
The particles which it sets moving would be smaller than
the meshes of that tightly drawn net; they would thus
be ready to separate them, and thereby to set back the
course of the universe. One can almost see Maxwell’s
demon at work. 1
To resume, phenomena long known are gradually be-
ing better classified, but new phenomena come to claim
their place, and most of them, like the Zeeman effect,
find it at once. Then we have the cathode rays, the X-
rays, uranium and radium rays; in fact, a whole world

of which none had suspected the existence. How many
unexpected guests to find a place for! No one can yet
predict the place they will occupy, but I do not believe
they will destroy the general unity: I think that they
will rather complete it. On the one hand, indeed, the
new radiations seem to be connected with the phenom-
ena of luminosity; not only do they excite fluorescence,
but they sometimes come into existence under the same
conditions as that property; neither are they unrelated
to the cause which produces the electric spark under the
action of ultra-violet light. Finally, and most important
of all, it is believed that in all these phenomena there
exist ions, animated, it is true, with velocities far greater
than those of electrolytes. All this is very vague, but it
will all become clearer.
Phosphorescence and the action of light on the spark
were regions rather isolated, and consequently somewhat
neglected by investigators. It is to be hoped that a new
path will now be made which will facilitate their com-
munications with the rest of science. Not only do we
discover new phenomena, but those we think we know
are revealed in unlooked-for aspects. In the free ether
the laws preserve their majestic simplicity, but matter
properly so called seems more and more complex; all wethe theories of modern physics.

can say of it is but approximate, and our formulæ are
constantly requiring new terms.
But the ranks are unbroken, the relations that we
have discovered between objects we thought simple still
hold good between the same objects when their complex-
ity is recognised, and that alone is the important thing.
Our equations become, it is true, more and more com-
plicated, so as to embrace more closely the complexity
of nature; but nothing is changed in the relations which
enable these equations to be derived from each other. In
a word, the form of these equations persists. Take for in-
stance the laws of reflection. Fresnel established them by
a simple and attractive theory which experiment seemed
to confirm. Subsequently, more accurate researches have
shown that this verification was but approximate; traces
of elliptic polarisation were detected everywhere. But it
is owing to the first approximation that the cause of these
anomalies was found in the existence of a transition layer,
and all the essentials of Fresnel’s theory have remained.
We cannot help reflecting that all these relations would
never have been noted if there had been doubt in the first
place as to the complexity of the objects they connect.
Long ago it was said: If Tycho had had instruments ten
times as precise, we would never have had a Kepler, orscience and hypothesis
202
a Newton, or Astronomy. It is a misfortune for a science
to be born too late, when the means of observation have
become too perfect. That is what is happening at this
moment with respect to physical chemistry; the founders
are hampered in their general grasp by third and fourth
decimal places; happily they are men of robust faith. As
we get to know the properties of matter better we see
that continuity reigns. From the work of Andrews and
Van der Waals, we see how the transition from the liquid
to the gaseous state is made, and that it is not abrupt.
Similarly, there is no gap between the liquid and solid
states, and in the proceedings of a recent Congress we
see memoirs on the rigidity of liquids side by side with
papers on the flow of solids.
With this tendency there is no doubt a loss of simplic-
ity. Such and such an effect was represented by straight
lines; it is now necessary to connect these lines by more
or less complicated curves. On the other hand, unity is
gained. Separate categories quieted but did not satisfy
the mind.
Finally, a new domain, that of chemistry, has been
invaded by the method of physics, and we see the birth of
physical chemistry. It is still quite young, but already it
has enabled us to connect such phenomena as electrolysis,the theories of modern physics.</p>
<p>osmosis, and the movements of ions.</p>
<p>From this cursory exposition what can we conclude?
Taking all things into account, we have approached the
realisation of unity. This has not been done as quickly as
was hoped fifty years ago, and the path predicted has not
always been followed; but, on the whole, much ground has been gained.</p>
