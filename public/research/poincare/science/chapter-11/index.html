                        <p>What has that calculus to do with physical science? The questions I shall raise—without, however, giving them
a solution—are naturally raised by the philosopher who
is examining the problems of physics. So far is this the
case, that in the two preceding chapters I have several
times used the words “probability” and “chance.”</p>
<p>“Predicted facts can only be probable.”</p>
<p>However solidly founded a prediction may appear to be,
we are never absolutely certain that experiment will not
prove it false; but the probability is often so great that
practically it may be accepted. And a little farther on I
added:—“See what a part the belief in simplicity plays in
our generalisations. We have verified a simple law in a
large number of particular cases, and we refuse to admit
that this so-often-repeated coincidence is a mere effect
of chance.” Thus, in a multitude of circumstances the
physicist is often in the same position as the gambler
who reckons up his chances. Every time that he reasons
by induction, he more or less consciously requires thethe calculus of probabilities.
205
calculus of probabilities, and that is why I am obliged to
open this chapter parenthetically, and to interrupt our
discussion of method in the physical sciences in order to
examine a little closer what this calculus is worth, and
what dependence we may place upon it. The very name
of the calculus of probabilities is a paradox. Probability
as opposed to certainty is what one does not know, and
how can we calculate the unknown? Yet many eminent
scientists have devoted themselves to this calculus, and
it cannot be denied that science has drawn therefrom no
small advantage. How can we explain this apparent con-
tradiction? Has probability been defined? Can it even be
defined? And if it cannot, how can we venture to reason
upon it? The definition, it will be said, is very simple.
The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of
cases favourable to the event to the total number of pos-
sible cases. A simple example will show how incomplete
this definition is:—I throw two dice. What is the prob-
ability that one of the two at least turns up a 6? Each
can turn up in six different ways; the number of possi-
ble cases is 6 × 6 = 36. The number of favourable cases
11
is 11; the probability is . That is the correct solution.
36
But why cannot we just as well proceed as follows?—Thescience and hypothesis
206
6 × 7
points which turn up on the two dice form
= 21
2
different combinations. Among these combinations, six
6
are favourable; the probability is
. Now why is the
21
first method of calculating the number of possible cases
more legitimate than the second? In any case it is not the
definition that tells us. We are therefore bound to com-
plete the definition by saying, “. . . to the total number of
possible cases, provided the cases are equally probable.”
So we are compelled to define the probable by the proba-
ble. How can we know that two possible cases are equally
probable? Will it be by a convention? If we insert at the
beginning of every problem an explicit convention, well
and good! We then have nothing to do but to apply the
rules of arithmetic and algebra, and we complete our cal-
culation, when our result cannot be called in question.
But if we wish to make the slightest application of this
result, we must prove that our convention is legitimate,
and we shall find ourselves in the presence of the very dif-
ficulty we thought we had avoided. It may be said that
common-sense is enough to show us the convention that
should be adopted. Alas! M. Bertrand has amused him-
self by discussing the following simple problem:—“What
is the probability that a chord of a circle may be greaterthe calculus of probabilities.
207
than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle?” The
illustrious geometer successively adopted two conventions
which seemed to be equally imperative in the eyes of
common-sense, and with one convention he finds 12 , and
with the other 13 . The conclusion which seems to follow
from this is that the calculus of probabilities is a useless
science, that the obscure instinct which we call common-
sense, and to which we appeal for the legitimisation of
our conventions, must be distrusted. But to this conclu-
sion we can no longer subscribe. We cannot do without
that obscure instinct. Without it, science would be im-
possible, and without it we could neither discover nor
apply a law. Have we any right, for instance, to enun-
ciate Newton’s law? No doubt numerous observations
are in agreement with it, but is not that a simple fact
of chance? and how do we know, besides, that this law
which has been true for so many generations will not be
untrue in the next? To this objection the only answer you
can give is: It is very improbable. But grant the law. By
means of it I can calculate the position of Jupiter in a
year from now. Yet have I any right to say this? Who
can tell if a gigantic mass of enormous velocity is not
going to pass near the solar system and produce unfore-
seen perturbations? Here again the only answer is: It isscience and hypothesis
208
very improbable. From this point of view all the sciences
would only be unconscious applications of the calculus
of probabilities. And if this calculus be condemned, then
the whole of the sciences must also be condemned. I shall
not dwell at length on scientific problems in which the in-
tervention of the calculus of probabilities is more evident.
In the forefront of these is the problem of interpolation, in
which, knowing a certain number of values of a function,
we try to discover the intermediary values. I may also
mention the celebrated theory of errors of observation,
to which I shall return later; the kinetic theory of gases,
a well-known hypothesis wherein each gaseous molecule
is supposed to describe an extremely complicated path,
but in which, through the effect of great numbers, the
mean phenomena which are all we observe obey the sim-
ple laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac. All these theories
are based upon the laws of great numbers, and the cal-
culus of probabilities would evidently involve them in its
ruin. It is true that they have only a particular interest,
and that, save as far as interpolation is concerned, they
are sacrifices to which we might readily be resigned. But
I have said above, it would not be these partial sacrifices
that would be in question; it would be the legitimacy of
the whole of science that would be challenged. I quite seethe calculus of probabilities.
209
that it might be said: We do not know, and yet we must
act. As for action, we have not time to devote ourselves
to an inquiry that will suffice to dispel our ignorance.
Besides, such an inquiry would demand unlimited time.
We must therefore make up our minds without knowing.
This must be often done whatever may happen, and we
must follow the rules although we may have but little
confidence in them. What I know is, not that such a
thing is true, but that the best course for me is to act as
if it were true. The calculus of probabilities, and there-
fore science itself, would be no longer of any practical
value.
Unfortunately the difficulty does not thus disappear.
A gambler wants to try a coup, and he asks my advice.
If I give it him, I use the calculus of probabilities; but
I shall not guarantee success. That is what I shall call
subjective probability. In this case we might be content
with the explanation of which I have just given a sketch.
But assume that an observer is present at the play, that
he knows of the coup, and that play goes on for a long
time, and that he makes a summary of his notes. He
will find that events have taken place in conformity with
the laws of the calculus of probabilities. That is what I
shall call objective probability, and it is this phenomenonscience and hypothesis
210
which has to be explained. There are numerous Insur-
ance Societies which apply the rules of the calculus of
probabilities, and they distribute to their shareholders
dividends, the objective reality of which cannot be con-
tested. In order to explain them, we must do more than
invoke our ignorance and the necessity of action. Thus,
absolute scepticism is not admissible. We may distrust,
but we cannot condemn en bloc. Discussion is necessary.
I. Classification of the Problems of Probability.—In
order to classify the problems which are presented to us
with reference to probabilities, we must look at them
from different points of view, and first of all, from that
of generality. I said above that probability is the ratio
of the number of favourable to the number of possible
cases. What for want of a better term I call general-
ity will increase with the number of possible cases. This
number may be finite, as, for instance, if we take a throw
of the dice in which the number of possible cases is 36.
That is the first degree of generality. But if we ask, for
instance, what is the probability that a point within a
circle is within the inscribed square, there are as many
possible cases as there are points in the circle—that is to
say, an infinite number. This is the second degree of gen-
erality. Generality can be pushed further still. We maythe calculus of probabilities.
211
ask the probability that a function will satisfy a given
condition. There are then as many possible cases as one
can imagine different functions. This is the third degree
of generality, which we reach, for instance, when we try
to find the most probable law after a finite number of
observations. Yet we may place ourselves at a quite dif-
ferent point of view. If we were not ignorant there would
be no probability, there could only be certainty. But our
ignorance cannot be absolute, for then there would be
no longer any probability at all. Thus the problems of
probability may be classed according to the greater or
less depth of this ignorance. In mathematics we may set
ourselves problems in probability. What is the probabil-
ity that the fifth decimal of a logarithm taken at random
from a table is a 9. There is no hesitation in answering
1
. Here we possess all the data
that this probability is 10
of the problem. We can calculate our logarithm without
having recourse to the table, but we need not give our-
selves the trouble. This is the first degree of ignorance.
In the physical sciences our ignorance is already greater.
The state of a system at a given moment depends on
two things—its initial state, and the law according to
which that state varies. If we know both this law and
this initial state, we have a simple mathematical prob-science and hypothesis
212
lem to solve, and we fall back upon our first degree of
ignorance. Then it often happens that we know the law
and do not know the initial state. It may be asked, for
instance, what is the present distribution of the minor
planets? We know that from all time they have obeyed
the laws of Kepler, but we do not know what was their
initial distribution. In the kinetic theory of gases we as-
sume that the gaseous molecules follow rectilinear paths
and obey the laws of impact and elastic bodies; yet as we
know nothing of their initial velocities, we know nothing
of their present velocities. The calculus of probabilities
alone enables us to predict the mean phenomena which
will result from a combination of these velocities. This
is the second degree of ignorance. Finally it is possible,
that not only the initial conditions but the laws them-
selves are unknown. We then reach the third degree of
ignorance, and in general we can no longer affirm any-
thing at all as to the probability of a phenomenon. It
often happens that instead of trying to discover an event
by means of a more or less imperfect knowledge of the
law, the events may be known, and we want to find the
law; or that, instead of deducing effects from causes, we
wish to deduce the causes from the effects. Now, these
problems are classified as probability of causes, and arethe calculus of probabilities.
213
the most interesting of all from their scientific applica-
tions. I play at écarté with a gentleman whom I know
to be perfectly honest. What is the chance that he turns
up the king? It is 18 . This is a problem of the probability
of effects. I play with a gentleman whom I do not know.
He has dealt ten times, and he has turned the king up six
times. What is the chance that he is a sharper? This is a
problem in the probability of causes. It may be said that
it is the essential problem of the experimental method. I
have observed n values of x and the corresponding values
of y. I have found that the ratio of the latter to the former
is practically constant. There is the event; what is the
cause? Is it probable that there is a general law according
to which y would be proportional to x, and that small
divergencies are due to errors of observation? This is the
type of question that we are ever asking, and which we
unconsciously solve whenever we are engaged in scientific
work. I am now going to pass in review these different
categories of problems by discussing in succession what I
have called subjective and objective probability.
II. Probability in Mathematics.—The impossibility
of squaring the circle was shown in 1885, but before
that date all geometers considered this impossibility as
so “probable” that the Académie des Sciences rejectedscience and hypothesis
214
without examination the, alas! too numerous memoirs on
this subject that a few unhappy madmen sent in every
year. Was the Académie wrong? Evidently not, and it
knew perfectly well that by acting in this manner it did
not run the least risk of stifling a discovery of moment.
The Académie could not have proved that it was right,
but it knew quite well that its instinct did not deceive
it. If you had asked the Academicians, they would have
answered: “We have compared the probability that an
unknown scientist should have found out what has been
vainly sought for so long, with the probability that there
is one madman the more on the earth, and the latter
has appeared to us the greater.” These are very good
reasons, but there is nothing mathematical about them;
they are purely psychological. If you had pressed them
further, they would have added: “Why do you expect a
particular value of a transcendental function to be an
algebraical number; if π be the root of an algebraical
equation, why do you expect this root to be a period
of the function sin 2x, and why is it not the same with
the other roots of the same equation?” To sum up, they
would have invoked the principle of sufficient reason in
its vaguest form. Yet what information could they draw
from it? At most a rule of conduct for the employmentthe calculus of probabilities.
215
of their time, which would be more usefully spent at
their ordinary work than in reading a lucubration that
inspired in them a legitimate distrust. But what I called
above objective probability has nothing in common with
this first problem. It is otherwise with the second. Let
us consider the first 10, 000 logarithms that we find in
a table. Among these 10, 000 logarithms I take one at
random. What is the probability that its third decimal
is an even number? You will say without any hesitation
that the probability is 12 , and in fact if you pick out in
a table the third decimals in these 10, 000 numbers you
will find nearly as many even digits as odd. Or, if you
prefer it, let us write 10, 000 numbers corresponding to
our 10, 000 logarithms, writing down for each of these
numbers +1 if the third decimal of the corresponding
logarithm is even, and −1 if odd; and then let us take
the mean of these 10, 000 numbers. I do not hesitate
to say that the mean of these 10, 000 units is probably
zero, and if I were to calculate it practically, I would
verify that it is extremely small. But this verification is
needless. I might have rigorously proved that this mean
is smaller than 0.003. To prove this result I should have
had to make a rather long calculation for which there is
no room here, and for which I may refer the reader toscience and hypothesis
216
an article that I published in the Revue générale des Sci-
ences, April 15th, 1899. The only point to which I wish
to draw attention is the following. In this calculation I
had occasion to rest my case on only two facts—namely,
that the first and second derivatives of the logarithm re-
main, in the interval considered, between certain limits.
Hence our first conclusion is that the property is not
only true of the logarithm but of any continuous func-
tion whatever, since the derivatives of every continuous
function are limited. If I was certain beforehand of the
result, it is because I have often observed analogous facts
for other continuous functions; and next, it is because I
went through in my mind in a more or less unconscious
and imperfect manner the reasoning which led me to
the preceding inequalities, just as a skilled calculator
before finishing his multiplication takes into account
what it ought to come to approximately. And besides,
since what I call my intuition was only an incomplete
summary of a piece of true reasoning, it is clear that
observation has confirmed my predictions, and that the
objective and subjective probabilities are in agreement.
As a third example I shall choose the following:—The
number u is taken at random and n is a given very large
integer. What is the mean value of sin nu? This problemthe calculus of probabilities.
217
has no meaning by itself. To give it one, a convention is
required—namely, we agree that the probability for the
number u to lie between a and a + da is φ(a) da; that it is
therefore proportional to the infinitely small interval da,
and is equal to this multiplied by a function φ(a), only
depending on a. As for this function I choose it arbitrar-
ily, but I must assume it to be continuous. The value
of sin nu remaining the same when u increases by 2π, I
may without loss of generality assume that u lies between
0 and 2π, and I shall thus be led to suppose that φ(a) is
a periodic function whose period is 2π. The mean value
that we seek is readily expressed by a simple integral,
and it is easy to show that this integral is smaller than
2πM K
,
n K
M K being the maximum value of the Kth derivative
of φ(u). We see then that if the Kth derivative is finite,
our mean value will tend towards zero when n increases
1
indefinitely, and that more rapidly than K+1 .
n
The mean value of sin nu when n is very large is there-
fore zero. To define this value I required a convention,
but the result remains the same whatever that convention
may be. I have imposed upon myself but slight restric-science and hypothesis
218
tions when I assumed that the function φ(a) is continuous
and periodic, and these hypotheses are so natural that we
may ask ourselves how they can be escaped. Examina-
tion of the three preceding examples, so different in all
respects, has already given us a glimpse on the one hand
of the rôle of what philosophers call the principle of suffi-
cient reason, and on the other hand of the importance of
the fact that certain properties are common to all contin-
uous functions. The study of probability in the physical
sciences will lead us to the same result.
III. Probability in the Physical Sciences.—We now
come to the problems which are connected with what
I have called the second degree of ignorance—namely,
those in which we know the law but do not know the ini-
tial state of the system. I could multiply examples, but
I shall take only one. What is the probable present dis-
tribution of the minor planets on the zodiac? We know
they obey the laws of Kepler. We may even, without
changing the nature of the problem, suppose that their
orbits are circular and situated in the same plane, a plane
which we are given. On the other hand, we know abso-
lutely nothing about their initial distribution. However,
we do not hesitate to affirm that this distribution is now
nearly uniform. Why? Let b be the longitude of a minorthe calculus of probabilities.
219
planet in the initial epoch—that is to say, the epoch zero.
Let a be its mean motion. Its longitude at the present
time—i.e., at the time t will be at + b. To say that the
present distribution is uniform is to say that the mean
value of the sines and cosines of multiples of at + b is
zero. Why do we assert this? Let us represent our minor
planet by a point in a plane—namely, the point whose
co-ordinates are a and b. All these representative points
will be contained in a certain region of the plane, but
as they are very numerous this region will appear dotted
with points. We know nothing else about the distribu-
tion of the points. Now what do we do when we apply
the calculus of probabilities to such a question as this?
What is the probability that one or more representative
points may be found in a certain portion of the plane?
In our ignorance we are compelled to make an arbitrary
hypothesis. To explain the nature of this hypothesis I
may be allowed to use, instead of a mathematical for-
mula, a crude but concrete image. Let us suppose that
over the surface of our plane has been spread imaginary
matter, the density of which is variable, but varies con-
tinuously. We shall then agree to say that the probable
number of representative points to be found on a cer-
tain portion of the plane is proportional to the quantityscience and hypothesis
220
of this imaginary matter which is found there. If there
are, then, two regions of the plane of the same extent,
the probabilities that a representative point of one of our
minor planets is in one or other of these regions will be
as the mean densities of the imaginary matter in one or
other of the regions. Here then are two distributions, one
real, in which the representative points are very numer-
ous, very close together, but discrete like the molecules of
matter in the atomic hypothesis; the other remote from
reality, in which our representative points are replaced by
imaginary continuous matter. We know that the latter
cannot be real, but we are forced to adopt it through our
ignorance. If, again, we had some idea of the real distri-
bution of the representative points, we could arrange it so
that in a region of some extent the density of this imag-
inary continuous matter may be nearly proportional to
the number of representative points, or, if it is preferred,
to the number of atoms which are contained in that re-
gion. Even that is impossible, and our ignorance is so
great that we are forced to choose arbitrarily the func-
tion which defines the density of our imaginary matter.
We shall be compelled to adopt a hypothesis from which
we can hardly get away; we shall suppose that this func-
tion is continuous. That is sufficient, as we shall see, tothe calculus of probabilities.
221
enable us to reach our conclusion.
What is at the instant t the probable distribution of
the minor planets—or rather, what is the mean value
of the sine of the longitude at the moment t—i.e., of
sin(at + b)? We made at the outset an arbitrary conven-
tion, but if we adopt it, this probable value is entirely
defined. Let us decompose the plane into elements of
surface. Consider the value of sin(at + b) at the centre
of each of these elements. Multiply this value by the
surface of the element and by the corresponding density
of the imaginary matter. Let us then take the sum for
all the elements of the plane. This sum, by definition,
will be the probable mean value we seek, which will thus
be expressed by a double integral. It may be thought
at first that this mean value depends on the choice of
the function φ which defines the density of the imagi-
nary matter, and as this function φ is arbitrary, we can,
according to the arbitrary choice which we make, ob-
tain a certain mean value. But this is not the case. A
simple calculation shows us that our double integral de-
creases very rapidly as t increases. Thus, I cannot tell
what hypothesis to make as to the probability of this or
that initial distribution, but when once the hypothesis is
made the result will be the same, and this gets me outscience and hypothesis
222
of my difficulty. Whatever the function φ may be, the
mean value tends towards zero as t increases, and as the
minor planets have certainly accomplished a very large
number of revolutions, I may assert that this mean value
is very small. I may give to φ any value I choose, with
one restriction: this function must be continuous; and,
in fact, from the point of view of subjective probability,
the choice of a discontinuous function would have been
unreasonable. What reason could I have, for instance, for
supposing that the initial longitude might be exactly 0 ◦ ,
but that it could not lie between 0 ◦ and 1 ◦ ?
The difficulty reappears if we look at it from the point
of view of objective probability; if we pass from our imag-
inary distribution in which the supposititious matter was
assumed to be continuous, to the real distribution in
which our representative points are formed as discrete
atoms. The mean value of sin(at + b) will be represented
quite simply by
1 X
sin(at + b),
n
n being the number of minor planets. Instead of a double
integral referring to a continuous function, we shall have
a sum of discrete terms. However, no one will seriously
doubt that this mean value is practically very small. Ourthe calculus of probabilities.
223
representative points being very close together, our dis-
crete sum will in general differ very little from an integral.
An integral is the limit towards which a sum of terms
tends when the number of these terms is indefinitely in-
creased. If the terms are very numerous, the sum will
differ very little from its limit—that is to say, from the
integral, and what I said of the latter will still be true of
the sum itself. But there are exceptions. If, for instance,
π
− at, the longitude of
for all the minor planets b =
2
π
all the planets at the time t would be , and the mean
2
value in question would be evidently unity. For this to
be the case at the time 0, the minor planets must have
all been lying on a kind of spiral of peculiar form, with
its spires very close together. All will admit that such an
initial distribution is extremely improbable (and even if
it were realised, the distribution would not be uniform at
the present time—for example, on the 1st January 1900;
but it would become so a few years later). Why, then, do
we think this initial distribution improbable? This must
be explained, for if we are wrong in rejecting as improb-
able this absurd hypothesis, our inquiry breaks down,
and we can no longer affirm anything on the subject of
the probability of this or that present distribution. Oncescience and hypothesis
224
more we shall invoke the principle of sufficient reason, to
which we must always recur. We might admit that at
the beginning the planets were distributed almost in a
straight line. We might admit that they were irregularly
distributed. But it seems to us that there is no sufficient
reason for the unknown cause that gave them birth to
have acted along a curve so regular and yet so compli-
cated, which would appear to have been expressly chosen
so that the distribution at the present day would not be
uniform.
IV. Rouge et Noir.—The questions raised by games of
chance, such as roulette, are, fundamentally, quite analo-
gous to those we have just treated. For example, a wheel
is divided into a large number of equal compartments, al-
ternately red and black. A ball is spun round the wheel,
and after having moved round a number of times, it stops
in front of one of these sub-divisions. The probability
that the division is red is obviously 12 . The needle de-
scribes an angle θ, including several complete revolutions.
I do not know what is the probability that the ball is
spun with such a force that this angle should lie between
θ and θ + dθ, but I can make a convention. I can suppose
that this probability is φ(θ) dθ. As for the function φ(θ),
I can choose it in an entirely arbitrary manner. I havethe calculus of probabilities.
225
nothing to guide me in my choice, but I am naturally in-
duced to suppose the function to be continuous. Let  be
a length (measured on the circumference of the circle of
radius unity) of each red and black compartment. We
have to calculate the integral of φ(θ) dθ, extending it on
the one hand to all the red, and on the other hand to
all the black compartments, and to compare the results.
Consider an interval 2 comprising two consecutive red
and black compartments. Let M and m be the maxi-
mum and minimum values of the function φ(θ) in this
interval. The integral P extended to the red compartments
will be smaller than
M; extended to the black it will
P
be greater than
m.
The difference will therefore be
P
smaller than (M − m). But if the function φ is sup-
posed continuous, and if on the other hand the interval 
is very small with respect to the total angle described by
the needle, the difference M − m will be very small. The
difference of the two integrals will be therefore very small,
and the probability will be very nearly 2 1 . We see that
without knowing anything of the function φ we must act
as if the probability were 12 . And on the other hand it ex-
plains why, from the objective point of view, if I watch a
certain number of coups, observation will give me almost
as many black coups as red. All the players know thisscience and hypothesis
226
objective law; but it leads them into a remarkable error,
which has often been exposed, but into which they are
always falling. When the red has won, for example, six
times running, they bet on black, thinking that they are
playing an absolutely safe game, because they say it is a
very rare thing for the red to win seven times running. In
reality their probability of winning is still 12 . Observation
shows, it is true, that the series of seven consecutive reds
is very rare, but series of six reds followed by a black are
also very rare. They have noticed the rarity of the series
of seven reds; if they have not remarked the rarity of six
reds and a black, it is only because such series strike the
attention less.
V. The Probability of Causes.—We now come to the
problems of the probability of causes, the most impor-
tant from the point of view of scientific applications. Two
stars, for instance, are very close together on the celes-
tial sphere. Is this apparent contiguity a mere effect of
chance? Are these stars, although almost on the same
visual ray, situated at very different distances from the
earth, and therefore very far indeed from one another? or
does the apparent correspond to a real contiguity? This
is a problem on the probability of causes.
First of all, I recall that at the outset of all problemsthe calculus of probabilities.
227
of probability of effects that have occupied our attention
up to now, we have had to use a convention which was
more or less justified; and if in most cases the result was
to a certain extent independent of this convention, it was
only the condition of certain hypotheses which enabled
us à priori to reject discontinuous functions, for example,
or certain absurd conventions. We shall again find some-
thing analogous to this when we deal with the probability
of causes. An effect may be produced by the cause a or
by the cause b. The effect has just been observed. We
ask the probability that it is due to the cause a. This
is an à posteriori probability of cause. But I could not
calculate it, if a convention more or less justified did not
tell me in advance what is the à priori probability for
the cause a to come into play—I mean the probability of
this event to some one who had not observed the effect.
To make my meaning clearer, I go back to the game of
écarté mentioned before. My adversary deals for the first
time and turns up a king. What is the probability that
he is a sharper? The formulæ ordinarily taught give 9 8 ,
a result which is obviously rather surprising. If we look
at it closer, we see that the conclusion is arrived at as if,
before sitting down at the table, I had considered that
there was one chance in two that my adversary was notscience and hypothesis
228
honest. An absurd hypothesis, because in that case I
should certainly not have played with him; and this ex-
plains the absurdity of the conclusion. The function on
the à priori probability was unjustified, and that is why
the conclusion of the à posteriori probability led me into
an inadmissible result. The importance of this prelimi-
nary convention is obvious. I shall even add that if none
were made, the problem of the à posteriori probability
would have no meaning. It must be always made either
explicitly or tacitly.
Let us pass on to an example of a more scientific
character. I require to determine an experimental law;
this law, when discovered, can be represented by a curve.
I make a certain number of isolated observations, each
of which may be represented by a point. When I have
obtained these different points, I draw a curve between
them as carefully as possible, giving my curve a regular
form, avoiding sharp angles, accentuated inflexions, and
any sudden variation of the radius of curvature. This
curve will represent to me the probable law, and not only
will it give me the values of the functions intermediary to
those which have been observed, but it also gives me the
observed values more accurately than direct observation
does; that is why I make the curve pass near the pointsthe calculus of probabilities.
229
and not through the points themselves.
Here, then, is a problem in the probability of causes.
The effects are the measurements I have recorded; they
depend on the combination of two causes—the true law
of the phenomenon and errors of observation. Know-
ing the effects, we have to find the probability that the
phenomenon shall obey this law or that, and that the
observations have been accompanied by this or that er-
ror. The most probable law, therefore, corresponds to the
curve we have traced, and the most probable error is rep-
resented by the distance of the corresponding point from
that curve. But the problem has no meaning if before
the observations I had an à priori idea of the probability
of this law or that, or of the chances of error to which
I am exposed. If my instruments are good (and I knew
whether this is so or not before beginning the observa-
tions), I shall not draw the curve far from the points
which represent the rough measurements. If they are in-
ferior, I may draw it a little farther from the points, so
that I may get a less sinuous curve; much will be sacri-
ficed to regularity.
Why, then, do I draw a curve without sinuosities?
Because I consider à priori a law represented by a con-
tinuous function (or function the derivatives of which toscience and hypothesis
230
a high order are small), as more probable than a law not
satisfying those conditions. But for this conviction the
problem would have no meaning; interpolation would be
impossible; no law could be deduced from a finite number
of observations; science would cease to exist.
Fifty years ago physicists considered, other things be-
ing equal, a simple law as more probable than a compli-
cated law. This principle was even invoked in favour
of Mariotte’s law as against that of Regnault. But this
belief is now repudiated; and yet, how many times are
we compelled to act as though we still held it! However
that may be, what remains of this tendency is the be-
lief in continuity, and as we have just seen, if the belief in
continuity were to disappear, experimental science would
become impossible.
VI. The Theory of Errors.—We are thus brought to
consider the theory of errors which is directly connected
with the problem of the probability of causes. Here again
we find effects—to wit, a certain number of irreconcilable
observations, and we try to find the causes which are, on
the one hand, the true value of the quantity to be mea-
sured, and, on the other, the error made in each isolated
observation. We must calculate the probable à posteri-
ori value of each error, and therefore the probable valuethe calculus of probabilities.
231
of the quantity to be measured. But, as I have just ex-
plained, we cannot undertake this calculation unless we
admit à priori —i.e., before any observations are made—
that there is a law of the probability of errors. Is there
a law of errors? The law to which all calculators assent
is Gauss’s law, that is represented by a certain transcen-
dental curve known as the “bell.”
But it is first of all necessary to recall the classic dis-
tinction between systematic and accidental errors. If the
metre with which we measure a length is too long, the
number we get will be too small, and it will be no use to
measure several times—that is a systematic error. If we
measure with an accurate metre, we may make a mistake,
and find the length sometimes too large and sometimes
too small, and when we take the mean of a large num-
ber of measurements, the error will tend to grow small.
These are accidental errors.
It is clear that systematic errors do not satisfy Gauss’s
law, but do accidental errors satisfy it? Numerous proofs
have been attempted, almost all of them crude paralo-
gisms. But starting from the following hypotheses we
may prove Gauss’s law: the error is the result of a very
large number of partial and independent errors; each par-
tial error is very small and obeys any law of probabilityscience and hypothesis
232
whatever, provided the probability of a positive error is
the same as that of an equal negative error. It is clear
that these conditions will be often, but not always, ful-
filled, and we may reserve the name of accidental for er-
rors which satisfy them.
We see that the method of least squares is not legit-
imate in every case; in general, physicists are more dis-
trustful of it than astronomers. This is no doubt because
the latter, apart from the systematic errors to which
they and the physicists are subject alike, have to contend
with an extremely important source of error which is en-
tirely accidental—I mean atmospheric undulations. So it
is very curious to hear a discussion between a physicist
and an astronomer about a method of observation. The
physicist, persuaded that one good measurement is worth
more than many bad ones, is pre-eminently concerned
with the elimination by means of every precaution of the
final systematic errors; the astronomer retorts: “But you
can only observe a small number of stars, and accidental
errors will not disappear.”
What conclusion must we draw? Must we continue to
use the method of least squares? We must distinguish.
We have eliminated all the systematic errors of which
we have any suspicion; we are quite certain that therethe calculus of probabilities.</p>
<p>are others still, but we cannot detect them; and yet we
must make up our minds and adopt a definitive value
which will be regarded as the probable value; and for
that purpose it is clear that the best thing we can do is
to apply Gauss’s law. We have only applied a practical
rule referring to subjective probability. And there is no
more to be said.</p>
<p>Yet we want to go farther and say that not only the
probable value is so much, but that the probable error in
the result is so much. This is absolutely invalid : it would
be true only if we were sure that all the systematic errors
were eliminated, and of that we know absolutely nothing.
We have two series of observations; by applying the law
of least squares we find that the probable error in the
first series is twice as small as in the second. The second
series may, however, be more accurate than the first, be-
cause the first is perhaps affected by a large systematic
error. All that we can say is, that the first series is prob-
ably better than the second because its accidental error
is smaller, and that we have no reason for affirming that
the systematic error is greater for one of the series than
for the other, our ignorance on this point being absolute.</p>
<p>VII. Conclusions</p>
<p>In the preceding lines I have set several problems, and have given no solution. I do not re-science and hypothesis gret this, for perhaps they will invite the reader to reflect
on these delicate questions.
However that may be, there are certain points which
seem to be well established. To undertake the calcula-
tion of any probability, and even for that calculation to
have any meaning at all, we must admit, as a point of
departure, an hypothesis or convention which has always
something arbitrary about it. In the choice of this con-
vention we can be guided only by the principle of suffi-
cient reason. Unfortunately, this principle is very vague
and very elastic, and in the cursory examination we have
just made we have seen it assume different forms. The
form under which we meet it most often is the belief in
continuity, a belief which it would be difficult to justify
by apodeictic reasoning, but without which all science
would be impossible. Finally, the problems to which the
calculus of probabilities may be applied with profit are
those in which the result is independent of the hypothe-
sis made at the outset, provided only that this hypothesis
satisfies the condition of continuity.</p>
