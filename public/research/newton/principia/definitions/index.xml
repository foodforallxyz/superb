      <description>Mass is the amount of matter in a body   Air that is 2x density in a 2x space is 4x in mass.
 In 3x space, it becomes 6x in mass  This mass is known by the weight of the body because mass is proportional to weight. I have proven this through accurate pendulums.
This definition does not care about any medium that pervades the gaps within bodies.</description>

      <description>I classify time, space, place, and motion as:
 absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and common.  1. Time Absolute, true, and mathematical time flow equably without regard to anything external. It is also called duration.
Relative, apparent, and common time, is a sensible and external measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used. Examples are= an hour, a day, a month, a year.</description>
