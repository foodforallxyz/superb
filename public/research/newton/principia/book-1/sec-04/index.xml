      <description>LEMMA 15 If from the two foci S, H, of any ellipsis or hyberbola, we draw to any third point V the right lines SV, HV, where one HV is equal to the principal axis of the shape (the axis in which the foci are situated, the other SV is bisected in T by the perpendicular TR that falls on it. That perpendicular TR will touch the conic section somwhere. Vice versa, if it does touch it, HV will be equal to the principal axis of the shape.</description>

      <description>Proposition 20 PROBLEM 12 Around a given focus to describe any trajectory given in specie which shall pass through given points, and touch right lines given by position.
CASE 1 Around the focus S it is required to describe a trajectory ABC, pass ing through two points B, C. Because the the ratio of the trajectory is given in specie, GAS principal axis to the distance of the foci to BS, and In that ratio take will be given.</description>
