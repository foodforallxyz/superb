      <description>&amp;ldquo;Things are said to &amp;lsquo;be&amp;rsquo; (1) in an accidental sense, (2) by their own nature.
&amp;ldquo;(1) In an accidental sense, e.g. we say &amp;rsquo;the righteous doer is musical&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;rsquo;the man is musical&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;rsquo;the musician is a man&amp;rsquo;, just as we say &amp;rsquo;the musician builds&amp;rsquo;, because the builder happens to be musical or the musician to be a builder; for here &amp;lsquo;one thing is another&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;one is an accident of another&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>Defining Cause</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-02/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-02/</guid>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;Cause&amp;rsquo; is
  that from which, as immanent material, a thing comes into being, e.g. the bronze is the cause of the statue and the silver of the saucer, and so are the classes which include these.
  The form or pattern, i.e. the definition of the essence, and the classes which include this (e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general are causes of the octave), and the parts included in the definition.</description>

      <title>Defining Complete, Limit, Privation, etc</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;What is called &amp;lsquo;complete&amp;rsquo; is
  that outside which it is not possible to find any, even one, of its parts; e.g. the complete time of each thing is that outside which it is not possible to find any time which is a part proper to it.
  That which in respect of excellence and goodness cannot be excelled in its kind; e.g. we have a complete doctor or a complete flute-player, when they lack nothing in respect of the form of their proper excellence.</description>

      <title>Defining False and Accident</title>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-29/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The false&amp;rsquo; means
 that which is false as a thing, and that   because it is not put together or cannot be put together, e.g. &amp;rsquo;that the diagonal of a square is commensurate with the side&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;that you are sitting&amp;rsquo;; for one of these is false always, and the other sometimes; it is in these two senses that they are non-existent. There are things which exist, but whose nature it is to appear either not to be such as they are or to be things that do not exist, e.</description>

      <title>Defining Necessary</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-05/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-05/</guid>
      <description>&amp;rsquo;necessary&amp;rsquo; is
  (a) that without which, as a condition, a thing cannot live; e.g. breathing and food are necessary for an animal; for it is incapable of existing without these; (b) the conditions without which good cannot be or come to be, or without which we cannot get rid or be freed of evil; e.g. drinking the medicine is necessary in order that we may be cured of disease, and a man&amp;rsquo;s sailing to Aegina is necessary in order that he may get his money.</description>

      <title>Defining One and Many</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-06/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;One&amp;rsquo; means
  that which is one by accident,
  that which is one by its own nature.
  Accidental ones are &amp;lsquo;Coriscus and what is musical&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;musical Coriscus&amp;rsquo;
  (for it is the same thing to say &amp;lsquo;Coriscus and what is musical&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;musical Coriscus&amp;rsquo;), and &amp;lsquo;what is musical and what is just&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;musical Coriscus and just Coriscus&amp;rsquo;. For all of these are called one by virtue of an accident, &amp;lsquo;what is just and what is musical&amp;rsquo; because they are accidents of one substance, &amp;lsquo;what is musical and Coriscus&amp;rsquo; because the one is an accident of the other; and similarly in a sense &amp;lsquo;musical Coriscus&amp;rsquo; is one with &amp;lsquo;Coriscus&amp;rsquo; because one of the parts of the phrase is an accident of the other, i.</description>

      <title>Defining Part and Whole</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-25/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-25/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Part&amp;rsquo; means
 (a) that into which a quantum can in any way be divided; for that which is taken from a quantum qua quantum is always called a part of it, e.g. two is called in a sense a part of three.  b. of the parts in the first sense, only those which measure the whole; this is why two, though in one sense it is, in another is not, called a part of three.</description>

      <title>Defining Potency</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-12/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-12/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Potency&amp;rsquo; means
  A source of movement or change, which is in another thing than the thing moved or in the same thing qua other; e.g. the art of building is a potency which is not in the thing built, while the art of healing, which is a potency, may be in the man healed, but not in him qua healed. &amp;lsquo;Potency&amp;rsquo; then means the source, in general, of change or movement in another thing or in the same thing qua other, and also</description>

      <title>Defining Prior and Posterior</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-11/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-11/</guid>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;Prior&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;posterior&amp;rsquo; are applied:
 To some things (on the assumption that there is a first, i.e. a beginning, in each class) because they are nearer some beginning determined either absolutely and by nature, or by reference to something or in some place or by certain people;  e.g. things are prior in place because they are nearer either to some place determined by nature (e.g. the middle or the last place), or to some chance object; and that which is farther is posterior.</description>

      <title>Defining Quantum and Quality</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-13/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-13/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Quantum&amp;rsquo; means that which is divisible into two or more constituent parts of which each is by nature a &amp;lsquo;one&amp;rsquo; and a &amp;rsquo;this&amp;rsquo;.
A quantum is a plurality if it is numerable, a magnitude if it is a measurable.
&amp;lsquo;Plurality&amp;rsquo; means that which is divisible potentially into non-continuous parts.
&amp;lsquo;magnitude&amp;rsquo; that which is divisible into continuous parts; of magnitude, that which is continuous in one dimension is length; in two breadth, in three depth.</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-15/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Things are &amp;lsquo;relative&amp;rsquo;
 as double to half, and treble to a third, and in general that which contains something else many times to that which is contained many times in something else, and that which exceeds to that which is exceeded; as that which can heat to that which can be heated, and that which can cut to that which can be cut, and in general the active to the passive as the measurable to the measure, and the knowable to knowledge, and the perceptible to perception.</description>

      <title>Defining Substance, same, opposite</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-08/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-08/</guid>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;Substances&amp;rsquo; are
  the simple bodies, i.e. earth and fire and water and everything of the sort, and in general bodies and the things composed of them, both animals and divine beings, and the parts of these. All these are called substance because they are not predicated of a subject but everything else is predicated of them.-
  That which, being present in such things as are not predicated of a subject, is the cause of their being, as the soul is of the being of an animal.</description>

      <title>Defintion of Beginning</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-01/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-01/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;BEGINNING&amp;rsquo; means:
  that part of a thing from which one would start first, e.g a line or a road has a beginning in either of the contrary directions.
  That from which each thing would best be originated, e.g. even in learning we must sometimes begin not from the first point and the beginning of the subject, but from the point from which we should learn most easily.</description>

      <title>Element and Nature</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-03/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/research/aristotle/metaphysics/book-5/part-03/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;Element&amp;rsquo; means:
 the primary component immanent in a thing, and indivisible in kind into other kinds; e.g. the elements of speech are the parts of which speech consists and into which it is ultimately divided, while they are no longer divided into other forms of speech different in kind from them.  If they are divided, their parts are of the same kind, as a part of water is water (while a part of the syllable is not a syllable).</description>
