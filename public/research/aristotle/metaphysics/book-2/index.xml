      <description>There is a first principle. The causes of things are neither an infinite series nor infinitely various in kind.
For neither can one thing proceed from another, as from matter, ad infinitum (e.g. flesh from earth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on without stopping), nor can the sources of movement form an endless series (man for instance being acted on by air, air by the sun, the sun by Strife, and so on without limit).</description>

      <description>THE investigation of the truth is in one way hard, in another easy.
No one is able to attain the truth adequately. On the other hand, we do not collectively fail. But everyone says something true about the nature of things.
While individually we contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable amount is amassed.
Therefore, since the truth seems to be like the proverbial door, which no one can fail to hit, in this respect it must be easy, but the fact that we can have a whole truth and not the particular part we aim at shows the difficulty of it.</description>
