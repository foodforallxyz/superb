      <description>Fear-based ideas Such as Hell Should Be Removed Socrates Such are our principles of theology. Some tales should be told, others should not be told to our disciples from their youth upwards, if we value friendship and mean them to honour the gods and their parents.
But if they are courageous, they must learn other lessons, like those that will remove the fear of death. A man can be fearless of death if he does not believe that the world below is real and terrible.</description>

      <description>Sad Music Should not be Promoted by the State Socrates A song or ode has three parts:
There is no difference between words set to music and those not set to music. Both will conform to the same laws. The melody and rhythm will depend on the words. We had no need of lamentation. The harmonies which express sorrow are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the full-toned or bass Lydian, and those similar.</description>

      <description>Food and Medicine are Connected Glaucon What about their food?  Socrates The men are training for the great contest of all. I am afraid that their bodily habits are rather perilous to health. These athletes:
 sleep away their lives, and are liable to the most dangerous illnesses if they depart from their customary regimen.  A finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes, who are:</description>

      <description>Socrates The young men whom we before called &amp;lsquo;guardians&amp;rsquo; may be more properly designated as the rulers&amp;rsquo; auxiliaries and supporters.
An old Phoenician tale told of a useful lie. It said that the earth is our mother where we were manufactured in, and from it we were sent up. We should communicate this useful lie gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and lastly to the people. We will tell them that:</description>

But I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t there be good physicians in a State who will treat the people, both healthy and unhealthy?  Socrates The best judges know all sorts of moral natures.
