                        <p>Those are the reasons why humans should be free to:</p>
<ul>
<li>form opinions</li>
<li>express their opinions without reserve</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But should humans be also free to act them out?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Actions should not be as free as opinions.</p>
<p>On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act.</p>
<p>There might be opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor</li>
<li>that private property is robbery</li>
</ul>




<span class="" style="color: red">
These opinions should be allowed to freely circulate through the press. But these can be punished when:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</span>

<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Acts without justifiable cause that do harm to others might come from <!-- raw HTML omitted --> the unfavourable sentiments*. These need the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> active interference of mankind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*Superphysics note: Mill promotes the free circulation of hurtful ideas not knowing that those hurtful ideas lead to hurtful actions that he is against. So in effect, he is promoting something that he doesn&rsquo;t like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the liberty of the individual must be limited. He must not make himself a nuisance to other people.</p>
<p>But this contradicts the rule of letting opinions be free.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The imperfection of mankind leads to the need for different opinions. This means that there should be different experiments of living. 



<span class="" style="color: red">Free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others. The worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to try them.*</span>

</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="individuality">Individuality</h2>
<p>Individuality should assert itself in things which do not primarily concern others.</p>
<p>This individuality will add happiness when the traditions or customs are insufficient in providing it. This happiness will lead to social progress.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The greatest difficulty with this principle is the indifference of persons to the end itself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Liberty would not be undervalued if individuality were enshrined as one of the leading essentials of well-being. 



<span class="" style="color: red">It would make the adjustment of the boundaries between individuality and social control easier*.</span>

<h3 id="spontaniety">Spontaniety</h3>
<p>But the evil is that individual spontaneity is not seen as having any value. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The majority are satisfied with the ways as they now are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Spontaneity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reformers. It is is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and rebellious obstruction to what would be best for mankind.</p>

<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt of Germany was an eminent as a savant and a politician. He wrote that:</p>
<p>



<div class="squote  " data-sal="slide-right">
  
"the goal of man is to develop his powers to a complete and consistent whole in the highest and most harmonious way. Thus everyone must focus on the individuality of power and development. Freedom and a a variety of situations are needed for this, which will then lead to individual vigour and manifold diversity which combine themselves in "originality"

</div>

<p>Few people know Von Humboldt&rsquo;s doctrine. Few put so high a value to individuality.</p>
<p>Excellence cannot be achieved by doing absolutely nothing but copying one another. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>On the other hand, it would be absurd if people neglected the knowledge of others. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> However, humans should <!-- raw HTML omitted --> use and interpret experience in his own way upon reaching maturity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The traditions and customs of other people are based on their own experience. But this has problems: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have interpreted it rightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuitable to him.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Customs are made for customary circumstances, and customary characters. His circumstances or his character might be uncustomary.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Conform to good customs might not educate or develop his individuality</li>
</ol>
<p>The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and moral preference, are exercised only by making choices.</p>
<p>When you follow a custom, you make no choice. You do not practice discernment. The mental and moral, like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What men do and how they do it are important. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If houses were built, corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and prayers said by machines, then humans will be starved of human development.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it. Instead, it is a tree which requires development on all sides<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>An understanding of customs is better than a blind belief in custom.</p>
<p>People should exercise their understandings. An intelligent following of custom, or even occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than a blind mechanical adhesion to it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>People do not readily admit that their desires and impulses are their own. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yet a perfect human being also has desires and impulses just as he has beliefs and restraints. Strong impulses are only perilous when not properly balanced, <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is not because men&rsquo;s desires are strong that they act bad. Iit is because their consciences are weak.</p>




<span class="" style="color: red">There is no natural connection between strong impulses and a weak conscience.  The natural connection is the other way.*</span>

<blockquote>
<p>*Superphysics Note: Here, Mill shows his ignorance of the concept of the ego being the effect of the Negative Force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Person A&rsquo;s feelings are stronger and more various than those of Person B. He:</p>
<ul>
<li>has more of the raw material of human nature</li>
<li>is capable of more evil or more good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strong impulses are but another name for energy.</p>
<p>Energy may be turned to bad uses. But more good may always be made of an energetic nature, than of an indolent one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The same energy which makes personal impulses vivid and powerful, are also the source of virtue and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> self-control.</p>
<p>It is through the cultivation of this personal power that society both does its duty and protects its interests: not by rejecting the stuff of which heroes are made, because it knows not how to make them.</p>
<p>A person has character if his desires and impulses are his own&ndash; the expression of his own nature. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One whose desires and impulses are not his own, has no character. He is like a steam-engine that has a character. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Those who reject the encouragement of individuality of desires and impulses imply that society has no need of strong natures. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>In some early states of society, these strong forces might were too much ahead of the governors of society. Spontaneity and individuality was then in excess. The social principle had a hard struggle with it.</p>
<p>The difficulty then was, to induce men of strong bodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them to control their impulses.</p>
<p>To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline, like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power over the whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control his character—which society had not found any other sufficient means of binding.</p>




<span class="" style="color: red">But society has now fairly got the better of individuality. Its danger on human nature is the deficiency of personal impulses, not the excess.</span>

<p>In our times, everyone lives as under the eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The people do not ask themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do I prefer?</li>
<li>what would suit my character and disposition?</li>
<li>what would allow the best in me to have fair-play and enable it to grow and thrive?</li>
</ul>
<p>They ask themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is suitable to my position?</li>
<li>what is usually done by persons of my station and pecuniary circumstances?</li>
<li>(worse still) what is usually done by persons of circumstances superior to mine?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not mean that they choose custom over their own inclination. I mean that it does not occur to them to incline beyond what is customary.</p>
<p>Thus, the mind itself is bowed to the yoke. Even when people seek pleasure, they think of conformity first.</p>
<p>They:</p>
<ul>
<li>live in crowds</li>
<li>exercise choice only among things commonly done</li>
</ul>
<p>Peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct are shunned with crimes until by dint of not following their own nature, they have no nature to follow their human capacities are withered and starved.</p>
<p>They become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and are generally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or properly their own.</p>
<p>According to the Calvinistic theory, this is desirable. It views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-will as a great offence of man</li>
<li>Obedience as the best</li>
<li>people having no choice</li>
</ul>
<p>You must do. Whatever is not a duty, is a sin</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Human nature being radically corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature is killed within him. To one holding this theory of life, crushing out any of the human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no evil= man needs no capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the will of God= and if he uses any of his faculties for any other purpose but to do that supposed will more effectually, he is better without them.</p>
<p>That is the theory of Calvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated form, by many who do not consider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation consisting in giving a less ascetic interpretation to the alleged will of God; asserting it to be his will that mankind should gratify some of their inclinations; of course not in the manner they themselves prefer, but in the way of obedience, that is, in a way prescribed to them by authority; and, therefore, by the necessary conditions of the case, the same for all.</p>
<p>In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type of human character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerely think that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed, are as their Maker designed them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a much finer thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of animals, than as nature made them.</p>
<p>But if it be any part of religion to believe that man was made by a good being, it is more consistent with that faith to believe, that this Being gave all human faculties that they might be cultivated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takes delight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal conception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities of comprehension, of action, or of enjoyment.</p>
<p>There is a different type of human excellence from the Calvinistic; a conception of humanity as having its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to be abnegated. &ldquo;Pagan self-assertion&rdquo; is one of the elements of human worth, as well as &ldquo;Christian self-denial.&quot;[12] There is a Greek ideal of self-development, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of self-government blends with, but does not supersede. It may be better to be a John Knox than an Alcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles than either; nor would a Pericles, if we had one in these days, be without anything good which belonged to John Knox.</p>
<p>It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partake the character of those who do them, by the same process human life also becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant aliment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitely better worth belonging to. In proportion to the development of his individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is therefore capable of being more valuable to others. There is a greater fulness of life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the units there is more in the mass which is composed of them.</p>
<p>As much compression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of human nature from encroaching on the rights of others, cannot be dispensed with; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of view of human development. The means of development which the individual loses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of other people.</p>
<p>Even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better development of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the restraint put upon the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities which have the good of others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable, except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the restraint. If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To give any fair-play to the nature of each, it is essential that different persons should be allowed to lead[Pg 119] different lives. In proportion as this latitude has been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity. Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as Individuality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, by whatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforcing the will of God or the injunctions of men.</p>
<p>Having said that Individuality is the same thing with development, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument= for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good, than that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations will not suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that these developed human beings are of some use to the undeveloped—to point out to those who do not desire liberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in some intelligible manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of it without hindrance.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might possibly learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that originality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what were once truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, and set the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sense in human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does not believe that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways and practices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being rendered by everybody alike= there are but few persons, in comparison with the whole of mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely to be any improvement on established practice. But these few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already existed. If there were nothing new to be done, would human intellect cease to be necessary?</p>
<p>Would it be a reason why those who do the old things should forget why they are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings? There is only too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerate into the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whose ever-recurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and practices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would not resist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and there would be no reason why civilisation should not die out, as in the Byzantine Empire. Persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be, a small minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to preserve the soil in which they grow. Genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom. Persons of genius are, ex vi termini, more individual than any other people—less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing[Pg 122] them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning as &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; &ldquo;erratic,&rdquo; and the like; much as if one should complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a Dutch canal.</p>
<p>I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the necessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in practice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory, but knowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally indifferent to it. People think genius a fine thing if it enables a man to write an exciting poem, or paint a picture. But in its true sense, that of originality in thought and action, though no one says that it is not a thing to be admired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do very well without it. Unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at.</p>
<p>Originality is the one thing which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use of. They cannot see what it is to do for them= how should they? If they could see what it would do for them, it would not be originality. The first service which originality has to render them, is that of opening their eyes= which being once fully done, they would have a chance of being themselves original. Meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever yet done which some one[Pg 123] was not the first to do, and that all good things which exist are the fruits of originality, let them be modest enough to believe that there is something still left for it to accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more in need of originality, the less they are conscious of the want.</p>
<p>In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind. In ancient history, in the middle ages, and in a diminishing degree through the long transition from feudality to the present time, the individual was a power in himself; and if he had either great talents or a high social position, he was a considerable power. At present individuals are lost in the crowd. In politics it is almost a triviality to say that public opinion now rules the world. The only power deserving the name is that of masses, and of governments while they make themselves the organ of the tendencies and instincts of masses. This is as true in the moral and social relations of private life as in public transactions. Those whose opinions go by the name of public opinion, are not always the same sort of public= in[Pg 124] America they are the whole white population; in England, chiefly the middle class. But they are always a mass, that is to say, collective mediocrity.</p>
<p>And what is a still greater novelty, the mass do not now take their opinions from dignitaries in Church or State, from ostensible leaders, or from books. Their thinking is done for them by men much like themselves, addressing them or speaking in their name, on the spur of the moment, through the newspapers. I am not complaining of all this. I do not assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the present low state of the human mind. But that does not hinder the government of mediocrity from being mediocre government. No government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy, either in its political acts or in the opinions, qualities, and tone of mind which it fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign Many have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they always have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few.</p>
<p>The initiation of all wise or noble things, comes and must come from individuals; generally at first from some one individual. The honour and glory of the average man is that he is capable of following that initiative; that he can[Pg 125] respond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to them with his eyes open. I am not countenancing the sort of &ldquo;hero-worship&rdquo; which applauds the strong man of genius for forcibly seizing on the government of the world and making it do his bidding in spite of itself. All he can claim is, freedom to point out the way. The power of compelling others into it, is not only inconsistent with the freedom and development of all the rest, but corrupting to the strong man himself.</p>
<p>It does seem, however, that when the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or becoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that tendency would be, the more and more pronounced individuality of those who stand on the higher eminences of thought. It is in these circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals, instead of being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differently from the mass. In other times there was no advantage in their doing so, unless they acted not only differently, but better. In this age the mere example of nonconformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom, is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break through that tyranny,[Pg 126] that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained. That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.</p>
<p>I have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of these are fit to be converted into customs. But independence of action, and disregard of custom are not solely deserving of encouragement for the chance they afford that better modes of action, and customs more worthy of general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of decided mental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives in their own way. There is no reason that all human existences should be constructed on some one, or some small number of patterns. If a person possesses any tolerable amount of common-sense and experience, his own mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is the best in itself, but because it is his own mode.</p>
<p>Human beings are not like sheep; and even sheep are not[Pg 127] undistinguishably alike. A man cannot get a coat or a pair of boots to fit him, unless they are either made to his measure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from= and is it easier to fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like one another in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in the shape of their feet? If it were only that people have diversities of taste, that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after one model. But different persons also require different conditions for their spiritual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral, than all the variety of plants can in the same physical, atmosphere and climate.</p>
<p>The same things which are helps to one person towards the cultivation of his higher nature, are hindrances to another. The same mode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his faculties of action and enjoyment in their best order, while to another it is a distracting burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal life. Such are the differences among human beings in their sources of pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain[Pg 128] their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable. Why then should tolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only to tastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude of their adherents? Nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame, either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athletic exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be put down.</p>
<p>But the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused either of doing &ldquo;what nobody does,&rdquo; or of not doing &ldquo;what everybody does,&rdquo; is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had committed some grave moral delinquency. Persons require to possess a title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like without detriment to their estimation. To indulge somewhat, I repeat= for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of something worse than disparaging speeches—they are in peril of a commission de lunatico, and of having their[Pg 129] property taken from them and given to their relations.[13]</p>
<p>There is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion, peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration of individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderate in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations= they have no tastes or wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon. Now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to suppose that a strong movement has set in[Pg 130] towards the improvement of morals, and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movement has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our fellow-creatures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved standard. And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing strongly. Its ideal of character is to be without any marked character; to maim by compression,[Pg 131] like a Chinese lady&rsquo;s foot, every part of human nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity.</p>
<p>As is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is desirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferior imitation of the other half. Instead of great energies guided by vigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by a conscientious will, its result is weak feelings and weak energies, which therefore can be kept in outward conformity to rule without any strength either of will or of reason. Already energetic characters on any large scale are becoming merely traditional. There is now scarcely any outlet for energy in this country except business. The energy expended in that may still be regarded as considerable. What little is left from that employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing of small dimensions. The greatness of England is now all collective= individually small, we only appear capable of anything great by our habit of combining; and with this our moral and religious philanthropists are perfectly contented. But it was men of[Pg 132] another stamp than this that made England what it has been; and men of another stamp will be needed to prevent its decline.</p>
<p>The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at something better than customary, which is called, according to circumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or improvement. The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement; but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are as many possible independent centres of improvement as there are individuals.</p>
<p>The progressive principle, however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or of improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of Custom, involving at least emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes the chief interest of the history of mankind. The greater part of the world has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism of Custom is complete. This is the case over the whole East.</p>
<p>Custom is there, in all things, the final appeal; justice and right mean conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting. And we see the result. Those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life; they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and most powerful nations in the world. What are they now? The subjects or dependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom custom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress. A people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and then stop= when does it stop? When it ceases to possess individuality.</p>
<p>If a similar change should befall the nations of Europe, it will not be in exactly the same shape= the despotism of custom with which these nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. It proscribes singularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change together. We have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every one must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change once or twice a year. We thus take care that when there[Pg 134] is change, it shall be for change&rsquo;s sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience; for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at another moment.</p>
<p>But we are progressive as well as changeable= we continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them until they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvement in politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our idea of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to be as good as ourselves. It is not progress that we object to; on the contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people who ever lived. It is individuality that we war against= we should think we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that the unlikeness of one person to another is generally the first thing which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type, and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the advantages of both, of producing something better than either.</p>
<p>We have a warning example in China—a nation of much talent, and, in some respects, even wisdom, owing to the rare good fortune of having been[Pg 135] provided at an early period with a particularly good set of customs, the work, in some measure, of men to whom even the most enlightened European must accord, under certain limitations, the title of sages and philosophers. They are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the best wisdom they possess upon every mind in the community, and securing that those who have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of honour and power.</p>
<p>Surely, the people who did this have discovered the secret of human progressiveness. They kept themselves steadily at the head of the movement of the world. On the contrary, they have become stationary—have remained so for thousands of years; if they are ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners. They have succeeded beyond all hope in what English philanthropists are so industriously working at—in making a people all alike, all governing their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims and rules; and these are the fruits. The modern régime of public opinion is, in an unorganised form, what the Chinese educational and political systems are in an organised; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding[Pg 136] its noble antecedents and its professed Christianity, will tend to become another China.</p>
<p>What is it that has hitherto preserved Europe from this lot? What has made the European family of nations an improving, instead of a stationary portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them, which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but their remarkable diversity of character and culture.</p>
<p>Individuals, classes, nations, have been extremely unlike one another= they have struck out a great variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and although at every period those who travelled in different paths have been intolerant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellent thing if all the rest could have been compelled to travel his road, their attempts to thwart each other&rsquo;s development have rarely had any permanent success, and each has in time endured to receive the good which the others have offered. Europe is, in my judgment, wholly indebted to this plurality of paths for its progressive and many-sided development. But it already begins to possess this benefit in a considerably less degree.</p>
<p>It is decidedly advancing towards the Chinese ideal of making all people alike. M. de Tocqueville, in his last important work, remarks how much more the Frenchmen of the present day resemble one another, than did those even of the last generation. The same remark might be made of Englishmen in a far greater degree. In a passage already quoted from Wilhelm von Humboldt, he points out two things as necessary conditions of human development, because necessary to render people unlike one another; namely, freedom, and variety of situations. The second of these two conditions is in this country every day diminishing.</p>
<p>The circumstances which surround different classes and individuals, and shape their characters, are daily becoming more assimilated. Formerly, different ranks, different neighbourhoods, different trades and professions, lived in what might be called different worlds; at present, to a great degree in the same. Comparatively speaking, they now read the same things, listen to the same things, see the same things, go to the same places, have their hopes and fears directed to the same objects, have the same rights and liberties, and the same means of asserting them. Great as are the differences of position which remain, they are nothing to those which have ceased. And the assimilation is still proceeding.</p>
<p>All the political changes of the age promote it, since they all tend to raise the low and to lower the high.
Every extension of education promotes it, because education brings people under common influences, and gives them access to the general stock of facts and sentiments. Improvements in the means of communication promote it, by bringing the inhabitants of distant places into personal contact, and keeping up a rapid flow of changes of residence between one place and another. The increase of commerce and manufactures promotes it, by diffusing more widely the advantages of easy circumstances, and opening all objects of ambition, even the highest, to general competition, whereby the desire of rising becomes no longer the character of a particular class, but of all classes.</p>
<p>A more powerful agency than even all these, in bringing about a general similarity among mankind, is the complete establishment, in this and other free countries, of the ascendency of public opinion in the State. As the various social eminences which enabled persons entrenched on them to disregard the opinion of the multitude, gradually become levelled; as the very idea of resisting the will of the public, when it is positively known that they have a will, disappears more and more from the minds of practical politicians; there ceases to be any social support for non-conformity—any [Pg 139]substantive power in society, which, itself opposed to the ascendency of numbers, is interested in taking under its protection opinions and tendencies at variance with those of the public.</p>
<p>The combination of all these causes forms so great a mass of influences hostile to Individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can stand its ground. It will do so with increasing difficulty, unless the intelligent part of the public can be made to feel its value—to see that it is good there should be differences, even though not for the better, even though, as it may appear to them, some should be for the worse. If the claims of Individuality are ever to be asserted, the time is now, while much is still wanting to complete the enforced assimilation. It is only in the earlier stages that any stand can be successfully made against the encroachment.</p>
<p>The demand that all other people shall resemble ourselves, grows by what it feeds on. If resistance waits till life is reduced nearly to one uniform type, all deviations from that type will come to be considered impious, immoral, even monstrous and contrary to nature. Mankind speedily become unable to conceive diversity, when they have been for some time unaccustomed to see it.</p>

<p>[13] There is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort of evidence on which, of late years, any person can be judicially declared unfit for the management of his affairs; and after his death, his disposal of his property can be set aside, if there is enough of it to pay the expenses of litigation—which are charged on the property itself. All the minute details of his daily life are pried into, and whatever is found which, seen through the medium of the perceiving and describing faculties of the lowest of the low, bears an appearance unlike absolute commonplace, is laid before the jury as evidence of insanity, and often with success; the jurors being little, if at all, less vulgar and ignorant than the witnesses; while the judges, with that extraordinary want of knowledge of human nature and life which continually astonishes us in English lawyers, often help to mislead them. These trials speak volumes as to the state of feeling and opinion among the vulgar with regard to human liberty. So far from setting any value on individuality—so far from respecting the rights of each individual to act, in things indifferent, as seems good to his own judgment and inclinations, judges and juries cannot even conceive that a person in a state of sanity can desire such freedom. In former days, when it was proposed to burn atheists, charitable people used to suggest putting them in a madhouse instead= it would be nothing surprising nowadays were we to see this done, and the doers applauding themselves, because, instead of persecuting for religion, they had adopted so humane and Christian a mode of treating these unfortunates, not without a silent satisfaction at their having thereby obtained their deserts.</p>
