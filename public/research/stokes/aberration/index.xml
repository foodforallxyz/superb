      <description>The explanation of the aberration is so simple.
It uses the startling hypothesis that the luminiferous æther passes freely through the sides of the telescope and through the earth itself.
The planets carry a portion of the æther with them so that the æther, close to their surfaces, is at rest relatively on those surfaces. Its velocity changes as we recede ​from the surface, till, at no great distance, it is at rest in space.</description>
