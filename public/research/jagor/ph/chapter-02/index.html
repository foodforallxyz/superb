                        <p>The Manila custom-house requires many formalities which the native minor officials exercised without  discretion. This is:</p>
<ul>
<li>different from the easy routine of the English free ports in Asia which I had just came from</li>
<li>wearisome to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>A respectable merchant obtained for me a guarantee, as a particular favour, to have permission to disembark after a detention of 16 hours.</p>
<p>But even then, I was not allowed to take the smallest article of luggage on shore with me. During the south-west monsoon and the stormy season that accompanies the change of monsoons, the roadstead is unsafe.</p>
<p>Vessels are then obliged to shelter in the port of Cavite, 7 miles away.</p>
<ul>
<li>But during the north-east monsoons they can safely anchor half a league from the coast.</li>
</ul>
<p>All ships under 300 tons burden pass the breakwater and enter the Pasig. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The few ships in the roadstead, particularly of those of foreign countries, was the more remarkable, as Manila was the only port in the Philippines that had any commerce with foreign countries.</p>
<p>Since 1855, foreign trade could be done at 4 ports.</p>
<ul>
<li>But at during my arrival in March 1859, none of them had accepted a foreign ship.</li>
<li>It was a few weeks after my visit that the first English ship sailed into Iloilo to take in a cargo of sugar for Australia.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1868, 112 foreign vessels entered the port of Manila:</p>
<ul>
<li>The foreign shipes totaled 74,054 tons. Nearly all entered empty, but <!-- raw HTML omitted --> left with cargoes</li>
<li>The Spanish ships totaled 26,762 tons. These came and left with cargo. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>The opening of Iloilo was so advantageous, as explained in Chapter . <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This is because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the feeble development of agriculture, despite the unexampled soil fertility</li>
<li>chiefly the antiquated and artificially limited conditions of trade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="former-customs-duties">FORMER CUSTOMS DUTIES</h2>
<p>The customs duties were not very high at:</p>
<ul>
<li>7% on merchandise carried by Spanish ships</li>
<li>about twice for foreign ships.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spanish products have a duty of:</p>
<ul>
<li>3% if carried in Spanish ships</li>
<li>? if in foreign ships. These were only allowed to enter the port <!-- raw HTML omitted --> empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Philippine imports were from England which entered in 2 ways: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These were kept back until they could be sent in Spanish ships which charged nearly a triple freight (from £4 to £5 instead of from £1 to £2 per ton). These ships went to British ports rarely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goods were sent to Singapore and Hongkong where they were reshipped under the Spanish flag.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tonnage dues were levied on:</p>
<ul>
<li>empty ships<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>ships that touched at Manila without unloading or taking in fresh cargo</li>
</ul>
<p>If a ship<!-- raw HTML omitted --> landed even the smallest parcel, it was no longer rated as an empty ship<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but charged on the higher scale.</p>
<p>Vessels were therefore forced to enter the port either:</p>
<ul>
<li>entirely empty <!-- raw HTML omitted --> or</li>
<li>carrying sufficient to cover the expense of the increased harbour dues
<ul>
<li>This is almost impossibile for foreign ships because of the differential customs rates, which acted almost as a complete prohibition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This made ships enter empty. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Philippine exports were almost entirely limited to its raw produce, burdened with an export duty of 3%.</p>
<p>Exports leaving under the Spanish flag were only taxed at 1%. But there was scarcely any export trade with Spain, and as Spanish vessels, from their high rates of freight, were excluded from the carrying trade of the world, the boon to commerce was a delusive one.*</p>
<p>These eccentric excise laws, hampered with a hundred suspicious forms, frightened away the whole carrying trade from Manila. Its commission merchants were frequently unable to dispose of the local produce.</p>
<p>So trifling was the carrying trade that the total yearly average of the harbour dues, calculated from the returns of 10 years, barely reached 10,000 dollars.</p>
<p>The position of Manila, a central point between Japan, China, Annam, the English and Dutch ports of the Archipelago and Australia, is in itself extremely favourable to world trade.*</p>
<p>At the time of the north-eastern monsoons, during our winter, when vessels for the sake of a fair wind pass through the Straits of Gilolo on their way from the Indian Archipelago to China, they are obliged to pass close to Manila. They would find it a most convenient station, for the Philippines, as we have already mentioned, are particularly favourably placed for the west coast of America.</p>

<p>† Lapérouse said that Manila was perhaps the most fortunately situated city in the world.</p>
<p>An important decree was issued on April 5, 1869 which:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduced the differential duties and removed them after 2 years</li>
<li>abrogated all export duties</li>
<li>consolidated the more annoying port dues into one single charge</li>
</ul>
<p>It:</p>
<ul>
<li>would have appeared sooner had not the Spanish and colonial shipowners, spoilt by the protective system, opposed anything which touched their privileges</li>
<li>proves that the colonial ministry was aware of these circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Spaniards landed at the Philippines they found the inhabitants clad in silks and cotton stuffs, which were imported from China in exchange for:</p>
<ul>
<li>gold-dust</li>
<li>sapan wood*</li>
<li>holothurian</li>
<li>edible birds&rsquo; nests</li>
<li>skins.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is sent especially to China, where it is used for dyeing or printing in red. The stuff is first macerated with alum, and then for a finish dipped in a weak alcoholic solution of alkali. The reddish brown tint so frequently met with in the clothes of the poorer Chinese is produced from sapan.</p>

<h2 id="manilas-commerce">Manila&rsquo;s Commerce</h2>
<p>The Spanish created order in the Philippines. They opened commerce with America and indirectly with Europe. These greatly increased the island trade and extended it to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Manila was the great mart for the products of the East which loaded the galleons sailing from New Spain (at first to Navidad, after 1602 to Acapulco) as early as 1565, bringing back silver.*</p>
<p>The merchants in New Spain and Peru found this commerce so advantageous. It damaged the manufactured exports from Spain which were unable to compete with the Indian cottons and the Chinese silks.</p>
<p>The spoilt monopolists of Seville demanded therefore the abandonment of a colony which required considerable yearly contributions from the home exchequer, which stood in the way of the mother country&rsquo;s gains in her American settlements, and which forced his Catholic Majesty&rsquo;s silver to remain in the hands of the heathen.</p>
<p>Since the foundation of the colony they had continually thrown impediments in its path.</p>
<p>Their demands, however, were vain in face of the ambition of the throne and the influence of the clergy; but the public opinion of the time forced the Government to forbid the Peruvian and New Spanish merchants, in the interests of the mother country, to obtain merchandise from China, either directly, or through Manila.</p>
<p>The Filipinos were alone permitted to send Chinese goods to America, but only to the yearly value of $250,000. The return trade was limited to $500,000.*</p>
<p>Manila was first founded in 1571. But as early as 1565, Urdaneta, Legaspi&rsquo;s pilot, had found the route back through the Pacific Ocean while he was seeking a favourable north-west wind in the higher northern latitudes.</p>
<p>Urdaneta was not the first to use of the return passage. One of Legaspi&rsquo;s five vessels, under the command of Don Alonso de Arellano, which had on board as pilot one Lope Martin, a mulatto, separated itself from the fleet after they had reached the island, and returned to New Spain on a northern course, in order to claim the promised reward for the discovery.</p>
<p>Don Alonso was appointed, however, by the speedy return of Urdaneta.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kottenkamp I., 1594.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first amount was afterwards increased to $300,000 with a proportionate augmentation of the return freight. But the Spanish were forbidden to visit China, and were obliged to await the arrival of the junks.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1720, Chinese goods were entirely prohibited in the whole of the Spanish possessions in both hemispheres. A decree of 1754 (amplified in 1769) once more permitted trade with China, and increased the maximum value of the annual freightage to Acapulco to 500,000 silver dollars, and that of the return trade to twice the amount.</p>
<p>At last, the expense to the State put an end to the regular voyages to Acapulco (the last galleon left Manila in 1811, and the last departure from Acapulco took place in 1815). The commerce with America was carried on through merchant vessels, which were permitted in 1820 to export from the Philippines to the annual value of $750,000 and to trade with Acapulco, San Blas, Guyaquil, and Callao.</p>
<p>This concession, however, was not sufficient to compensate Philippine commerce for the injuries it suffered through the separation of Mexico from Spain.</p>
<p>The possession of Manila by the English in 1762 made its inhabitants acquainted with many industrial products which the imports from China and India were unable to offer them.</p>
<p>To satisfy these new cravings Spanish men-of-war were sent, towards the close of 1764, to the colony with articles of home manufacture, such as wine, provisions, hats, cloth, hardware, and ornamental objects.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-on-trade">RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE</h2>
<p>The Manila merchants, accustomed to a lucrative trade with Acapulco, strenuously resisted this innovation, although it was a considerable source of profit to them, for the Crown purchased the Indian and Chinese merchandise for its return freights from Manila at double their original value. In 1784, however, these men of war made their last trip.</p>
<ul>
<li>At first the maximum value of the imports only was limited, and the Manila merchants were not over scrupulous in making false statements as to their worth ; to put an end to these malpractices a limit was placed to the amount of silver exported. According to Mas, however, the silver illegally exported amounted to six or eight times the prescribed limit.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the English invasion, European vessels were forbidden to visit Manila ; but as that city was unable to do without Indian merchandise, and was forbidden to import it in its own ships, it was brought there in English and French bottoms, which assumed a Turkish name, and were provided with a sham Indian captain.</p>
<p>In 1785, the “Compania&quot; of the Philippines obtained a monopoly of the trade between Spain and the colony, but it was not allowed to interfere with the direct traffic between Acapulco and Manila. The desire was to acquire large quantities of colonial produce, silk, indigo, cinnamon, cotton, pepper, &amp;c., in order to export it; but as it was unable to obtain compulsory labour, it entirely failed in its attempted artificial development of agriculture.</p>
<p>The “Compania” suffered great losses through its erroneous system of operation, and the incapacity of its officials (it paid, for example, 13} dollars for pico pepper, which cost from 3 to 4 dollars in Sumatra).</p>
<p>In 1789, foreign ships were allowed to import Chinese and Indian produce, but none from Europe.</p>
<p>In 1809, an English commercial house obtained permission to establish itself in Manila. * In 1814, after the conclusion of the peace with France, the same permission, with greater or less restrictions, was granted to all foreigners.</p>
<p>In 1820, the direct trade between the Philippines and Spain was thrown open, without any limitations to the export of colonial produce, on the condition that the value of the Indian and Chinese goods in each expedition should not exceed</p>
<ul>
<li>Lapérouse mentions a French firm that, in 1787, bad been for many years established in Manila.</li>
</ul>
<p>50,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Ever since 1834, when the privileges of the “ Compania” expired, free trade has been permitted in Manila ; foreign ships, however, being charged double dues. Four new ports have been thrown open to general trade since 1855; and in 1869 the liberal tariff previously alluded to was issued.</p>
<p>After 3 centuries of Spanish rule, Manila has by no means added to the importance it possessed shortly after the advent of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The isolation of Japan and the IndoChinese empires, a direct consequence of the importunities and pretensions of the Catholic missionaries,* the secession of the colonies on the west coast of America, above all the long continuance of a distrustful commercial and colonial policy—a policy which exists even at the present day-while important markets, based on large capital and liberal principles, were being established in the most favoured spots of the British and Dutch Indies; all these circumstances have contributed to this result and thrown the Chinese trade into other channels.</p>
<p>The cause is as clear as the effect, yet it might be erroneous to ascribe the policy so long pursued to shortsightedness.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, in their schemes of colonisation, had partly a religious purpose in view, but the government discovered a great source of influence in the disposal of the extremely lucrative colonial appointments.</p>
<p>The crown itself, as well as its favourites, thought of nothing but extracting the most it could from the colony, and had neither the intention or the power to develop the natural wealth of the country by agriculture and commerce. Inseparable from this policy, was the persistent exclusion of foreigners.f It seemed even more necessary in the isolated Philippines than in America to cut off the VOYAGES OF THE GALLEONS.</p>
<ul>

Cocks to Thomas Wilson (calendar of State Papers, India, No. 823) &hellip;. “The English will obtain a trade in China, so they bring not in any padrese (as they term them), which the Chinese cannot abide to hear of, because heretofore they came in such swarms, and are always begging without shame.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As late as 1867 some old decrees, passed against the establishment of foreigners, were renewed. A royal ordinance of 1844 prohibits the admission of strangers into the interior of the colony under any pretext whatsoever.</li>
</ul>

<p>natives from all contact with foreigners, if the Spaniards had any desire to remain in undisturbed possession of the colony. In face, however, of the developed trade of to-day and the claims of the world to the productive powers of such an extraordinarily fruitful soil, the old restrictions can no longer be maintained, and the lately introduced liberal tariff must be hailed as a thoroughly well-timed measure.</p>
<p>The oft-mentioned voyages of the galleons betwixt Manila and Acapulco hold such a prominent position in the history of the Philippines, and afford such an interesting glimpse into the old colonial system, that their principal characteristics deserve some description.</p>
<p>In the days of Morga, towards the close of the 16th century, 30-40 Chinese junks visit Manila (generally in March) annually. Towards the end of June, a galleon used to sail for Acapulco.</p>
<p>The trade with the latter place, the active operations of which were limited to the three central months of the year, was so lucrative, easy, and certain, that the Spaniards scarcely cared to engage in any other undertakings.</p>
<p>As the carrying power of the annual galleon was by no means proportioned to the demand for cargo room, the Governor divided it as he deemed best; the favourites, however, to whom he assigned shares in the hold, seldom traded themselves, but parted with their concessions to the merchants. According to De Guignes,* the hold of the vessel was divided into 1,500 parts, of which the majority were allotted to the priests, and the rest to distinguished persons. As a matter of fact, the value of the cargo, which was officially limited to 600,000 dollars, was considerably higher. It chiefly consisted of Indian and Chinese cottons and silk stuffs (amongst others 50,000 pairs of silk stockings from</p>
<ul>
<li>Vide Pinkerton.</li>
</ul>
<p>China), and gold ornaments. The value of the return freight amounted to between two and three millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Everything in this trade was settled beforehand; the number, shape, size, and value of the bales, and even their selling price. As this was usually double the original cost, the permission to ship goods to a certain amount was equivalent, under ordinary circumstances, to the bestowal of a present of a like value.</p>
<p>These permissions or licences (boletas) were, at a later period, usually granted to pensioners and officers&rsquo; widows, and to officials, in lieu of an increase of salary; these favourites of fortune were forbidden however to make a direct use of them, for to trade with Acapulco was the sole right of those members of the Consulado (a kind of chamber of commerce) who could boast a long residence in the country and the possession of a capital of at least 8,000 dollars.</p>
<p>Legentil, the astronomer, gives a full description of the regulations which prevailed in his day and the manner in which they were disobeyed.</p>
<p>The cargo consisted of a thousand bales, each composed of four packets,* the maximum value of each packet being fixed at 250 dollars. It was impossible to add to the amount of bales, but they pretty generally consisted of more than four packets, and their value so far exceeded the prescribed limits, that a boleta was considered to be worth from 200 to 225 dollars.</p>
<p>The officials took good care that no goods should be smuggled on board without a boleta. These were in such demand, that, at a later period, Comynt had to pay 500 dollars for the right to ship goods, the value of which scarcely amounted to 1,000.</p>
<p>The merchants usually borrowed the money for these undertakings from the obras pias, pious endowments, which, up to our own time, fulfil in the islands the purposes of banks. In the early days of</p>
<ul>
<li>Each packet was 6X2}x1}=18.75 Span. cub. ft. St. Croix. + Vide Comyn&rsquo;s “ Comercio exterior.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The obras pias were pious legacies which usually stipulated that 2/3 of the trade, the galleon used to leave Cavite in July and sail with a north-westerly wind beyond the tropics, until it met with a west wind between the 30th and 40th parallel.*</p>
<p>Later on the vessels were ordered to leave Cavite with the first south-westerly wind, to sail along the south coast of Luzon, through the St. Bernardino straits, and to continue along the thirteenth parallel of north latitudet as far to the east as possible, until the northeasterly trade wind compelled them to seek a north-west breeze in higher latitudes. They were then obliged to try the 30th parallel as long as possible, instead of as formerly the thirtyseventh.</p>
<p>The captain of the galleon was not permitted to sail immediately northward, although to have done so would have procured him a much quicker and safer passage, and would have enabled him to reach the rainy zone more rapidly.</p>
<p>To effect the last, indeed, was a matter of the greatest importance to him, for his vessel, overladen with merchandise, had but little room left for water; and, although he had a crew of from 400 to 600 hands to provide for, he was instructed to depend upon the rain he caught on the voyage ; for which purpose, the galleon was provided with suitable mats and bamboo pails. their value should be advanced at interest for the furtherance of maritime commercial undertakings until the premiums, which for a voyage to Acapulo amounted to 50, to China 25, and to India 35 per cent., had increased the original capital to a certain amount.</p>
<p>The interest of the whole was then to be devoted to masses for the founders, or to other pious and benevolent purposes. A third was generally kept as a reserve fund to cover possible losses. The Government long since appropriated these reserve funds as compulsory loans,“ but they are still considered as existing.&quot;</p>
<p>When the trade with Acapulco came to an end, the principals could no longer be laid out according to the intentions of the founders, and they were lent out at interest in other ways. By a royal ordinance of the 3rd November, 1854, a junta was appointed to administer the property of the obras pias. The total capital of the five endowments (in reality only four, for one of them no longer possessed anything) amounted to nearly a million of dollars. The profits from the loans were distributed according to the amounts of the original capitals, which, however, no longer existed in cash, as the Government had disposed of them.</p>

</ul>
<p>Voyages in these low latitudes were, owing to the inconstancy of the winds, extremely troublesome, and often lasted five months and upwards. The fear of exposing the costly cumbrous vessel to the powerful and frequently stormy winds of the higher latitudes, appears to have been the cause of these sailing orders.</p>
<p>As soon as the galleon had passed the great Sargasso shoal, it took a southerly course, and touched at the southern point of the Californian peninsula (Saint Lucas), where news and provisions awaited it.*</p>
<p>In their earlier voyages, however, they must have sailed much further to the north, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cape Mendocino, and have been driven southward in sight of the coast ; for Vizcaino, in the voyage of discovery he undertook in 1603, from Mexico to California, found the principal mountains and capes, although no European had ever set his foot upon them, already christened by the galleons, to which they had served as landmarks.t</p>
<p>The return voyage to the Philippines was an easy one, and only occupied from forty to sixty days. The galleon left Acapulco in February or March, sailed southwards till it fell in with the trade wind (generally in from 10° to 11° of north latitude), which carried it easily to the Ladrone Islands, and thence reached Manila by way of Samar. §</p>
<p>A galleon was usually of from 1,200 to 1,500 tons burden, and carried fifty or sixty guns. The latter, however, were pretty generally banished to the hold during the eastward voyage. When the ship&rsquo;s bows were turned towards home, and there was no longer any press of space, the guns were remounted.</p>
<p>Fray Gaspar says of the Santa Anna, which Thomas Candish * Vide Anson.&quot; + Randolph&rsquo;s “ History of California.&quot;</p>
<p>In Morga&rsquo;s time the galleons took seventy days to the Ladrone islands, from ten to twelve from thence to Cape Espiritu Santo, and eight more to Manila.</p>
<p>I A very good description of these voyages may be found in the 10th chapter of Anson&rsquo;s work, which also contains a copy of a sea map, captured in the Cavadonga, displaying the proper track of the galleons to and from Acapulco.</p>
<p>captured and burnt in 1586 off the Californian coast : “Our people suiled so carelessly that they used their guns for ballast the pirate&rsquo;s venture was such a fortunate one that he returned to London with sails of Chinese damask and silken rigging.&quot;</p>
<p>The cargo was sold in Acapulco at a 100% profit and was paid for in silver, cochineal, quicksilver, etc.</p>
<p>The total value of the return freight was between 2-3 million dollars,* of which at least 0.25 million went to the king.</p>
<p>The return of a galleon to Manila, laden with silver dollars and new arrivals, was a great holiday for the colony. A con</p>
<p>gaming table, was soon spent by the crew; when matters returned to their usual lethargic state. It was no unfrequent event, however, for vessels to be lost. They were too often laden with a total disregard to seaworthiness, and wretchedly handled by officers who disobeyed their orders and set caution at defiance.</p>
<p>It was favour, not capacity, that determined the patronage of these lucrative appointments.†</p>
<p>Many galleons fell into the hands of English and Dutch cruisers. But these tremendous profits gradually decreased when the Compania obtained the right to import Indian cotton into New Spain by way of Vera Cruz, subject to a 6% customs duty  and when English and American adventurers began to smuggle these and other goods into the country.*</p>
<p>• De Guignes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The officer in command of the expedition, to whom the title of general was given, had always a captain under his orders, whose share in the gain of each trip amounted to 40,000 dollars. The pilot was content with 20,000. The first lieutenant (master) was entitled to 9 per cent. on the sale of the cargo, and pocketed from this and from the profits of his own private ventures upwards of 350,000 dollars. (Vide Arenas.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I The value of the cargoes Anson captured amounted to 1,313,000 dollars, besides 36,682 ounces of fine silver and cochineal. While England and Spain were at peace, Drake plundered the latter to the extent of at least one and a half million of dollars. Thomas Candish burnt the rich cargo of the Santa Anna, as he had no room for it on board his own vessel.</p>
<p>. For instance, in 1786 the San Andrés, which had a cargo on board valued at 2 million, found no market for it in Acapulco. The same thing happened in 1787 to the San José, and a second time in 1789 to the San Andrés.</p>
<p>Spanish dollars found their way to China and the further Indies through the galleons, where they circulate to this day.</p>
