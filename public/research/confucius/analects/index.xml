      <description>Confucius To learn, and then to practise opportunely what one has learned, brings satisfaction.
To have associates in study coming to one from distant gives means pleasure.
The superior order of men are those who still remain pleased even if they do not comprehend this.
 Scholar-Yu True people who are dutiful to their parents and elder brothers rarely turn currishly on their superiors. Such a desire not to commit that offence prevents anarchy or disorder.</description>

      <description>Confucius Let a ruler base his government upon virtuous principles, and he will be like the pole-star, which remains steadfast in its place, while all the host of stars turn towards it.
The &amp;lsquo;Book of Odes&amp;rsquo; has 300 pieces.
But one expression in it can cover the purport of all, namely unswerving mindfulness. The people will become evasive and devoid of any sense of shame if they are governed simply by statute, pains and penalties.</description>

      <description>Confucius alluded to the head of the Ki family, and the eight lines of posturers before their ancestral hall.
Confucius If the Ki can allow himself to go to this extent, to what extent will he not allow himself to go?
The Three Families were in the habit, during the Removal of the sacred vessels after sacrifice, of using the hymn commencing, Harmoniously the Princes draw near with reverent tread, assisting in his worship Heaven&amp;rsquo;s Son, the great and dread.</description>

      <description>Confucius It is social good feeling that gives charm to a neighborhood. And where is the wisdom of those who choose an abode where it does not abide?
&amp;ldquo;Those who are without it cannot abide long, either in straitened or in happy circumstances. Those who possess it find contentment in it. Those who are wise go after it as men go after gain. &amp;ldquo;Only they in whom it exists can have right likings and dislikings for others.</description>

      <description>The Master pronounced Kung-ye Ch&amp;rsquo;ang, a disciple, to be a marriageable person; for although lying bound in criminal fetters he had committed no crime. And he gave him his own daughter to wife.
Of Nan Yung, a disciple, he observed, that in a State where the government was well conducted he would not be passed over in its appointments, and in one where the government was ill conducted he would evade punishment and disgrace.</description>

      <description>The Master said of Yen Yung, a disciple= &amp;ldquo;Yung might indeed do for a prince!&amp;rdquo;
Yen Yung asked his opinion of a certain individual. The Master replied that he is passable, but impetuous.
yen But if a man habituate himself to a reverent regard for duty even while in his way of doing things he is impetuous in the oversight of the people committed to his charge, is he not passable?</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Confucius--An Incident</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/research/confucius/analects/chapter-7/</link>

      <description>Confucius= I am a transmitter and not an originator.
I believe in and loves the ancients. I compare myself with our old P&amp;rsquo;ang
I am a quiet brooder and memorizer; a student never satiated with learning; an unwearied monitor of others! &amp;ldquo;The things which weigh heavily upon my mind are these�failure to improve in the virtues, failure in discussion of what is learnt, inability to walk according to knowledge received as to what is right and just, inability also to reform what has been amiss.</description>

      <description>Confucius T&amp;rsquo;ai-pih might be pronounced a man of the highest moral excellence, for he allowed the empire to pass by him onwards to a third heir.  The people were ignorant of his motives and were unable to admire him for doing so. &amp;ldquo;Without the Proprieties, we have these results= for deferential demeanor, a worried one; for calm attentiveness, awkward bashfulness; for manly conduct, disorderliness; for straightforwardness, perversity. When men of rank show genuine care for those nearest to them in blood, the people rise to the duty of neighborliness and sociability.</description>

      <description>The Master rarely spoke on Advantage, Destiny, and Duty of man to man.
A man of the village of Tah-hiang exclaimed of him,
&amp;ldquo;A great man is Confucius!�a man of extensive learning, and yet in nothing has he quite made himself a name!&amp;rdquo;
The Master heard of this, and mentioning it to his disciples he said:
Confucius What then shall I take in hand? Shall I become a carriage driver, or an archer?</description>

      <description>Confucius The first to make progress in the Proprieties and in Music are plain farmers.
After them, the men of higher standing. If I had to employ any of them, I would choose the farmers.
Of those who were with me when I was in the Ch&amp;rsquo;in and Ts&amp;rsquo;ai States, not one now is left to approach my door.
As for Hwui, he is not one to help me on.</description>

      <description>The Chief of the Ki family was a wealthier man than the Duke of Chow had been, and yet Yen Yu gathered and hoarded for him, increasing his wealth more and more.
Confucius &amp;ldquo;He is no follower of mine. It would serve him right, my children, to sound the drum, and set upon him.&amp;rdquo;
As for the characteristics of the four disciples=
Tsz-ku was simple-minded;
Tsang Si, a dullard;
Tsz-chang, full of airs; Tsz-lu, rough, Hwi comes near to perfection, while frequently in great want.</description>

      <description>When he was in waiting, and at a meal with the prince, the prince would make the offering,and he (the Master) was the pregustator.
When sick and the prince came to see him, he would arrange his position so that his head inclined towards the east.
He would put over him his Court robes, and draw his girdle across them. When summoned by order of the prince, he would start off without waiting for his horses to be put to.</description>

      <description>Through the intervention of Tsz-lu, Tsz-kau was being appointed governor of Pi.
&amp;ldquo;You are spoiling a good man&amp;rsquo;s son,&amp;rdquo; said the Master.
Tsz-lu rejoined, &amp;ldquo;But he will have the people and their superiors to gain experience from, and there will be the altars; what need to read books?
He can become a student afterwards.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Here is the reason for my hatred of glib-tongued people,&amp;rdquo; said the Master.
 Tsz-lu, Tsang Sin, Yen Yu, and Kung-si Hwa were sitting near him.</description>

      <description>The Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder of Confucius In his own village, Confucius presented a simple appearance and looked unlike a man who could talk. But in the ancestral temple, and at Court, he spoke with the fluency and accuracy of a debater, but ever guardedly.
At Court, he would talk to the lower order of great officials.
 He spoke somewhat firmly and directly and spoke more affably with those of the higher order.</description>

      <description>Tsz-lu was asking about government.
Confucius Lead the way in it, work hard at it, and do not tire of it..  Chung-kung, on being made first minister to the Chief of the Ki family, consulted the Master about government.
Confucius to Chung-kung:
Confucius Let the heads of offices be heads. Excuse small faults. Promote men of sagacity and talent.  &amp;ldquo;But,&amp;rdquo; he asked, &amp;ldquo;how am I to know the sagacious and talented, before promoting them?</description>

      <description>Emperor Yau to Shun= Ah, upon you lies the Heaven-appointed order of succession!
Faithfully hold to it, without any deflection. For if within the four seas necessity and want befall the people, your own revenue will forever come to an end.
Shun also used the same language in handing down the appointment to Yu.
Emperor T&amp;rsquo;ang in his prayer= I, the child Li, presume to avail me of an ox of dusky hue, and presume to manifestly announce to God that to the transgressor I dare not grant forgiveness, nor yet keep in abeyance Thy ministers.</description>

      <description>The Chief of the Ki family was about to attack the Chuen-yu domain.
Yen Yu and Tsz-lu to Confucius= The Ki is about to have an affair with Chuen-yu.
Confucius Yen, you are at fault.
The Chief of Chuen-yu in the past was appointed lord of the East Mung (mountain). He lives in your own State. He is an official of the State-worship. How can you think of attacking him?</description>

      <description>Yuen Sz= What brings shame?
Confucius Confucius= &amp;ldquo;Pay,&amp;rdquo; said the Master; &amp;ldquo;pay ever looking to that, whether the country be well or badly governed.&amp;rdquo;  When imperiousness, boastfulness, resentments, and covetousness cease to prevail among the people, may it be considered that mutual good-will has been effected?
A hard thing overcome, it may be considered. But as to the mutual good-will I cannot tell.
Learned officials who hanker after a home life are not worthy of being caled learned.</description>

      <description>Confucius Confucius= In the reign of the last king of the Yin dynasty, there were three men of philanthropic spirit= the viscount of Wei, who withdrew from him; the viscount of Ki, who became his bondsman; and Pi-kan, who reproved him and suffered death.&amp;quot;  Hwi of Liu-hi was the Chief Criminal Judge and was thrice dismissed.
A person remarked to him, &amp;ldquo;Can you not yet bear to withdraw?&amp;rdquo; He replied, &amp;ldquo;If I act in a straightforward way in serving men, whither in these days should I go, where I should not be thrice dismissed?</description>

      <description>Yang Ho was desirous of having an interview with Confucius, but on the latter&amp;rsquo;s failing to go and see him, he sent a present of a pig to his house. Confucius went to return his acknowledgments for it at a time when he was not at home. They met, however, on the way.
He said to Confucius, &amp;ldquo;Come, I want a word with you. Can that man be said to have good-will towards his fellow-men who hugs and hides his own precious gifts and allows his country to go on in blind error?</description>

      <description>Confucius Confucius= Self-control, and a habit of falling back upon propriety, virtually effect it.
Let these conditions be fulfilled for one day, and every one round will betake himself to the duty. Is it to begin in one&amp;rsquo;s self, or think you, indeed! it is to begin in others?
 Confucius Without Propriety use not your eyes, ears, tongue, nor any limb of your body.  Confucius When you go forth from your door, be as if you were meeting some guest of importance.</description>

      <description>Duke Ling of Wei was consulting Confucius about army arrangements.
Confucius Had you asked me about such things as temple requisites, I have learnt that business, but I have not yet studied military matters.  He followed up this reply by leaving on the following day.
After this, during his residence in the State of Ch&amp;rsquo;in, his followers, owing to a stoppage of food supply, became so weak and ill that not one of them could stand.</description>

      <description>Tsz-chang= The learned official who when he sees danger ahead will risk his very life, who when he sees a chance of success is mindful of what is just and proper, who in his religious acts is mindful of the duty of reverence, and when in mourning thinks of his loss, is indeed a fit and proper person for his place.&amp;quot;
If a person hold to virtue but never advance in it, and if he have faith in right principles and do not build himself up in them, how can he be regarded either as having such, or as being without them?</description>
