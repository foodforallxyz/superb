      <description>61  For a long time, Scottish banks were very careful to require frequent and regular repayments from all their customers They did not deal with any person of any fortune or credit who did not make frequent and regular operations with them.
By this attention=
 they saved the extraordinary cost of replenishing their coffers they also gained two other very considerable advantages=     62  They could tolerably judge the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors.</description>

      <description>37  Frugality increases the public capital and prodigality reduces it.
Capitals neither increase nor decrease when revenues match expenses. Some modes of expence contribute more to the growth of public opulence than others.
 38  The person&amp;rsquo;s revenue may be spent in either=
 non-durable things which are consumed immediately, or  The revenue spent this way daily can neither alleviate nor support the next day&amp;rsquo;s expence.   durable things which can be accumulated.</description>

      <description>The Increase in Bank Notes does not increase inflation  95  A paper money made up of bank notes is equal in value to gold and silver money when it is:
 issued by people of undoubted credit, payable on demand without any condition, always readily paid as soon as presented, and equal in value to gold and silver, since gold and silver money can be had for it at any time.</description>

      <title>Banks Increase National Wealth by Mobilizing Dead Stock</title>

      <description>86  The judicious operations of banking can increase a country’s industry, not by augmenting the country’s capital, but by rendering most of that capital productive.
The money which a dealer keeps unemployed for answering occasional demands is dead stock. It produces nothing to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into=
 active and productive stock, materials to work on, tools to work with, provisions to work for, and stock which produces something to himself and his country.</description>

      <description>Cash Accounts  44  Scotland’s commerce is not very great at present. It was smaller when the first two banks were established. Those banks would have had little trade had they confined their business to discounting of bills of exchange.
They invented cash accounts &amp;ndash; another method of issuing their promissory notes.
 They give credit (£2,000-3,000 for example) to anyone who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good landed estate to become surety for him.</description>

      <description>79  The Bank of England is the biggest bank of circulation in Europe.
It was incorporated by a charter under the Great Seal on July 27, 1694. It then lent to government £1.2 million in exchange for an annuity of £100,000 composed of=
 £96,000 interest or 8% [1.2m * 0.08], and £4,000 annually for management expenses.  The Glorious Revolution established a new government which had a very low credit because it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest.</description>

      <description>18  The third division is the circulating capital.
It only affords a revenue by circulating or changing masters. It has four parts=
 19  1. The money which circulates and distributes the three other stocks to their proper consumers.
 20  2. The stock of food owned by the butcher, farmer, wheat-merchant, brewer, etc.
 21  3. The unfinished products (clothes, furniture, and building) which remain with the growers, manufacturers, drapers, timber merchants, carpenters and joiners, brick-makers, etc.</description>

      <description>37  When we compute the amount of industry which a society&amp;rsquo;s circulating capital can employ, we must account only the provisions, materials, and finished work.
The circulating capital which consists in money, and which only circulates those three, must always be deducted. Three things are needed to mobilize industry=
 materials to work on, tools to work with, and wages or recompense for the work done.  Money is neither a material to work on, nor a tool to work with.</description>

      <description>24  Wholesale trade is the buying and selling by wholesale.
It may be reduced to three kinds=
  The home-trade   This is the purchase of local produce in one part of a country to sell in another part of the same country. It includes the inland and the coasting trade.
 The foreign trade of consumption   This is the purchase of foreign goods for home-consumption.</description>

      <description>65  More than 25 years have passed since the paper money issued by the Scottish banks was more than fully equal to what the national circulation could easily absorb and employ.
Those banks gave more than all the assistance possible to Scottish traders and entrepreneurs.
The traders and entrepreneurs had overtraded a little.
 They brought themselves either a loss or a profit reduction  This always results from the smallest degree of overtrading.</description>

      <description>7  The monied interest naturally increases with the increase in the circulating capital in a country.  The increase of those capitals for lending naturally accompanies the increase of the capitals.  In other words, as stock increases, the amount of stock to be lent at interest gradually grows.
 8  As the capitals for lending increase, its interest diminishes in the same way that the market prices of goods diminish when their quantity increases.</description>

      <description>Bank Notes  27  There are many kinds of paper money.
The circulating notes of banks are the best known and best adapted as paper money.
 28  When people have such confidence in a banker, they believe that he is always ready to pay upon the presentation of his promissory notes.
Those notes become equal to gold and silver money from the confidence that money can be received for the notes at any time.</description>

      <description>99  In Yorkshire’s paper currencies, the payment of so small a sum as a sixpence required the note’s holder to bring the change of a guinea to the issuer.
This was very difficult for the holders of such notes. It must have degraded this currency below the value of gold and silver money. An Act of Parliament declared all such clauses unlawful. It suppressed, as in Scotland, all promissory notes payable to the bearer under 20 shillings value.</description>

      <description>14  The machines and tools which make up the fixed capital of an individual or a society are not included in their gross or net revenue.
The money which circulates the society&amp;rsquo;s revenue among its members is also not included in that revenue.
 The great wheel of circulation is different from the goods which are circulated through it. The society&amp;rsquo;s revenue is in those goods, not in the wheel that circulates them.</description>

      <description>1  Book 1 showed that the price of commodities is made up of rent, wages, and profit.
 There are some commodities which has a price made up of wages and profits only. There are very few in which it consists in wages only.  The price of every commodity resolves itself into some one, or other, or all of these three parts. If it goes neither to rent nor wages, then it goes to somebody&amp;rsquo;s profit.</description>

      <description>Production vs Services  1  Productive labour adds value while unproductive labour does not. The labour of a manufacturer adds to=
 the value of the materials which he works on, the value of his own maintenance, and the value of his master&amp;rsquo;s profit.  On the contrary, the labour of a menial servant adds to the value of nothing.
The manufacturing worker costs nothing to his employer even though the employer pays his wages.</description>

      <description>1  The stock lent at interest is always considered as a capital by its lender.
He expects that:
 it will be restored to him in due time the borrower will pay him a rent for using it  The borrower may use it as a capital or as a stock for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he employs it to maintain productive labourers.</description>

      <description>73  In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established in Scotland to relieve the country&amp;rsquo;s distress.
The design was generous but the execution was imprudent. It did not understand the nature and causes of the distress it meant to relieve.
Compared to any other bank, it was more liberal in:
 in granting cash accounts and in discounting bills of exchange  It discounted all bills equally, including real and circulating bills.</description>

      <description>30  The capital employed in the carrying trade is diverted from supporting its productive labour to support that of foreign countries. It may replace the capitals of foreign countries.
The Dutch merchant who sends the Polish wheat to Portugal and returns Portuguese fruits &amp;amp; wines to Poland, replaces the capitals of Poland and Portugal.
 Neither of those two capitals supported the productive labour of Holland. One of the capitals supports the productive labour of Poland The other one supports that of Portugal.</description>

      <description>49  A bank&amp;rsquo;s common expenses are:
 the cost of house-rent wages of servants, clerks, accountants, etc.  It also spends to keep a large amount at all times in its coffers for answering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes.
 This amount pays no interest. The expence of replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied when answering those occasional demands.   50  Let us say that:</description>

      <title>The Four Employment of capitals</title>

      <description>1  The destiny of all capitals is to maintain productive labour.
But the amount of that labour varies extremely according to=
 the diversity of their employment and the value it adds to the national annual produce.   2  A capital may be employed in four ways=
 In procuring the rude produce required for society&amp;rsquo;s use and consumption   Examples are the capitals used in improving or cultivating lands, mines, or fisheries  In manufacturing and preparing that rude produce for immediate use and consumption   Examples are the capitals of all master manufacturers  In transporting the rude or manufactured produce from where they abound to where they are wanted   Examples are the capitals of all wholesale merchants  In dividing portions of rude or manufactured produce into small parcels for those who want them.</description>

      <description>13  The proportion between industry and idleness is regulated by the proportion between capital and revenue.
 Wherever capital predominates, industry prevails. Wherever revenue, idleness.  Therefore, every increase or reduction of capital naturally increases or reduce the real amount of industry.
Capital affects the number of productive hands. The number of productive hands affects the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabitants.
 14  Capitals are increased by parsimony and decreased by prodigality and misconduct.</description>

      <description>78  John Law thought that Scotland&amp;rsquo;s industry languished for the lack of money to employ it. He proposed to remedy this lack by establishing a bank which would issue paper based on the whole value of all the lands in the country.
The Parliament of Scotland rejected his proposal. The Duke of Orleans (Regent of France) adopted it with some variations.
The idea of multiplying paper to almost any extent was the real foundation of the Mississippi scheme.</description>

      <description>The Origin of the Propensity to Save  28  Regarding profusion, The passion for present enjoyment is the principle which prompts us to spend.
 It is sometimes violent and very difficult to restrain, leading to wastefulness. Generally, it is only momentary and occasional.  The desire of bettering our condition is the principle which prompts to save.
 It is a desire which is generally calm and dispassionate. It comes with us from birth and stays with us until we die.</description>

It affords no revenue or profit. It is made up of the stock of food, clothes, furniture, etc. which have been bought but not yet entirely consumed.
Houses The whole stock of houses makes a part of this first division.
The stock laid out in a house ceases from being a capital or from affording any revenue.</description>

      <description>Fixed Capital, Circulating Capital, and Stock for Consumption  1  When a man&amp;rsquo;s stock can only maintain him for a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it.
 He consumes it as sparingly as he can. He tries to acquire new supplies before it is consumed.  In this case, his revenue is derived from his labour only. This is the state of most of the labouring poor in all countries.</description>

      <description>88  The circulation of every country is divided into two branches:
 The circulation of the dealers with one another, and The circulation between the dealers and the consumers.  Each circulation requires a certain stock of money.
Paper or metal money may be employed in either circulation.
The value of the goods circulated between the dealers and dealers can never exceed the value of those circulated between dealers and consumers.</description>
