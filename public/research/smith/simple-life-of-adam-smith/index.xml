      <description>1723-1737 Adam Smith was born at Kirkcaldy, in the county of Fife, Scotland, on June 5, 1723. His father was also named Adam Smith who was=
 a native of Aberdeen, a Writer to the Signet, a Judge Advocate for Scotland, and a Comptroller of the Customs in the Kirkcaldy district.  His mother was Margaret, daughter of John Douglas of Strathendry, a considerable landed proprietor in Fife.
Little is known of his father.</description>

      <description>1737-1740 Smith entered Glasgow College in October 1737 and remained there until spring 1740. Back then, the arts curriculum spanned over five sessions. Thus, Smith did not complete the course required for a degree.
He attended three sessions, going through the classes of Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and Moral Philosophy. These classes drew students from afar and had remarkable intellectual activity.
Dr. A. Carlyle came to Glasgow College formoved his divinity classes after he had finished his arts course at Edinburgh.</description>

      <description>Smith left Scotland for Oxford in June 1740, riding the whole way on horseback. He told Samuel Rogers many years afterwards that, from the moment he crossed the Border he was much struck with=
 the richness of the country he was entering, and the great superiority of its agriculture over that of his own country.  Scotch agriculture was not born in 1740, even in the Lothians. The country everywhere was very bare and waste.</description>

      <description>At Oxford Smith returned to Scotland probably to get a Scotch university chair eventually. But he thought in the meantime to get a job as a traveling tutor to the Duke of Buccleugh, who was a ranking and wealthy young man. It was then a much-desired and a highly-paid job.
He afterwards gave up his chair for that job. While looking for that job, he stayed at home with his mother in Kirkcaldy.</description>

      <description>The Edinburgh lectures soon bore fruit.
Mr. Loudon was the Professor of Logic in Glasgow College.
 On his death in 1750, Smith was appointed to the vacant chair and began 13 years of active academic work.  It was by far the happiest, most useful, and honourable period of Smith’s life. The appointment was done by a section of the Senatus called the Faculty Professors. Some of them had been Smith’s teachers 10 years before and knew him well.</description>

      <description>A common misconception was that Smith was helpless in business.
One of his Edinburgh neighbours told Robert Chambers that Smith wrote so well on exchange and barter. But that it was strange that he was obliged to get a friend to buy his horse corn for him.
This idea of his helplessness in the petty transactions arose from observing his=
 occasional fits of absence and  His fits of absence do not seem so frequent nor so prolonged as they are commonly represented.</description>

      <description>In Glasgow, Smith was a teacher and a learner. The conditions of time and place were most favourable for his instruction.
Had he remained at Oxford, he would probably never have been an economist. had he not spent so many of his best years in Glasgow, he would never have been such an eminent one. He grew into a great economist amid=
 the thickening problems of the Clyde’s rising trade, and the daily discussions they occasioned among the town’s enterprising and intelligent merchants.</description>

      <description>During his stay in Glasgow, Smith maintained intimate relations with his old friends in Edinburgh.
 He often visited them by coach even if the journey took 13 hours before the road was improved. He spent most of his many successive vacations among them. He actively promoted some literary, scientific, and social improvement projects then widespread in Scotland. His patron was Henry Home.  In 1752, Mr. Home was raised to the bench as Lord Kames.</description>

      <title>Theory of Moral Sentiments</title>

      <description>Smith enjoyed a very high Scotch reputation long before his name was known to the public by any literary contribution. But in 1759 he gave his Theory of Moral Sentiments to the press. He then took his place in the first rank of contemporary writers, by almost immediate and universal recognition.
The book is an essay supporting and illustrating the doctrine that moral approbation and disapprobation are in the last analysis expressions of sympathy with the feelings of an imaginary and impartial spectator.</description>

      <description>Rev. William Ward of Broughton was the chaplain to the Marquis of Rockingham.
 In 1763, he brought out his Essay on Grammar.  Sir William Hamilton thought that it was “perhaps the most philosophical essay on the English language extant,”
 He sent an abstract of it to Smith through a common friend, Mr. George Baird.  Smith wrote the following letter to Mr. Baird=

      <description>Smith joined his pupil in London in the end of January 1764. They set out for France in the start of February.
They remained abroad 2.5 years=
 10 days in Paris, 18 months in Toulouse, 2 months traveling in the South of France, 2 months in Geneva, and 10 months in Paris again.  Smith kept no journal and wrote as few letters as possible. But from various sources, we can fill in some of the outlines of their travel.</description>

      <description>In the end of August, Smith and his pupils left Toulouse and made an extensive tour in the South of France. (Stewart) No other record remains of this tour.
Lady Mary Coke was the Duke’s aunt. She mentions that when they were at Marseilles they visited the porcelain factory. The Duke bought two of the largest services ever sold there, for which he paid more than £150 sterling. They seem to have arrived in Geneva some time in October.</description>

      <description>Smith left Geneva in December for Paris and arrived around Christmas 1765 (Dugald Stewart).
The Rev. William Cole was in Paris in October 1765. He notes in his journal on October 26 that the Duke of Buccleugh arrived in Paris that day from Spa along with the Earl and Countess of Fife;
But this must be a mistake, for Horace Walpole was also in Paris that autumn.
He writes on December 5 that the Duke was then expected to arrive the following week.</description>

      <description>Smith arrived in London early in November and remained there for the next six months. The body of his unfortunate pupil, which he brought over with him, was ultimately buried in the family vault at Dalkeith, (Dr. Norman Macleod and Mr. Steel)
but the interment there does not seem to have taken place immediately after the arrival from France, for the London journals, which announce the Duke of Buccleugh&amp;rsquo;s landing at Dover on November 1, mention his presence at the Guildhall with his stepfather, Mr.</description>

      <description>When Smith left Glasgow, his mother and cousin went back again to Kirkcaldy. He remained with them there for the next 11 years.
Hume thought that the countryside was unsuitable for a man of letters. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. But Smith had everything he needed in Kirkcaldy=

      <description>1773-1776. Aet. 50-53
In the spring of 1773, Smith virtually completed the Wealth of Nations. He thought of going to London with the manuscript, to give it to a publisher.
But his labours had taken its toll on his health and spirits.
 He thought that he might die suddenly before it got published. He wrote Hume before he went to London. He made Hume his literary executor. He gave him directions on the destination of the various unpublished manuscripts in his depositories=  My Dear Friend—</description>

      <description>The Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was at length published on March 9, 1776.
Bishop Horne was one of Smith’s antagonists.
 He said the books which live longest are those which have been carried longest in the parent’s womb.  The Wealth of Nations took 12 years to write.
 It was in contemplation probably 12 years before that. It was explicitly and publicly promised in 1759, in the concluding paragraph of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, though it is only the partial fulfilment of that promise.</description>

      <description>After the publication of his book in the beginning of March, Smith still dallied in London, without going to see Hume in Edinburgh then bring him to London.
But some hope seems to have been entertained of Hume coming up even without Smith&amp;rsquo;s persuasion and escort.
Bishop John Home thought so. He was in London and was in correspondence with Hume. But Hume wrote no, in a letter on April 12.</description>

      <description>Smith remained at Kirkcaldy from May to December 1776, except for occasional visits to Edinburgh or Dalkeith.
But his thoughts, were again bent on London, as soon as his mother’s health allowed him to leave home. He seems to have enjoyed London. It inspired some hopes in friends like Strahan that he might even settle there permanently. After his departure for Scotland in April, Strahan used to write him of political news keeping him abreast of all that was going on.</description>

      <description>On settling in Edinburgh, Smith took a house in the Canongate—Panmure House. It was at the foot of Panmure Close, one of the steep and narrow wynds that descend from the north side of the Canongate towards the base of the Calton Hill.
This house was his home for the rest of his days. He died in it. The Canongate was the old Court end of Edinburgh. At the end of the 18th century, it was still its fashionable residential quarter.</description>

 the Duchesse d’Enville and the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, her son.  It was written by François de La Rochefoucauld, their ancestor. It was accompanied by the following letter from the Duke himself. He informs Smith that despite of the way François is mentioned in the Theory of Moral Sentiments, the Duke once tried to translate it.</description>

      <description>In 1779, Smith was consulted by the Government on the probable effects of the contemplated concession of free trade to Ireland.
Two letters of Smith still remain=
 one to the Earl of Carlisle, First Lord of Trade and Plantations, and the other to Henry Dundas—which state his views on this subject.  The policy of commercial restriction was most cruelly used against the Irish between the Restoration (1660) and the Union (1707).</description>

      <description>Samuel Rogers was the author of the Pleasures of Memory. He went to Scotland to make its ‘home tour’. It was then much in vogue.
He brought with him letters of introduction to Smith from Dr. Price and Dr. Kippis. Dr. Kippis was the editor of the Biographia Britannica. Rogers, a poet, was then 23. He had only published his Ode to Superstition. His father’s old Unitarian friends were his only chief acquaintances in the world of letters.</description>

      <description>Smith had long contemplated revising the Theory of Moral Sentiments which had been around for 30 years with five editions.
But it never went through any revision. This was the task of the last year of his life. He made considerable changes, especially by addition. He wrote the additions while he was under severe illness.
It was his best writing in point of literary style. (Stewart)
Before the new edition appeared, there was a preliminary difference between author and publisher regarding the propriety of issuing the additions.</description>

      <description>These communications with leading statesmen were showing the impression that the Wealth of Nations had made in this country. Smith was receiving equally satisfactory proofs of its recognition abroad. The book had been translated into Danish in two volumes by F. Dräbye in 1779-80. Apparently, he contemplated publishing a second edition. Through a Danish friend, he asked Smith what changes he proposed in his second edition. Smith then wrote Strahan the following letter, asking him to send a copy of the second edition to Dräbye= — Dear Sir—</description>

      <description>The new edition of the Theory was Smith’s last published work. A French newspaper, the Moniteur Universelle of Paris, announced on March 11, 1790 that Smith would do a critical examination of Montesquieu’s Esprit des Lois.
It speculated that the work would make an epoch in the history of politics and of philosophy.
But there is no evidence that he intended to publish a separate work on Montesquieu. Before March 1790, his strength seems to have been much wasted.</description>

      <description>In his letter to Cadell, Smith reproaches himself with his idleness during his first few years in Edinburgh. He had bought a good many new books in London, or new editions of old ones,
He says that=
“My amusement in reading and diverting myself with them debauched me from my proper business of preparing a new edition of the Wealth of Nations.”
While he was engaged miscellaneous reading, a young interviewer from Glasgow elicited his opinions on most of the famous authors of the world.</description>
