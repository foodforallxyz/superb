                        <p>When Smith left Glasgow, his mother and cousin went back again to Kirkcaldy. He remained with them there for the next 11 years.</p>
<p>Hume thought that the countryside was unsuitable for a man of letters. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. But Smith had everything he needed in Kirkcaldy=</p>
<ul>
<li>his work</li>
<li>his mother</li>
<li>his books</li>
<li>his daily walks in the sea breeze</li>
</ul>
<p>Edinburgh always in the offing as a place of occasional resort. Like Shakespeare at Stratford, Smith liked mingling with the simple old folk from his youth. He had a few neighbours whose pursuits corresponded with his own.</p>
<p>Smith wrote that James Oswald was now struck down with illness, a &ldquo;terrible distress&rdquo;. He died in the second year after Smith&rsquo;s return to Scotland.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Robert Beatson was one of Smith&rsquo;s other literary neighbours. He was the author of the Political Index and other works. Smith saw much of him during this 11 years&rsquo; residence in Fife.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After being established in Kirkcaldy for some weeks, Smith wrote Hume that he was immersed in study. It was the only business he had. His sole amusements were long solitary walks by the seaside and was happiest. However, his work impacted his health.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This letter was to serve a friend, as so usual with Smith.
It was a motive which never failed to overcome his aversion to writing.</p>
<p>According to Smith, Count de Sarsfield was</p>
<ul>
<li>Smith&rsquo;s best French friend</li>
<li>of Irish descent</li>
<li>was an associate of Turgot and the other men of letters in Paris</li>
<li>wrote many essays on economic questions, though he never published any of them.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Hume was now Undersecretary of State.</p>
<p>Smith who was then in London, wanted Hume to show the Count some attentions during his residence there.</p>

<p>John Adams was the second President of the United States. When he was an envoy for the United States in Paris, he was very intimate with Sarsfield.
Adams says that Sarsfield was the happiest man he knew, for he led the life of a peripatetic philosopher.
&ldquo;Observation and reflection are all his business.
His dinner and his friend all his pleasure.
If a man were born for himself alone, I would take him for a model.&quot;[201]
He was &ldquo;the greatest rider of hobby-horses&rdquo; in all President Adams&rsquo;s acquaintance.
Some of his hobbies were for the most serious studies.
He published a work in metaphysics.
He wrote essays=
against serfdom and slavery, and
on other subjects found in[Pg 241] MS. among President Adams&rsquo;s papers.
Yet he was a problem—and not a very soluble one—to the worthy President.
For he laid a weight on the merest trifles of ceremony or etiquette which seemed difficult to reconcile with his devotion to profound and learned studies.
He visited Adams at Washington during his presidency.
He used constantly to lecture the President on his little omissions.
After any entertainment Sarsfield would say , &ldquo;that I should have placed the Ambassador of France at my right hand and the Minister of Spain at my left, and have arranged the other principal personages; and
when I rose from the table I should have said, Messieurs, voudrez vous, etc., or Monsieur or Duc voudrez vous, etc.
How can these trifling contemplations of a master of the ceremonies be reconciled with the vast knowledge of arts, sciences, history, government, etc., possessed by this nobleman?&quot;[202] (Adams)
Sarsfield kept a journal about all the people he met with, from which Adams makes some interesting quotations, and which, if extant, might be expected to add to our information regarding Smith.
Below is Smith&rsquo;s letter= —</p>
<p>Kirkaldy, June 7, 1767.</p>
<p>My Dearest Friend— This is to recommend to you the Count de Sarsfield.
He is my best and most agreeable friend in France.
You can introduce him to all the friends of your absent friend, to Oswald and to Elliot in particular.
I am so anxious that his stay in London should be rendered agreeable to him.
You know that he is a plain, worthy, honourable man.
This letter is for him.
You can send it to him yourself if the weighty affairs of State allow.
You may send the letter to Dr. Morton[203] by the Penny Post.
[Pg 242]
My Business here is study.
I have been very deeply engaged in it for about a month.
My amusements are long solitary walks by the seaside.
You may judge how I spend my time.
However, I feel extremely happy, comfortable, and contented.
I never was perhaps more so in all my life.</p>
<p>You will give me great comfort=
by writing to me now and then, and
by letting me know what is passing among my friends at London.
Remember me to them all, particularly=
to Mr. Adams&rsquo;s family and
to Mrs. Montagu.[204]</p>
<p>What has become of Rousseau?
Has he gone abroad because he cannot contrive to get himself sufficiently persecuted in Great Britain?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the bargain that your ministry has made with the India Company?
I see that they have not prolonged their charter, which is a good thing.[205]</p>
<p>The rest of the sheet is torn.
Hume replies on the 13th that Sarsfield was=
a very good friend of his own,
always a great pleasure in meeting, as he was a man of merit.
But Hume did not introduce Sarsfield=
to Sir Gilbert Elliot, because &ldquo;this gentleman&rsquo;s reserve and indolence would make him neglect the acquaintance&rdquo;;
nor to Oswald, because Hume&rsquo;s intimacy with Oswald, which lasted more than 25 years, was broken forever.
He describes his quarrel with Oswald&rsquo;s brother the bishop and concludes=
&ldquo;If I were sure, dear Smith, that you and I should not some day quarrel in some such manner, I should tell you that I am yours affectionately and sincerely.&quot;[206]
Count de Sarsfield seems to have gone on to Scotland to visit Smith.
For on July 14, Hume writes Smith, enclosing a packet for the Count.</p>
<p>Smith did not reply to either of these letters until September 13, when he writes from Dalkeith House, [Pg 243]where he has gone for the homecoming of the Duke and Duchess of Buccleugh.
&ldquo;He is a brute and a beast,&rdquo; says Smith about the bishop.
He goes on to bespeak Hume&rsquo;s favour for a young cousin of his who happened to be living in the same house with Hume in London, Captain David Skene, afterwards of Pitlour, who was in 1787 made inspector of military roads in Scotland.</p>
<p>Please send the enclosed letter to the Count de Sarsfield.
I am sorry for having delayed to write both of you so long.
David Skeene is a very amiable, modest, brave, worthy young gentleman who lives in the same house with you.
He and I are sisters&rsquo; sons.
But my regard for him is much more founded on his personal qualities than on our family relations.
He recently acted very gallantly in America.
I only knew about this within these few days.
Please be of any service to him.
The Duke and Dutchess of Buccleugh have been here now for almost a fortnight.
They begin to open their house on next Monday.
They will both be very agreeable to the People of this country.
The Dutchess is the most agreeable woman that I have ever seen.
I am sorry that you are not here, because I am sure you would be perfectly in love with her.
I shall probably be here some weeks.
But I wish that both you and the Count de Sarsfield would direct for me as usual at Kirkaldy.
I want to know Rousseau&rsquo;s true history before and since he left England.
I shall keep it a secret.
I ever am, dear sir, most faithfully yours,
Adam Smith.[207]</p>
<p>The Duke of Buccleugh had never been at Dalkeith since his infancy. (Dr. Carlyle) [Pg 244]
Because his stepfather, Charles Townshend, was afraid he might grow up too Scotch in accent and feeling.
His home-coming with his young and beautiful bride, excited the liveliest interest and expectation on=
the Buccleugh estates and
over the whole lowlands of Scotland, from the Forth to the Solway.
The original day for the celebration was the Duke&rsquo;s birthday, September 13, the very day Smith wrote Hume.
But the event had to be postponed because of Townshend&rsquo;s sudden death from an attack of putrid fever which he got between the Duke&rsquo;s arrival at Dalkeith and his birthday.
It came off, however, two or three weeks later.
An entertainment was given to about 50 ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhood;
Dr. Carlyle was present and wrote an ode for the occasion.
He says that=
the fare was sumptuous,
but the company was formal and dull.
Because the guests were all strangers to their host and hostess except Adam Smith.
Adam Smith was ill qualified to promote the jollity of a birthday. (Carlyle)
&ldquo;Had it not been for Alexander Macmillan, W.S., and myself, the meeting=
would have been very dull, and
might have been dissolved without even drinking the health of the day..
Smith remained with the Duke and Duchess for two months.
He then returned to Kirkcaldy to his mother and his studies.
I have often thought since that if they had brought down a man of more address than he was, how much sooner their first appearance might have been.&quot;[208]</p>
<p>Smith was thus blamed for not being able to break the ice on this first meeting of his pupil with his Scotch neighbours.
But it soon melted away naturally under the warmth of the Duke&rsquo;s own kindness.
The Duke almost settled among them.
For on Townshend&rsquo;s death he gave up the idea of going into politics as an active career.
Townshend had set [Pg 245]his heart on it.
It was why he trained the young Duke under Smith, a political philosopher.
He lived largely on his Scotch estates.
He became=
a father to his numerous tenantry, and
a powerful and enlightened promoter of all sound agricultural improvement.
Dr. Carlyle says the family were always kind to their tenants.
But Duke Henry &ldquo;surpassed them all, as much in justice and humanity as he did in superiority of understanding and good sense.&rdquo;
Without claiming for Smith&rsquo;s teaching what must in any case have been largely the result of a fine natural character, no young man could live for three years in daily intimacy with Adam Smith without being powerfully influenced by that deep love of justice and humanity.
It animated Smith beyond his fellows.
It ran as warmly through his conversation in private life as we see it still runs through his published writings.
Smith was always=
vigorous and weighty in his denunciation of wrong, and
so impatient of the indifference or palliation towards it, that he could not feel at ease in the presence of the palliator.
He once said of a palliator who had just left the company=  &ldquo;We can breathe more freely now, that man has no indignation in him.&quot;[209]</p>
<p>Smith remained the Duke&rsquo;s mentor all his life.
He was always a most honoured guest at &ldquo;Dalkeith, which all the virtues love,&rdquo; .
Smith always spoke with much satisfaction and gratitude of his relations with the family of Buccleugh. (Dugald Stewart)
Several of the traditional anecdotes of Smith&rsquo;s absence of mind are localised at Dalkeith House.
For example, Lord Brougham preserved a story of Smith breaking out at dinner strongly condemning a leading statesman&rsquo;s public conduct.
He then suddenly stopping short on perceiving that statesman&rsquo;s [Pg 246]nearest relation on the opposite side of the table, and presently losing self-recollection again and muttering to himself, &ldquo;Deil care, deil care, it&rsquo;s all true.&rdquo;
It shows that=
Smith habitually spoke his mind with considerable plainness, and
he shrank at the same time from personal discourtesy.
There is the less pointed story told by Archdeacon Sinclair when Smith was dining at Dalkeith, and two sons of Lord Dorchester were of the company.
The conversation all turned on Lord Dorchester&rsquo;s estates and Lord Dorchester&rsquo;s affairs.
Smith interposed and said, &ldquo;Pray, who is Lord Dorchester? I have never heard so much of him before.&rdquo;
It shows his continued absence of mind.</p>
<p>From Dalkeith Smith returns to Kirkcaldy and his work.
We find him in 1768 in correspondence with the Duke&rsquo;s law-agent, Mr. A. Campbell, W.S., and with Sir James Johnstone of Westerhall.
It was about some investigation, of no public importance, into the genealogy of the Scotts.
He first got Campbell to search the charter-room of Dalkeith for ancient papers on the Scotts of Thirlestane.
He then wanted to know Sir James Johnstone&rsquo;s explanation of Scott of Davington&rsquo;s claim as heir of Rennaldburn on the Duke of Buccleugh.[210]
It shows Smith taking an interest in the Duke&rsquo;s business affairs.
We also find him in correspondence with Lord Hailes on historical points of some consequence to the economic inquiries he was now busy on.
Lord Hailes was one of the precursors of sound historical investigation in this country.
Smith was long intimate with him [Pg 247].
He afterwards paid the curious compliment of translating his letter to Strahan on Hume&rsquo;s death into Latin.</p>
<p>Only two letters have been preserved of Smith&rsquo;s correspondence with Hailes= —</p>
<p>Kirkaldy, March 5, 1769. My lord—
Please send me the papers you mentioned on the prices of provisions in former times.
I shall send my own servant sometime this week to receive them at your house at Edinburgh.
I have not been able to get the papers in the cause of Lord Galloway and Lord Morton.
Please also send them to me if you have them.
I shall return both as soon as possible.
I shall transcribe the manuscript papers if you want.</p>
<p>Since I wrote you the last time, I have read the Acts of James I very carefully.
I compared them with your remarks.
I have had much pleasure and instruction from your remarks.
Your remarks are much more useful to me than mine will be to you.
I have read law entirely in order to form some general notion of the great outlines of the plan according to which justice has been administered in different ages and nations.
I have entered very little into the details.
I see you have very much mastered them.
Your Lordship&rsquo;s particular facts will be very useful to correct my general views.
But I fear that my general views will always be too vague and superficial to be of much use to you.</p>
<p>I have nothing to add to what you have observed on the Acts of James I.
They are framed in general in a much ruder and more inaccurate manner than the English statutes or French ordinances of the same period.
Scotland seems to have been in greater disorder than France or England had been from the time of the Danish and Norwegian incursions.
The 5, 24, 56, and 85 statutes seem to attempt a remedy to one and the same abuse.
Traveling, from the disorders of the country, must have been extremely dangerous, [Pg 248]and consequently very rare.
Few people therefore would propose to live by entertaining travelers.
Consequently, there would be few or no inns.
Travellers would be obliged to have recourse to the hospitality of private families in the same manner as in all other barbarous countries.
Being in this situation real objects of compassion, private families would think themselves obliged to receive them even though this hospitality was extremely oppressive.
Homer says=
that strangers are sacred persons, and under the protection of Jupiter,
but no wise man would ever choose to send for a stranger unless he was a bard or a soothsayer.
The danger of traveling alone or with few attendants made all men of consequence bring many retainers with them.
It made this hospitality still more oppressive.
Hence the orders to build hostellaries in 24 and 85.
Many people chose to=
follow the old fashion and
live at the expense of other people than at their own.
Hence the complaint of the keepers of the hostellaries and the order thereupon in Act 85.</p>
<p>I end this long letter with my concern and indignation at what has lately passed at London and Edinburgh.
I have often thought that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Supreme Court very much resembled a jury.
The law lords generally=
sum up the evidence and
explain the law to the other peers.
The peers generally follow their opinion implicitly.
Two law lords on this occasion instructed them.
One has always run after the mob&rsquo;s applause.
The other, by far the most intelligent, has always shown the greatest dread of popular odium.
However, he has not been able to avoid it.
His inclinations also have always been suspected to favour one of the parties.
On this occasion, I suspect that he has followed his fears and inclinations than his judgment.
I can say more about this, but I would rather have the solid reputation of your most respectable president, though exposed to the insults of a brutal mob, than all the vain and flimsy applause that has ever yet been bestowed on either or both the other two.—
I have the honour to be, with the highest esteem and regard, my Lord, your Lordship&rsquo;s most obliged and obedient servant,
Adam Smith.[211]</p>
<p>[Pg 249]
A week later, Smith wrote Lord Hailes another letter.
It gave the beginning of his speculations on the price of silver. (Lord Brougham)
But the letter seems now lost.
Lord Brougham quotes from it only the following sentences on the Douglas cause.
&ldquo;There is little joy if the rejoicings in the public papers arising from the Douglas cause were the same as those here.
It would be the same rejoicing as if four schoolboys had set up three candles for lighting.&quot;[212]</p>
<p>The first of these letters was written almost immediately after Smith heard of the House of Lords&rsquo; decision in the famous Douglas case.
The news of the decision only reached Edinburgh on March 2.
The whole city was so enthusiastic about it.
Smith walking by the shore at Kirkcaldy would have seen the bonfires blazing on Salisbury Crags.
The Lord President of the Court of Session was opposed to the Douglas claim.
Smith heard that he was attacked by the mob.
The President was insulted the next morning in the street on his way to Court.
No civil lawsuit ever excited so much popular interest or feeling.
Mr. Douglas was heir to the estates of the late Duke of Douglas.
The Duke&rsquo;s sister was Lady Jane.
She secretly married her husband, Sir John Stewart of Grandtully, abroad when she was already 50 years old.
The question was whether Mr. Douglas was really=
the son of Lady Jane or
an impostor, the son of a Frenchwoman, whom Lady Jane had brought up as her own son to inherit those estates.
Everybody in Scotland was either a Douglas or a Hamilton, [Pg 250].
The case&rsquo;s sentimental elements gave the Douglas side strong popular sympathy.
Smith strongly sided with the unpopular and losing Hamilton side.
Lord Hailes was one of the judges.
He voted with the Lord President against Mr. Douglas.
The House of Lords now reversed that decision.
Lord Camden and Lord Mansfield were great English judges
Smith very rashly impeached their impartiality
This was indefensible. (Broughman)
David Hume was a Tory and an Undersecretary of State.
But he also denounced Lord Camden and Lord Mansfield and his own peers.
&ldquo;To one who understands the case as I do, the pleading of the two law lords appears most scandalous.
Such curious misrepresentation, such impudent assertions, such groundless imputations, never came from that place.
But they were good enough for the audience, who are a little better than their brothers the Wilkites of the streets.&rdquo; (Hume writing to Dr. Blair)
Hume lost his place with a change of ministry.
He returned to Edinburgh for good in August 1769, and wrote Smith inviting him over= —</p>
<p>James&rsquo;s Court, August 20, 1769.</p>
<p>Dear Smith—
I am glad to have seen you and Kirkaldy.
But I also wish to be within speaking terms of you, I wish we could concert measures for that purpose.
I am miserably sick at sea.
I regard with horror and a kind of hydrophobia the great gulf that lies between us.
I am also tired of traveling as much as you ought naturally to be of staying at home.
I therefore propose to you to come hither and pass some days with me in this solitude.
I want to know what you have been doing, and purpose to exact a rigorous [Pg 251]account of the method in which you have employed yourself during your retreat.
I am positive you are in the wrong in many of your speculations, especially when you have the misfortune to differ from me.
All these are reasons for our meeting, and I wish you would make me some reasonable proposal for that purpose.
There is no habitation on the island of Inchkeith, otherwise I should challenge you to meet me on that spot, and neither of us ever to leave the place till we were fully agreed on all points of controversy.
I expect General Conway here to-morrow, whom I shall attend to Roseneath, and I shall remain there a few days.
On my return I expect to find a letter from you containing a bold acceptance of this defiance.
I am, dear Smith, yours sincerely.[213]<br>
Smith seems to have made such progress with his work in the two years of his retreat at Kirkcaldy.
In the beginning of 1770, there was some word of his going up with it to London for publication.
On February 6, Hume again writes him=
&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, dear Smith, which we hear, that you are not to be here above a day or two on your passage to London?
How can you publish a book full of reason, sense, and learning to those wicked abandoned madmen?&quot;[214]</p>
<p>He had probably completed his first draft of the work.
But he kept amplifying and altering parts of it for six years more.
He did not go to London in 1770.
But he came to Edinburgh and received the freedom of the city in June.
He seems to have received this honour for the merits of the Duke of Buccleugh rather than for his own.
For the entry in the minutes of the Council June 6, 1770 runs=</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appoint the Dean of Guild and his Council to admit and receive their Graces the Duke of Buccleugh and the Duke of Montagu in the most ample form, for good services done by them and their noble ancestors to the kingdome.
And also Adam Smith, LL.D., and [Pg 252]the Reverend Mr. John Hallam to be Burgesses and Gild Brethren of this city in the most ample form.
(Signed) James Stuart, Provost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke of Montagu was the Duke of Buccleugh&rsquo;s father-in-law/
The Rev. Mr. John Hallam was afterwards Dean of Windsor.
He was the father of Henry Hallam, the historian.
He was the Duke&rsquo;s tutor at Eton, as Adam Smith was his tutor abroad.
The freedom was therefore given to the Duke of Buccleugh and party.
Smith&rsquo;s burgess-ticket is one of the few relics of him still extant.
It is possessed by Professor Cunningham of Belfast.</p>
<p>Smith promised Hume a visit about Christmas 1771.
But the visit was postponed because of the illness of Hume&rsquo;s sister.
On January 28, he received the following letter, replying to a request for the address of the Comtesse de Boufflers in Paris= —</p>
<p>Edinburgh, January 28, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Smith—
I should certainly before this time have challenged the Performance of your Promise of being with me about Christmas had it not been for the misfortunes of my family.
Last month my sister fell dangerously ill of a fever.
The fever is now gone.
But she is still so weak and low.
She recovers so slowly that I was afraid it would be a melancholy house to invite you to.
However, I expect that she will get better in time and by then I shall look for your company.
I shall not take any excuse from your own state of health, which I suppose only a subterfuge invented by indolence and love of solitude.
My dear Smith, if you continue to hearken to complaints of this nature, you will cut yourself out entirely from human society, to the great loss of both parties.</p>
<p>The Lady&rsquo;s Direction is Me la Comtesse de B., Douanière au Temple.
She has a daughter-in-law, which makes it requisite to distinguish her.—
Yours sincerely,
David Hume.</p>
<p>P.S.—I have not yet read Orlando Inamorato.
I am now reading the Italian historians.
I am confirmed in my former opinion that that language has not produced one author who [Pg 253]knew how to write elegant correct prose.
Though it contains several excellent poets.
You say nothing to me of your own work.[215]</p>
<p>Smith seems to have perhaps sent him Orlando Inamorato, or have been writing or talking about it.
The Italian poets were favourite reading of his.
This letter indicates that Smith&rsquo;s labours and solitude were beginning to impact his health.
Poor health had now become one of the chief causes of his delay in finishing his work.
It continued to go from bad to worse.
Smith&rsquo;s book would have been ready for the press by the first of that winter if it were not for the interruptions caused by=
bad health=
from &ldquo;the lack of amusement and
from thinking too much on one thing&rdquo;, with
other interruptions by his endeavours to extricate some of his personal friends from their difficulties in the commercial crisis of that time. (Smith writing to his friend Pulteney in September)</p>
<p>Kirkaldy, September 5, 1772.</p>
<p>My dear Pulteney—
I have received your most friendly letter.
I have delayed too long to answer it.
I have had no concern in the Public calamities.
But some of my closest friends have been deeply concerned in them.
My attention has been much occupied about the best way of extricating them.</p>
<p>In the Book which I am now preparing for the press, I have treated fully and distinctly of every part of the subject which you have recommended to me.
I intended to send you some extracts from it.
But after looking them over, I find that they are too much interwoven with other parts of the work to be easily separated from it.
I have the same opinion of Sir James Stewart&rsquo;s book that you have.
Without once mentioning it, [Pg 254]any false principle in it will meet with a clear and distinct confutation in mine.[216]</p>
<p>Thank you very much for mentioning me to the East India Directors as a person who would be of use to them.
You have acted in your old way of doing your friends a good office behind their backs, pretty much as other people do them a bad one.
I will readily undertake any kind of labour from you.
Mr. Stewart and Mr. Ferguson hinted to me on your notice of the proper remedy for the disorders of the coin in Bengal.
I believe our opinions on that subject are perfectly the same.</p>
<p>My book would have been ready for the press by the beginning of this winter.
I must delay its publication for a few months=
because of interruptions occasioned partly by bad health=
from lack of amusement and
from thinking too much on one thing.
partly because of the avocations above-mentioned,
My dearest Pulteney, I ever am most faithfully and affectionately your obliged servant,
Adam Smith.</p>
<p>To William Pulteney, Esq., Member of Parliament, Bath House, London.[217]</p>
<p>Those public calamities were the bankruptcies of the severe commercial crisis of 1772, and
Most likely, the Buccleugh family were the friends he tried so much to extricate from it.
The crash was especially disastrous in Scotland.
Only 3 out of 30 private banks in Edinburgh survived it.
Douglas Heron and Company was a large joint-stock bank.
It started only three years before, for the public-spirited purpose of promoting improvements, particularly improvements of land.
It now seemed to shake all commercial Scotland with its fall.
The Duke of Buccleugh was one of its largest shareholders.
His [Pg 255]liability was unlimited.
It was impossible to foresee how much of its £800,000 of liabilities the Duke might eventually be called on to pay.
The suggestion that Smith was much consulted by the Duke and his advisers about this grave business is confirmed by his familiarity with the bank&rsquo;s circumstances at the time of its failure in Chapter 2 of Book 2 of the Wealth of Nations.</p>
<p>The situation for which Pulteney had recommended him to the Court of Directors of the East India Company was a place as member of the Special Commission of Supervision which they then contemplated establishing.
In 1772, the East India Company was in extremities.
In July, they were nearly 1.5 million sterling behind for their next quarter&rsquo;s payments.
They proposed to send a commission to India of three independent and competent men,
They would have full authority to=
institute a complete examination into every detail of the administration, and
exercise a certain supervision and control of the whole.
Burke had already been offered one of the seats on this commission.
But he had refused it on finding that Lord Rockingham was unwilling to part with him.
Adam Ferguson and Andrew Stuart, M.P. were Scotch friends of Smith.
At the time this letter was written, they=
were actually candidates for the places, and
had apparently been recently seeing Pulteney in London on the subject.
Pulteney had great influence at the India House.
He had probably mentioned the names of Smith, Ferguson, and Stuart to the Court of Directors at the same time.
That must have been at least two months before Smith wrote this letter,
For in July, Ferguson was  getting influence brought to bear on the Edinburgh Town Council to secure their permission to retain his professorship in the event of his going to India.[218]
Ferguson pushed his candidature vigorously.
He [Pg 256]went to London repeatedly about it between July and November.
But Smith, although he would have accepted the post if he received the offer of it, does not seem to have taken any steps to procure it.
He did not even answer Pulteney&rsquo;s letter until September.
Stuart&rsquo;s candidature was defeated Horace Walpole says, by Lord Mansfield, but eventually no appointment was made
because Parliament intervened, and forbade any such commission to be sent out at all.</p>
<p>Professor Rogers sent the letter to the Academy for publication.
In it, he  observes that the delay in the publication of the Wealth of Nations was due to the negotiations which Mr. Pulteney was making to get Smith appointed to this place.
Mr. Rogers says=
&ldquo;Had he succeeded, it is probable that the Wealth of Nations would never have seen the light.
for every one knows that in the first and second books of that work the East India Company is criticised with the greatest severity&hellip;.
Due to Pulteney&rsquo;s negotiations, it lay unrevised and unaltered during four years in Smith&rsquo;s desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a strange remark to fall from an editor of the Wealth of Nations.
For the evidences of continuous revision and alteration during those four years are very numerous in the text of the work itself.
He made many changes or additions in 1773.
For example, the remarks on the price of hides,[219] in the chapter on Rent, were written in February 1773.
The remarks on the decline of sugar-refining in colonies taken from the French, in the chapter on the Colonies,[220] were written in October.
The passage on American wages in the chapter on Wages, was inserted some time in 1773.
The extensive additions in the chapters on the Revenue was occasioned by reading the Mémoires concernant les Droits.
It must have been written after 1774.
Because Smith probably obtained that [Pg 257]book after Turgot became Minister in mid-1774.
In 1775, he added his remarks=
on the effects of recent events on the trade with North America,[221] in the chapter on Colonies, and
on the Irish revenue in the chapter on Public Debts.[222]
The chapter on the Regulated Companies was apparently not written until 1782.
The East India Company receives most systematic attention in it.
It did not appear in the book&rsquo;s first edition.[223]</p>
<p>The book therefore did not lie &ldquo;unrevised and unaltered&rdquo; in Smith&rsquo;s desk from 1772 to 1776.
On the contrary, the chief cause of the four years&rsquo; delay was its revision and alteration during that whole term.
The particular Indian appointment for which Pulteney had recommended him could have nothing to do with the delay, inasmuch as the proposed office was suppressed within two months after this letter was written;
Even if he expected any other sort from the East India Company, there is no reason why he should have withheld his work from publication.
The more elaborate criticism of that Company in the chapter on Public Works did not appear in the book&rsquo;s original edition at all.
The only remarks on Indian administration which appeared in the original edition were merely incidental in character.
But they are very strong and decided.
They might easily have been omitted if Smith wanted to please the Company, without any injury to the general argument they were connected with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a lot of evidence that Smith was=
busy for most of three years after this date, and
mainly in London, altering, improving, and adding to the book&rsquo;s manuscript.
New lines of investigation would suggest themselves.
New theories to be thought out.
The task would grow day by day by a very simple but [Pg 258]unforeseen process of natural accretion.
Hume thought it was near completion in 1769.
But towards the end of 1772, two months after Smith&rsquo;s answer to Pulteney, he gives it most of another year for being finished.
From his new quarters in St. Andrew Square, he writes asking Smith to break off his studies for a few weeks&rsquo; relaxation with him in Edinburgh about Christmas, and then to return and finish his work before the following autumn.</p>
<p>St. Andrew&rsquo;s Square, November 23, 1772.</p>
<p>Dear Smith—
I should agree to your Reasoning if I could trust your Resolution.
Come hither for some weeks about Christmas;
dissipate yourself a little; return to Kirkaldy;
finish your work before autumn;
go to London, print it, return and settle in this town, which suits your studious, independent turn even better than London.
Execute this plan faithfully, and I forgive you&hellip;.
Ferguson has returned fat and fair and in good humour, despite his disappointment,[224] which I am glad of.
He comes over next week to a house in this neighbourhood.
Pray come over this winter and join us.—
I am, my dear Smith, ever yours,
David Hume.[225]</p>
<p>While Pulteney was suggesting Smith&rsquo;s name for employment under the East India Company, Baron Mure was trying to secure his services as tutor to the Duke of Hamilton.
Lord Stanhope possibly offered him the position of tutor to his lordship&rsquo;s ward, the young Earl of Chesterfield.
Baron Mure was one of the guardians of the young Duke of Hamilton (the son of the beautiful Miss Gunning),
He had the chief responsibility in raising and carrying on the great Douglas cause.
He was a man of great sagacity and weight.
We see this in the communication with Hume and Oswald on economic subjects.
He had also been long personally intimate with Smith.
He seems to have been anxious in 1772 to send Smith abroad with the Duke of Hamilton, as he [Pg 259]had already been sent abroad with the Duke of Buccleugh.
Smith would appear to have been sounded on the subject, and even to have given what was considered a favourable reply.
For Andrew Stuart, a fellow-guardian of the Duke along with Mure, writes the latter acknowledging receipt of his letter &ldquo;intimating&rdquo;—these are the words—&ldquo;the practicability of having Mr. Smith,&rdquo; but the Duke&rsquo;s mother (then Duchess of Argyle) and the Duke himself preferred Dr. John Moore, the author of Zelucco, who was the family medical attendant, and was indeed chosen because he could act in that capacity to his very delicate young charge, though he was strictly required to drop the &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo;
He was severely censured by the Duchess for assisting at a surgical operation in Geneva, inasmuch as if it got known that he was a medical man it would be a bar to their reception in the best society.[226]
Accordingly, Mure was told that it was &ldquo;the united opinion of all concerned that matters go no further with Mr. Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron Mure was so wise and practical a head.
His thinking of Smith for this post is a proof=
that the Buccleugh tutorship had been a success, and
that the other men who knew Smith well, did not consider him as so unfit as a traveling tutor as some of his friends thought him.
During this period of severe study in Kirkcaldy his fits of absence might be expected to recur occasionally.
Dr. Charles Rogers relates an anecdote of one of them.
But Dr. Rogers omits mentioning any authority for it.
Stories of that kind must be accepted with scruples.
Because they are so apt to agglomerate round any person noted for the failing they indicate.
According to Dr. Rogers, Smith, during his residence in Kirkcaldy, went out one Sunday morning in his dressing-gown to walk in the garden.
But once in the [Pg 260]garden, he went on to the path leading to the turnpike road, and then to the road itself.
He continued on it in a condition of reverie until he reached Dunfermline, 15 miles away, just as the bells were sounding and the people were proceeding to church.
The strange sound of the bells was the first thing that roused Smith from the meditation he was immersed in.[227]
The story is very open to criticism.
But if correct, it points to=
sleepless nights and
an incapacity to get a subject out of the head, due to over-application.
According to Robert Chambers in his Picture of Scotland, Smith&rsquo;s persistence with his book left a mark on the wall of his study.
It remained there until the room was repainted shortly before Chambers wrote of it in 1827.
Chambers says that Smith habitually=
composed standing, and
dictated to an amanuensis.
He usually stood with his back to the fire.
Unconsciously, in the process of thought he used to make his head vibrate, or rub sidewise against the wall above the chimney-piece.
His head was dressed with pomatum, in the ordinary style of that period.
It made a mark on the wall.
Smith dictated the Wealth of Nations but did not dictate the Theory of Moral Sentiments. (M&rsquo;Culloch)
I cannot say whether he had any external ground for this assertion.
If he dictated his lectures and his Wealth of Nations in Edinburgh to an amanuensis, he would have done the same with his Theory.
But M&rsquo;Culloch sees internal evidences of this difference of manual method in the different style of those works.
Moore met M&rsquo;Culloch one evening at Longman&rsquo;s.
They discussed writers who dictated as they composed.
One of the party said the habit of dictating always bred a diffuse style.
M&rsquo;Culloch supported this view by the example [Pg 261]of Adam Smith.
His Wealth of Nations was very diffuse because it had been dictated.
While his Theory, which was not dictated, was admirable in style. (M&rsquo;Culloch)
But in reality there is probably more diffuse writing in the Theory than in the Wealth of Nations, which is for the most part packed tightly enough.
Archibald Alison the elder was the author of the Essay on Taste and was another Scotch critic.
He even surpasses M&rsquo;Culloch in his keenness in detecting the effects of this dictating habit.
He says that Smith used to walk up and down the room while he dictated.
As a  consequence, his sentences are nearly all the same length.
Each contained as much as the amanuensis could write down while the author took a single turn.[228]
This is excessive acuteness.
Smith&rsquo;s sentences are not all of one length, or all of the same construction.
It need only be added that the habit of dictating would in his case arise naturally from his slow and laboured penmanship.</p>
<p>The Wealth of Nations was composed in a house in the main street of the town.
But its garden ran down to the beach.
It was only pulled down in 1844, without anybody then and there that they were destroying their most interesting association.
It has been a cause of much regret since.
However, an engraving of it exists.

In the spring of 1773, Smith virtually completed the Wealth of Nations.
He thought of going to London with the manuscript, to=
give it perhaps some finishing touches and
give it to a publisher.
But his labours had taken its toll on his health and spirits.
He thought that he might die suddenly before it got published.
He wrote Hume before he went to London.
He made Hume his literary executor.
He gave him directions on the destination of the various unpublished manuscripts in his depositories= —
My Dear Friend—
I have left the care of all my literary papers to you.
The only ones worth publishing are=
those which I carry with me, and
a fragment of a great work which has a history of the astronomical systems that were successively in fashion up to Descartes&rsquo; time.
I leave it to you if it will be published as a fragment of an intended juvenile work.
But I think that there is more refinement than solidity in some parts of it.
You will find this little work in a thin folio paper book in my writing-desk in my book-room.
I want the following to be destroyed without any examination=
all the other loose paper which you will find=
in that desk or
within the glass folding-doors of a bureau which stands in my bedroom
around 18 thin paper folio books
You will also find them within the same glass folding-doors.
Unless I die very suddenly,[Pg 263] I shall take care that the Papers I carry with me shall be carefully sent to you.
I ever am, my dear friend, most faithfully yours,
Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Edinburgh, April 16, 1773. To David Hume, Esq., 9 St. Andrew&rsquo;s Square, Edinburgh.[229]</p>
<p>Smith went to London shortly after writing this letter.
He spent most of the next four years there.
We find him there in May 1773, for he is admitted to the Royal Society on May 27.
He is there in September, for Ferguson then writes to him as if he were still there.
He is there in February 1774, for Hume writes him in that month &ldquo;Pray what accounts are these we hear of Franklyn&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo;
This could only be asked to a person who was in a better position to know about Franklin than Hume himself.
He is there in September 1774, for he writes Cullen from town in September.
He speaks of having been there for some time.
He is there in January 1775, for on the 11th, Bishop Percy met him at dinner at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;, along with Johnson, Burke, Gibbon, and others.[230]
He is there in February 1775, for a young friend, Patrick Clason, addresses a letter to him in February to the care of Cadell, the bookseller, in the Strand.
He is there in December 1775, for on the 27th, Horace Walpole writes to the Countess of Ossory=
&ldquo;Adam Smith told us the other night at Beauclerk&rsquo;s that Major Preston—one of two, but he is not sure which—would have been an excellent commander some years hence if he had seen any service.
I said it was a pity that the war had not been put off until the Major were older  [Pg 264].&quot;[231]
He returned to Scotland in April 1776, around a month after his book was issued.
But we find him back again in London in January 1777, for his letter to Governor Pownall in January is dated from Suffolk Street.
The first three years of his stay in London was probably continuous.</p>
<p>Those three years were spent on the Wealth of Nations.
Much of the book must have been written in London.
When he went to London, he had no idea that his fresh investigations there would detain him so long.
He wrote Pulteney even in the previous September, that=
the book would be finished in a few months, and
he led Hume and Adam Ferguson to look for its publication in 1773.
In a footnote to the 4th edition of his History of Civil Society, published in that year, Ferguson says=
&ldquo;The public will probably soon be furnished (by Mr. Smith, author of the Theory of Moral Sentiments) with a theory of national economy equal to what has ever appeared on any subject of science.&rdquo;
But Smith&rsquo;s researches in London=
must have been much more important than he expected and
must have occasioned extensive alterations and additions.
Hume congratulated him on its eventual appearance in 1776.
He writes=
&ldquo;It is probably much improved by your last abode in London.&rdquo;
Whole chapters seem to have been put through the forge afresh.
On some of them, Smith has tool-marked the date of his handiwork himself.</p>
<p>A very circumstantial account from America of Smith&rsquo;s London labours at the book exists.
Mr. Watson, author of the Annals of Philadelphia, says=
&ldquo;Dr. Franklin once told Dr. Logan that when the celebrated Adam Smith was writing his Wealth of Nations, Smith habitually [Pg 265] brought chapter after chapter as he composed it to Dr. Franklin, Dr. Price, and others of the literati.
He then patiently heard their observations, discussions, and criticisms.
Sometimes he=
write whole chapters anew, and
even reversed some of his propositions.&quot;[232]</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s remark may have been enlarged before it was printed.
It might have been exaggerated.
But there seems no ground for rejecting it altogether.
Smith became acquainted with Franklin in Edinburgh in 1759.
He saw much of Franklin in London.
Sir John Pringle and Strahan were among Smith&rsquo;s most intimate friends in London.
They were also among the most intimate friends of Franklin.
Much of the additions to the Wealth of Nations during this London period are on colonial or American experience.[233]
Smith always obtained a lot of his information from the conversation of competent men.
Franklin likely was able to contribute something worth learning on such questions.
Franklin&rsquo;s biographer states that=
Smith&rsquo;s papers which belong to this particular period &ldquo;contain sets of problems and queries as though jotted down at some meeting of philosophers for particular consideration at home,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A glance at the index of the Wealth of Nations will show that its author had just that kind of knowledge of the American Colonies which Franklin knew.
There are hundreds of allusions to the Colonies.
Illustrations from their condition and growth occur in nearly every chapter.
The American Colonies constitute the experimental evidence of the essential truth of the book.
Without them, many of its leading positions would be little [Pg 266]more than theory.&quot;[234]
Smith had heard much about the American Colonies during his 13 years in Glasgow from Glasgow&rsquo;s=
intelligent merchants and
returned planters.</p>
<p>After coming to London, Smith seems to have renewed his acquaintance with Lord Stanhope.
Lord Stanhope=
asked Smith who should be the tutor for his ward the Earl of Chesterfield, and
appointed Adam Ferguson on Smith&rsquo;s recommendation.
The negotiations with Ferguson were conducted through Smith.
Some of Ferguson&rsquo;s letters to Smith on this still exist.
But they have nothing interesting for Smith&rsquo;s biography.
Hume was ever anxious to have Smith nearby.
But in contemplation of Ferguson&rsquo;s going abroad with the Earl of Chesterfield,
He tells Smith that Smith should be Ferguson&rsquo;s substitute in the Moral Philosophy chair at Edinburgh during Ferguson&rsquo;s absence.
However, Smith was unwilling to do it.
He strongly opposed professorial absenteeism.
In this case, it was associated with unpleasant circumstances.
The Town Council were the administrators of the College.
They refused to sanction Ferguson&rsquo;s absence.
They told him to stay at home or resign his chair.
Ferguson merely snapped his fingers.
He appointed young Dugald Stewart his substitute and went off.
He quietly remarked that fools and knaves were necessary in the world to give other people something to do.
Hume&rsquo;s letter is as follows= —</p>
<p>St. Andrew&rsquo;s Square, February 13, 1774.</p>
<p>Dear Smith,
You are wrong for never informing me of your intentions.
I am now obliged to write to you on a subject without knowing whether the proposal, or rather Hint, I will give you is absurd or not.
The settlement for Ferguson is [Pg 267] just a very narrow compensation for his class if he loses it.
He wishes to keep it and have a Deputy in his absence.
This scheme appears invidious.
It is really not admissible.
It will strenuously be objected by those in the Town Council who want to fill the vacancy with a friend.
He himself cannot think of one who will make a proper substitute.
The chief difficulty would be removed if you became his substitute or successor.
You would then resign on his return.
This is my own notion.
If you think it is improper, then I shall never tell it to Ferguson.
He deserves this friendly treatment by his friendly conduct of a similar kind towards poor Russell&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>What has happened to Franklyn&rsquo;s conduct?
I do not believe that he is guilty even if I always knew him to be a very factious man.
Of all passions, Faction next to Fanaticism is the most destructive of morality.
I hear that Wedderburn&rsquo;s treatment of him before the Council was most cruel.
What a pity![235]</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s headquarters in London was the British Coffee-House in Cockspur Street.
It was a great Scotch resort in the 18th century.
It was kept by a sister of his old Balliol friend, Bishop Douglas.
She was &ldquo;a woman of=
uncommon talents and
the most agreeable conversation.&rdquo; (Henry Mackenzie)
Wedderburn founded a weekly dining club in this house.
Robertson and Carlyle used to frequent this when they came to town.
Smith would do the same.
For many of his Scotch friends belonged to it=
Dr. William Hunter,
John Home,
Robert Adam the architect, and
Sir Gilbert Elliot.
The following were members=
Goldsmith,
Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Garrick, and
Richard Cumberland.
It was=
predominantly a Scotch club.
an extremely agreeable club. (Carlyle and Richard Cumberland)
The Literary Club of Johnson and Burke and Reynolds was a much more famous club.
But in 1775, Smith was admitted to its membership [Pg 268].
It was at the Turk&rsquo;s Head in Gerrard Street.
He attended their fortnightly dinners.
The only members present on the night of his election were=
Beauclerk,
Gibbon,
Sir William Jones, and
Sir Joshua Reynolds.
Boswell, writing his friend Temple on April 28 1776, immediately after the Wealth of Nations was published, says,
&ldquo;Smith too is now of our club.
It has lost its select merit.&rdquo;
Another member of the club was Dean Barnard
He was the husband of the authoress of &ldquo;Auld Robin Gray.&rdquo;
He appreciates Smith better.
Though he wrote his appreciation before the Wealth of Nations appeared.
His words could convey the impression made by Smith&rsquo;s conversation.
One of the Dean&rsquo;s verses runs=</p>
<p>If I have thoughts and can&rsquo;t express them=
Gibbon shall teach me how to dress them in form select and terse
Jones shall teach me modesty and Greek
Smith how to think,
Burke how to speak, and
Beauclerk to converse.
Smith&rsquo;s conversation seems to have been the conversation of a thinker.
He often lectures rather than talk, but always instructive and solid.
William Playfair is the brother of Professor John Playfair the mathematician.
He says=
&ldquo;Those who were in Smith&rsquo;s company may recollect that even in his common conversation, his order and method=
were beautiful, without any formality or stiffness and
gave a pleasure to all who listened to him.&quot;[236]</p>
<p>Bennet Langton mentions Smith talking in a &ldquo;decisive professorial manner.&rdquo;
Topham Beauclerk initially thought highly of[Pg 269] Smith&rsquo;s conversation.
But afterwards he lost it, for reasons unreported. (Boswell)
If Beauclerk was the model converser of the club, he would probably grow tired of expository lectures, however excellent and instructive. (Dean Barnard)
Garrick gives a more curious criticism.
After listening to Smith one evening, the great player turned to a friend and whispered, &ldquo;What say you to this? eh, flabby, eh?&rdquo;
But whatever may have been the case that evening, Smith&rsquo;s talk was not flabby.
It erred rather in excess of substance.
He had Johnson&rsquo;s solidity and weight, without Johnson&rsquo;s force and vivacity.
Henry Mackenzie was the author of the Man of Feeling.
He talked about Smith soon after his death, with Samuel Rogers=
&ldquo;With a most retentive memory, his conversation was solid beyond that of any man.
I have often told him after half an hour&rsquo;s conversation, &lsquo;Sir, you have said enough to make a book.&rsquo;&quot;[237]
Moreover, his conversation had a wide range.
Smith seldom started a topic of conversation.
Though there were few topics raised on which he was not found contributing something worth hearing. (Dugald Stewart)
Boswell was no very partial witness.
He admits that Smith&rsquo;s talk evinced &ldquo;a mind crowded with all manner of subjects.&rdquo;
Like Sir Walter Scott, Smith has been unjustly accused of habitually abstaining from conversing on the subjects he had made his own.
Boswell tells us that Smith once said to Sir Joshua Reynolds that he made it a rule in company never to talk of what he understood.
Boswell alleges this was because Smith always=
thought of bookmaking and
was afraid of the plagiarist.
But Boswell&rsquo;s facts and explanation cannot be accepted at all.
Men able to converse on a variety of subjects will naturally prefer to converse on those unconnected with their own shop.
Because they go into company for diversion [Pg 270]from their own shop, but it is a question of company and circumstances.
If Smith ever made any such rule as Boswell speaks of, he seems to have honoured it as often by the breach as by the observance.
For when his friends brought round the conversation to his special lines of research, he never seems to have failed to give his ideas quite freely, nay, as may be seen from the remark just quoted from Henry Mackenzie, not freely merely but abundantly—as many as would make a book.
He does not appear to have been a grudging giver in this respect .
Smith remarked &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough left&rdquo; on hearing of Blair&rsquo;s borrowing some of his juridical ideas.
When Sir John Sinclair was writing his History of the Revenue Smith, offered him everything that he had on the subject, printed or manuscript.
If Smith did discuss his own book, chapter by chapter with Franklin, Price, and others, around the time when this remark to Sir Joshua was made, it is most unlikely that he could have thought of setting any churlish watch on his lips in ordinary conversation.
Smith was very fond of talking of subjects remote from his own topics.
He was most entertaining when he gave a loose rein to his speculation on subjects off his own line. (Dugald Stewart)
&ldquo;Smith was not known to=
start a new topic himself.
appear unprepared on those topics introduced by others.&rdquo; (Stewart)
His conversation was most amusing when he let out his genius on the few branches of knowledge which he just had the outlines of.&quot;[238]
One of his defects, was his poor penetration into personal character.
But he was very fond of drawing the character of any person whose name came [Pg 271]up in conversation. (Stewart and Carlyle)
His judgments of personal character were always decided and lively.
But they were generally=
too systematic to be just,
always leaning to charity&rsquo;s side, and
erring by partiality rather than prejudice. (Stewart)
When any one challenged or disputed Smith&rsquo;s opinion of a character, he would=
retrace his steps easily and nonchalantly and
contradict every word he had been saying. (Carlyle)
This is confirmed by the remarks of Smith&rsquo;s other friends.
They incidentally speak of his amusing inconsistencies in private conversation.
He was fond of starting theories and supporting them.
But it is not so easy to explain a man on a theory as to explain some abstract subject on a theory.</p>
<p>His voice seems to have been harsh.
His utterance often stammering.
His manner was often embarrassed, especially among strangers.
But as he warmed to his subject, many writers speak of his=
remarkable animation and
smile&rsquo;s peculiar radiancy.
&ldquo;His smile of approbation, was captivating.&rdquo; (Dr. Carlyle)
&ldquo;In the society of those he loved, his features were often brightened with a smile of inexpressible benignity.&rdquo; (Stewart)</p>
<p>While living in London, Smith and Gibbon, attended Dr. William Hunter&rsquo;s lectures on anatomy,[239]. (one of Hunter&rsquo;s students)
Smith had an opportunity of vindicating the value of the lectures of private teachers of medicine like Hunter against the pretensions to monopoly by the universities.
Smith wrote a long letter to Cullen in September 1774.
Smith defends the most absolute and unlimited freedom of medical education.
He treats the University claims as mere expressions of the craft spirit.
He recognises none of those exceptional features of medical education which have constrained even [Pg 272]the most extreme partisans of economic liberty to approve of government interference.</p>
<p>The letter was occasioned by an agitation in Scotch medical circles against the laxity of certain Scotch universities in conferring their medical degrees, in particular=
St. Andrews and
Aberdeen.
The candidate was not required to=
attend classes or
pass an examination.
But he got the degree by merely=
paying the fees and
producing a certificate of proficiency from two medical practitioners.
No inquiry was instituted into their qualifications .
In London, a special class of agent—the broker in Scotch degrees—sprang up to transact the business.
England was being overrun with a horde of Scotch doctors of medicine who=
hardly knew a vein from an artery, and
had created south of the Border a deep prejudice against all Scotch graduates, even those from the unoffending Universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
A case was brought home even to Edinburgh in 1771.
The offender—one Leeds—had not got his degree from Edinburgh without examination.
But he showed his competency to be so doubtful at the London Hospital.
The governors ordered him to obtain the diploma of the London College of Physicians if he were to continue his work.
He failed to pass this London exam and was deprived of his post.
This case created much sensation in London and Edinburgh.
The Duke of Buccleugh was elected an honorary Fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1774.
He made that body an offer to=
take up the question of examination for medical degrees in Parliament and
try what could be done to remove this reproach from his country.
The College of Physicians then drew up a memorial to Government for the Duke of Buccleugh to present.
They prayed for the prohibition of the universities from granting medical degrees, except honorary ones, to=
any absent person [Pg 273], or
any person without first undergoing a personal examination into his proficiency, and
bringing a certificate of=
having attended for two years at a university where physic was regularly taught, and
having applied himself to all branches of medical study.
They fixed two years because that was the term adopted by the London College of Physicians.
They suggested the appointment of a royal commission of inquiry if Government is not prepared for immediate action.</p>
<p>The Duke of Buccleugh sent the memorial for Adam Smith&rsquo;s consideration.
He asked Smith to write to Cullen his views on the subject.
Smith thought in the following letter=
that it was not very practicable for the public to obtain a satisfactory test of medical efficiency
that it was not practicable if the competition by the private teachers were suppressed
that otherwise the medical examination might become as great a quackery as the medical degree and
that the whole question was a mere squabble between the big quack and the little one.</p>
<p>Dear Doctor— I am sorry to you and to the Duke of Buccleugh for taking so long to write back as I promised.
The truth is that some occurrences which interested me a good deal, and which happened here immediately after the Duke&rsquo;s departure, made me forget a business which interested me very little.
Currently, I see the Scotch universities as the best seminaries of learning in Europe, in spite of all their faults.
On the whole, they are perhaps as unexceptionable as any public university.
All public universities have in their very nature the seeds and causes of negligency and corruption.
I know very well that they can still be amended.
A Visitation (Royal Commission) is the only proper means of [Pg 274] getting them this amendment.
It is an arbitrary tribunal.
Before any wise man applies for such a Visitation to improve what is already very well on the whole, he should know=
Who would be the appointed visitors
What is the plan for reform of those visitors
At present, there are many pretenders to the prudential management of Scotch affairs.
We cannot know anything about those two points=
you nor I
the Solicitor-General, nor
the Duke of Buccleugh.
Currently, it would be extremely unwise to apply for a Visitation to remedy an abuse which is not of great public consequence.
In the future, there might be a better opportunity to apply for a Visitation safely.
An admonition, threatening, or any other method of interfering in a corporate body&rsquo;s affairs is irregular and illegal.
His Majesty nor any of his present Ministers would not do these to obtain more important things than this reform of Scottish degrees.
You propose that no person should be allowed to his exams for his degrees unless he brought a certificate proving that he studied at least two years in some university.
Would not such a regulation be oppressive on all private teachers, such as the Hunters, Hewson, Fordyce, etc.?
The scholars of such teachers surely merit whatever honour or advantage a degree can confer much more than those who have spent many years in some universities.
In those universities, medical knowledge is=
not taught at all, or
taught so superficially that they is not taught well at all.
After a man has learnt his lesson very well, it is surely not so important where or from whom he has learnt it.
This regulation would establish the monopoly of medical education in favour of universities.
It would be hurtful to the lasting prosperity of such bodies corporate.
Monopolists very seldom make good work.
A lecture which must be attended by a certain number of students, whether they profit by it or not, is not likely to be a good one.
I have thought much on this subject.
I have inquired very carefully into the constitution and history of several principal European universities.
The present state of degradation [Pg 275] and contempt of these societies in Europe arises principally from=
The large salaries given to professors in some universities
It renders them independent of their diligence and success.
The many students who must resort to these kinds of societies in order to=
get degrees,
be admitted to exercise certain professions, or
get bursaries, exhibitions, scholarships, fellowships, etc.
whether the instructions which they are likely to receive there are or are not worth the receiving.
All these cases of negligence and corruption take place in all our Scotch universities.
In the best of them, however, these cases take place in a much less degree than in most of other considerable societies of the same kind.
I look on this circumstance as the real cause of their present excellence.
In the Medical College of Edinburgh in particular, professors&rsquo; salaries are insignificant.
There are few or no bursaries or exhibitions.
Their monopoly of degrees is broken in on by all other universities, foreign and domestic.
It is currently acknowledged as superior over every other society of the same kind in Europe.
The practice of signing a certificate in favour of someone we know nothing about is a practice which cannot be strictly vindicated.
However, the most scrupulous men are sometimes guilty of it from=
mere good-nature and
without any kind of interest.
I certainly do not defend it.
Reducing the unhandsomeness of the practice, however, I ask how does the public suffer by it?
You will say that the title of Doctor gives some credit and authority to the man who has it.
It extends his practice and consequently his field for doing mischief.
It probably might increase his presumption and consequently his disposition to do mischief.
This cannot be denied.
But I believe that this effect would be very inconsiderable.
Currently, many people know of the profound secret that Doctors are sometimes fools as well as other people.
The title is not so very imposing.
A man very seldomly trusts his health to another merely because that other is a Doctor.
The person so trusted has almost always some knowledge or some craft which would [Pg 276] procure him nearly the same trust.
Though he was not decorated with any such title.
In fact, those who apply for degrees in the irregular way complained of are mostly surgeons or apothecaries.
They are used to advise and prescribe, that is, to practise as physicians.
But they are only surgeons and apothecaries, so they are not paid as physicians.
It is not so much to extend their practice as to increase their fees that they want to be Doctors.
Degrees conferred even undeservedly on such persons can surely do very little harm to the public.
The University of St. Andrews very rashly and imprudently conferred a degree on one Green who happened to be a stage-doctor.
They brought much ridicule and discredit on themselves.
But how did they hurt the public?
Green still continued to be a stage-doctor.
He probably never poisoned a single man even if the honours of graduation had never been conferred on him.
Stage-doctors do not much excite the faculty&rsquo;s indignation.
More reputable quacks do.
Stage-doctors are too contemptible to be considered as rivals.
They only poison the poor people.
Copper pence are thrown up to them in handkerchiefs.
These could never find their way to a regular physician&rsquo;s pocket.
It is otherwise with quacks.
They sometimes intercept a part of what might have been better bestowed in another place.
Do not all the old women in the country practise physic without exciting murmur or complaint?
If here and there a graduated Doctor should be as ignorant as an old woman, where can be the great harm?
The beardless old woman indeed takes no fees.
The bearded one does.
I strongly suspect that this exasperates his brethren so much against him.
There never was and never will be, a university from which a degree could give any tolerable security that the person on whom it had been conferred was fit to practise physic.
The strictest universities confer degrees only on students of a certain standing.
Their real motive for requiring this standing is that=
the student may spend more money among them and
they may make more profit by him.
When he has attained this standing, though he still undergoes what they call an examination, he will not be refused his degree.
I believe your examination at Edinburgh is perhaps more serious than that of any other European university.
I suspect you are as good-natured as other people when a student takes his exam after he has=
resided [Pg 277]a few years among you,
behaved dutifully to all his professors, and
attended regularly all their lectures.
Several of your graduates, on applying for license from the College of Physicians here, have had it recommended to them to continue their studies.
From a particular knowledge of some of the cases I am satisfied that the decision of the College in refusing them their license was perfectly just—that is, was perfectly agreeable to the principles which ought to regulate all such decisions;
and that the candidates were really very ignorant of their profession.
A degree can pretend to give security for nothing but the science of the graduate; and
even for that it can give but a very slender security.
For his good sense and discretion, qualities not discoverable by an academical examination, it can give no security at all;
but without these the presumption which commonly attends science must render it in the practice of physic ten times more dangerous than the grossest ignorance when accompanied, as it sometimes is, with some degree of modesty and diffidence.
In short, if a degree always has been and always must be a mere piece of quackery, it is for the public&rsquo;s advantage that it should be understood to be so.
For the advantage of the universities, the students=
should be made to depend on=
ttheir merit
their abilities to teach
their diligence in teaching
not on their privileges
should not use any of those quackish arts which have disgraced and degraded half of them.</p>
<p>A degree which can be conferred only on students of a certain standing, is a statute of apprenticeship.
It is likely to contribute to the advancement of science, just as other statutes of apprenticeship have contributed to the advancement of arts and manufactures.
Those statutes of apprenticeship, assisted by other corporation laws, have banished arts and manufactures from most of towns corporate.
Such degrees, assisted by some other regulations of a similar tendency, have banished almost all useful and solid education from most universities.
Bad work and high price have been the effect of the monopoly introduced by statutes of apprenticeship.
Quackery, imposture, and exorbitant fees have been the consequences of the monopoly established by degrees.
The industry of manufacturing villages has partly remedied the inconveniences from the monopolies [Pg 278] by towns corporate.
Some poor universities were inconveniently situated for the resort of students.
The private interest of some poor Professors of Physic in those poor universities has partly remedied the inconveniences from that monopoly which the great and rich universities tried to establish.
The great and rich universities frequently graduated only their own students.
Those students did not even have a long and tedious standing.
Five and seven years for a Master of Arts;
11 and 16 for a Doctor of Law, Physic, or Divinity.
Because of their situation&rsquo;s inconvenience, the poor universities were not able to get many students.
They tried to earn money in the only way they knew.
They sold their degrees to whoever would buy them, generally without=
needing any residence or standing,
subjecting the candidate even to a decent examination.
The less trouble they gave, the more money they got.
I do not pretend to vindicate such a dirty practice.
All universities were ecclesiastical establishments under the Pope&rsquo;s immediate protection.
A degree from one of them gave all over Christendom very nearly the same privileges which a degree from any other could have given; and
To this day, foreign degrees are respected even in Protestant countries.
This respect must be considered as a remnant of Popery.
The facility of obtaining degrees, particularly in physic, from those poor universities had two effects.
Both effects were extremely advantageous to the public, but extremely disagreeable to graduates of other universities whose degrees had cost them much time and expense.
It multiplied very much the number of doctors.
It thereby sunk their fees, or
at least hindered them from rising so very high as they otherwise would have done.
Had the universities of Oxford and Cambridge been able to maintain themselves in the exclusive privilege of graduating all the doctors who could practise in England, the price of feeling the pulse might by this time have risen from two and three guineas to double or triple that sum.
Two and three guineas is the current price.
At the same time, English physicians probably would have been the most ignorant and quackish in the world.
It much reduced the doctor&rsquo;s rank and dignity.
But if the physician was a man of sense and science, it would not surely prevent his being respected and employed as a man of sense and science.
If he was neither the one nor the other, his doctorship would no doubt avail him the less.
But should it in this case to avail him at all?
Had the hopeful project of the rich and great universities succeeded, there would have been no occasion [Pg 279]for sense or science.
To have been a doctor would alone have been sufficient to give any man rank, dignity, and fortune enough.
It is for the public interest that in every profession, the fortune of every person should depend=
as much as possible on his merit and
as little as possible on his privilege.
There are professions which can never effectively support the general merit and real honour of those who exercise it.
It is even for the interest of those kind of professions to have such liberal principles.
Those principles are even most effectual for procuring them all the employment which the country can afford.
The great success of quacks in England has been due to the real quackery of the regular physicians.
Our regular physicians in Scotland=  have little quackery, and no quack accordingly has ever made his fortune among us.</p>
<p>After all, this trade in degrees is a most disgraceful trade.
I am extremely sorry that it should be exercised by respectable bodies like our Scotch universities.
But it is not hurtful to the public because it corrects the exclusive and corporation spirit of all=
thriving professions and
great universities.
This spirit would otherwise grow up to be an intolerable nuisance.</p>
<p>The current hardships of the Edinburgh physicians is perhaps the real cause of their superiority.
You say that the Royal College of Physicians are obliged by their charter to grant a license without examination to all the graduates of Scotch universities.
So I suppose you are all obliged to sometimes consult with very unworthy brethren.
You are all made to feel that you must rest none of your dignity on your degree.
Your degree is a distinction you share with the men whom you might despise the most.
Instead, you must found your dignity on your merit.
You are unable to derive much consequence from the character of Doctor.
You are obliged perhaps to attend more to your character as men, gentlemen, and men of letters.
The unworthiness of some of your brethren might in this way be partly the cause of your very eminent and superior worth.
In this way, the very abuse which you complain of might be the real source of your present excellence.
You are at present wonderfully well.
When you are so, there is always some danger in attempting to be better.
After having delayed to write to you[Pg 280] I am afraid I shall get my lug (ear) in my lufe (hand) for what I have written.
But I ever am, most affectionately yours,
Adam Smith.</p>
<p>London, September 20, 1774.[240]
We do not know whether Smith&rsquo;s unfavourable opinion on the part of his old and venerated tutor changed the Duke of Buccleugh&rsquo;s mind on the subject, or
prevented him from persevering in his contemplated application to Government,
But no further action seems to have been taken in the matter.
It was left to the Scottish universities themselves to remedy abuses which were seriously telling on their own interest and good name.</p>
<p>The last year of Smith&rsquo;s residence in London was overcast by growing anxiety on Hume&rsquo;s condition.
Hume had always enjoyed fairly good health until the start of 1775.
He then seemed to fall rapidly away.
As Smith said one evening at Lord Shelburne&rsquo;s to Dr. Price, who asked him about Hume&rsquo;s health,
It seemed as if Hume was one of those persons who after a certain time of life go down by jumps and not gradually.[241]
Under those circumstances, Smith had determined to go down to Edinburgh as soon as his new book was out.
He would persuade Hume to come back with him to London, for=
a change of scene and
a little wholesome diversion.
But he was a bad correspondent.
He left Hume to gather his intentions from the reports of friends.
He consequently received from Hume the following remonstrance a few weeks before his work&rsquo;s publication=
Edinburgh, February 8, 1776.</p>
<p>Dear Smith—
I am as lazy a correspondent as you, but my anxiety about you makes me write.
By all accounts your book has been printed long ago.
Yet it [Pg 281]has never been advertised.
Why?
If you wait until the fate of Bavaria be decided you may wait long.
By all accounts you intend to settle with us this spring.
Yet we hear no more of it.
Why?
Your room in my house is always vacant.
I am always at home.
I expect you to land here.</p>
<p>I have been, am, and shall be probably in an indifferent state of health.
I weighed myself the other day.
I have fallen five complete stones.
If you delay much longer I shall probably disappear altogether.</p>
<p>The Duke of Buccleugh tells me that you are very zealous in American affairs.
I think this matter is not so important as is commonly imagined.
If I am wrong I shall probably correct my error when I see you or read you.
For navigation and general commerce may suffer more than our manufactures.
Should London fall as much in its size as I have done it will be the better.
It is nothing but a Hulk of bad and unclean Humours.[242]
The American question was the great question of the hour, for the Colonies were already a year in active rebellion.
They issued their declaration of independence a few months later.
Smith followed the struggle with the most patriotic interest and anxiety.
We see this in the concluding portion of the Wealth of Nations.
He made a special study long ago of the whole problem of colonial administration.
He had arrived at the most decided opinions on the rights and wrongs of the issue.
But on the general policy it was requisite to adopt in the government of dependencies.
Hume favoured separation.
He believed separation to be inevitable sooner or later in the ordinary course of nature, like the separation of=
the fruit from the tree or
the child from the parent.
But Smith shun all such misleading metaphors.
He held that=
as long as the mother country and the dependency were wise enough to stay together, there was no need for separation,
the sound policy to adopt was really a closer union—of imperial [Pg 282] federation.
He would not say, &ldquo;Perish dependencies,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Incorporate them.&rdquo;
He would=
treat a colony as a natural expansion of the kingdom&rsquo;s territory, and
have its inhabitants enjoy the same rights and bear the same burdens as other citizens.
He did not think it wrong to tax the Colonies.
On the contrary, he would make them pay every tax the inhabitants of Great Britain had to pay.
But he thought it wrong to put restrictions on their commerce from which the commerce of Great Britain was free.
He thought it wrong to tax them for imperial purposes without giving them full and equal representation in the Imperial Parliament—
&ldquo;bearing the same proportion to the produce of their taxes as the representation of Great Britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon Great Britain.&rdquo;
The union he contemplated was to be more than federal.
It would home rule by local assemblies.
It was to be like the union=
established with Scotland,
which he strongly wanted to see established with Ireland.
The Imperial Parliament in London was to make laws for the local affairs of the provinces across the Atlantic, exactly as it made laws for the local affairs of the province across the Tweed.
He accepted the consequences of his scheme.
He admitted even that when the Colonies grew in population and wealth, the time would come when=
the American members of the Imperial Parliament would outnumber the British, and
the seat of Parliament would be transferred from London to some Constantinople in America.</p>
<p>He knew that this scheme would be thought wild and called a &ldquo;new Utopia.&rdquo;
But he did not think that the old Utopia of Sir Thomas More was useless or unrealistic.
He says that his Utopia is &ldquo;no more useless or chimerical than the old one.&rdquo;
Its difficulties would not come &ldquo;from the nature of things, [Pg 283] but from the prejudices and opinions&rdquo; of the British and Americans.
He held very strongly that a union of this kind was the only way=
to make the Colonies a useful factor instead of a showy and expensive appendage of the empire, and
to prevent their total separation from Great Britain.
He also pleaded for union to=
to save the Colonies to the mother country, and
to save the Colonies to themselves.
Separation merely meant mediocrity for Great Britain.
But for the Colonies, it meant ruin.
There would no longer be any check on the spirit of rancorous and virulent faction which was always inseparable from small democracies.
The mother country&rsquo;s coercive power had prevented the colonial factions from breaking out into anything worse than brutality and insult.
But if that coercive power were entirely taken away, they would probably soon break out into open violence and bloodshed.[243]</p>
<p>The event has falsified the last anticipation.
But this is not the place to criticise Smith&rsquo;s scheme.
We only recalled the ideas which Smith was then so zealously working for in London.</p>
