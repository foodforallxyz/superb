<p>A bankruptcy would probably obviate the necessity of fresh loans; but would not release an atom of the former taxation,
where the interest of the debt is habitually paid, not with the proceeds of taxation, but with new loans. Thus, the burthens
of the people would not be alleviated, 114 nor the charges of production reduced= consequently there would be no sensible
reduction in the price of commodities; nor would British products find a readier market either at home or abroad.
General Fund, whence all Revenue is derivable; consisting of the Total Natural Agency, Capital and Industry, at the command of the Nation, divided into four equal portions, whereof respectively each individual is supposed to possess a share,
proportionate to his Wealth. Of this stock, the only part applicable to the purpose of a National Loan, is the transferable
or floating value, capable of acting as capital.</p>
<p>The classes liable to taxation would be diminished in numerical strength, by the whole of the suppressed stockholders;
and taxation less productive, although not lower in ratio. The 40 millions of revenue, withdrawn from the public creditors,
would pay taxes only upon the annual profit or revenue, they might yield in the character of productive capital. The ruin of
the public creditors would be attended with abundance of collateral distress; with private failures and insolvency without end; with the loss of employment to all their tradesmen and servants, and the utter destitution of all their dependants.</p>

These three portions yield but two of revenue; portion II be-
ing absolutely extinct.
IV. yielding revenue applicable to any purpose.
On the other hand, if she persevere in borrowing to pay the
interest of the former loans, that interest and with it taxation
also, must go on increasing to infinity. It is impossible to avoid
a precipice, when one follows a road that leads nowhere else.

The potentates of Asia, and all sovereigns, who have no hopes
of establishing a credit, have recourse to the accumulation of
treasure. Treasure is the reserve of past, whereas a loan is the
anticipation of future revenue. They are both serviceable ex-
pedients in case of emergency.

A treasure does not always contribute to the political security
of its possessors. It rather invites attack, and very seldom is
faithfully applied to the purpose for which it was destined.
The accumulation of Charles V of France fell into the hands
of his brother, the duke of Anjou; those which pope Paul II
destined to oppose the Turkish arms, and drive them out of
Europe, supplied the extravagancies of Sixtus IV and his neph-
ews. The treasures amassed by Henry IV, for the humiliation
of the house of Austria, were lavished upon the favourites of
the queen-mother= and, at a later period, we have seen the

The cultivation by metayers, the very lowest descrip-
tion of farmers, gives to them, and their subordinate
labourers’ industry, a revenue equal to that of the land
jointly with the capital, which is advanced by the propri-
etor.</li>

<li>This may be illustrated by the burning of fuel in a grate or
furnace. The fuel burnt, serves either to give warmth, or to
cook victuals, boil dyeing ingredients, and the like, and
thereby to increase their value. There is no utility in the
mere gratuitous act of burning, except inasmuch as it tends
to satisfy some human want, that of warmth for instance;
in which case, the consumption is unproductive; or inas-
much as it confers upon a substance submitted to its ac-
tion, a value, that may replace the value of the fuel con-
sumed; in which case the consumption is productive.
If the fuel, burnt for the sake of warmth, produce
either no warmth at all, of very little= or that burnt to give
value to a substance, give it no value, or a less value than
the value consumed in fuel, the consumption will be ill-
judged and improvident.</li>
<li>There is unquestionably a sort of talent requisite in the
expenditure of a large income with credit to the propri-
etor, so as to gratify personal taste, without awakening the
self-love of others; to oblige without the sense of humilia-
tion; to labour for the public good, without alarming indi-
vidual interests. But this kind of talent is referable rather
to the head of practical, whilst its influence upon the rest
of mankind falls within the province of theoretical, moral-
ity.</li>
<li>The raw materials of manufacture and commerce are, the
products bought with a view to the communication to them
of further value. Calicoes are raw material to the calico-
printer, and printed calicoes to the dealer who buys them
For re-sale or export. In commerce, every act of purchase
is an act of consumption and every act of re-sale, an act of
production.</li>
<li>One of the suite of Lord Macartney estimated the saving of
grain in China, by this method alone, to be equal to the
supply of the whole population of Great Britain.</li>
<li>There is almost insuperable difficulty in estimating with
precision the consumption and production of value; and
individuals have no other means of knowing, whether their
fortune be increased or diminished, except by keeping regu-
lar accounts of their receipt and expenditure; indeed, all
prudent persons are careful to do so, and it is a duty im-
posed by law in the case of traders. An adventurer could
otherwise scarcely know whether his concern were gain-
ful or losing, and might be involving himself and his credi-
tors in ruin. Besides keeping regular accounts, a prudent
manager will make previous estimates of the value that
will be absorbed in the concern, and of its probable pro-
ceeds; the use of which, like that of a plan or design in
Notes</li>
<li>Some materials are capable of receiving and discharging
the same kind of value many times over; as linen, which
will undergo repeated washing. The cleanliness given it
by the laundress, is a value wholly consumed on each oc-
casion, along with a part of that of the linen itself.</li>
<li>The values not consumed sooner or later in a useful way
are of little moment; such are provisions spoiled by keep-
ing, products lost accidentally, and those whose use has
become obsolete, or which have never been used at all,
owing to the failure of the demand for them, wherein value
originates. Values buried, or concealed, are commonly
withdrawn but for a time from consumption; when found,
it is always the interest of the finder to turn them to ac-
count, which he cannot do without submitting them to con-
sumption. In this case, the only loss is that of the profit
derivable from them during the period of their disappear-
ance, and may be reckoned equivalent to the interest for
that time.
The same observation applies to the minute savings,
successively laid by until the moment of investment, the
aggregate of which is, doubtless, considerable. The loss,
resulting from this inertness of capital, may be partially
remedied by moderating the duties on transfer, by extend-
ing to the utmost the facility of circulation, and by the
establishment of banks of deposit, in which capital may
be safely vested, and whence it may readily be withdrawn.
In times of political confusion, and under an arbitrary gov-
ernment, many will prefer to keep their capital inactive,
concealed, and unproductive, either of profit or gratifica-
tion, rather than run the risk of its display. This latter evil
is never felt under a good government.</li>

<li>It is probable, that, in all countries, anywise advanced in
industry. the revenues of industry exceed those of capital
and land united, and, consequently, that the consumption
of those deriving income solely from industry, and wholly
dependent for subsistence upon their personal faculties,
exceeds that of both capitalists and landlords together. It
is not uncommon to meet with a manufactory, that, with a
capital, say of 120,000 dollars, will pay daily in wages to
its people, 60 dollars, which, with the deduction of Sun-
days and holidays, makes 18,000 dollars per annum; if to
this be added, 4000 dollars more for the net profits of per-
sonal superintendence and management, it will give a to-
tal of 22,000 dollars per annum, for the revenue of indus-
try alone. The same capital, vested in land at bu 20 years’
257Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
building, is to give an approximation though it can afford
no certainty.</li>
<li>It is strange, that so acute a writer should not have per-
ceived, that the mischief of pure individual vanity can never
be very formidable, because the pleasure it affords loses
in intensity, in proportion to its diffusion. Indeed= as far as
individual consumption is concerned, attacks upon luxury
are mere idle declamations; for the productive energies of
mankind will always be directed towards an object, with a
force and in a degree proportionate to the intensity of the
want for it. It is the extravagance of public luxury alone
that can ever be formidable; this, as well as public con-
sumption of every kind, it is always the interest of the com-
munity at large to contract, and that of public functionar-
ies to expand, to the utmost. Tr.</li>
<li>The lending at interest what might have been spent in
frivolity is of this latter class; for interest can not be paid,
unless the loan be productively employed; in which case
it will go in part to the maintenance of the labouring classes.</li>
<li>By knowledge, I would always be understood to mean,
acquaintance with the true state of things, or generally with
truth in every branch.</li>
<li>In a wholesome state of society, when public institutions
are not needlessly multiplied, and all tend to the common
purpose of public good, this very impatience and anxiety
is conducive to the welfare, and not to the injury, of soci-
ety. Indeed, great inequality of fortune seems to be a nec-
essary accompaniment to social wealth and great national
productive power. It is the prospect of great prizes only,
that can stimulate to the extreme of intellectual and corpo-
real industry; and there is no instance on record of a na-
tion far advanced in industry, in which great inequality of
fortune has not existed. One bishopric of Durham will
tempt more clerical adventurers, than five hundred mod-
erate benefices and the example of a single Arkwright or
Peel will stimulate manufacturing science and activity
more. than a whole Manchester of moderate cotton spin-
ning concerns. Tr.</li>
<li>On this ground sumptuary laws are superfluous and un-
just. The indulgence proscribed is either within the means
of the individual or not= in the former case, it is an act of
oppression to prohibit a gratification involving no injury
to others, equally unjustifiable as prohibition in any other
particular; in the latter, it is at all events nugatory to do so;
for there is no occasion for legal interference, where pe-
cuniary circumstances alone are an effectual bar. Every
irregularity of this kind works its own punishment. It has
been said, that it is the duty of the government to check
those habits, which have a tendency to lead people into
expenses exceeding their means; but it will be found, that
such habits can only be introduced by the example and
encouragement of the public authorities themselves. In all
other circumstances, neither custom nor fashion will ever
lead the different classes of society into any expenses, but
what are suitable to their respective means.</li>
<li>The weaker sex is, from the very circumstance of inferi-
ority in strength of mind, exposed to greater excess both
of avarice and prodigality.</li>
<li>I remember being once in the country a witness of the
numberless minute losses that neglectful housekeeping
entails. For want of a trumpery latch, the gate of the poul-
try-yard was forever open= there being no means of clos-
ing it, Externally, it was on the swing every time a person
went out; and many of the poultry were lost in consequence.
One day a fine young porker made his escape into the
woods, and the whole family, gardener, cook, milk-maid,
&amp;c., presently turned out in quest of the fugitive. The gar-
dener was the first to discover the object of pursuit, and in
leaping a ditch to cut off his further escape, got a sprain
that confined him to his bed for the next fortnight= the cook
found the linen burnt that she had left hung up before the
fire to dry; and the milkmaid, having forgotten in her haste
to tie up the cattle properly in the cow-house, one of the
loose cows had broken the leg of a colt that happened to
be kept in the same shed. The linen burnt and the gardener’s
work lost, were worth full twenty crowns; and the colt about
as much more= so that here was a loss in a few minutes of
forty crowns, purely for want of a latch that might have
cost a few sous at the utmost; and this in a household where
the strictest economy was necessary, to say nothing of the
suffering of the poor man, or the anxiety and other trouble-
some incidents. The misfortune was to be sure not very
serious, nor the loss very heavy; yet when it is considered,
that similar neglect was the occasion of repeated disasters
of the same kind, and ultimately of the ruin of r worthy
family, it was deserving of some little attention.</li>
<li>Stewart, Essay on Pol. Econ. book ii. c. 20. The same
writer has in an other passage observed, that every thing
not absolutely necessary to fire existence is a superfluity.</li>
<li>The English term luxury has a much more sensual mean-
ing than the French luxe, and seems to comprise both luxe
and luxure, the luxus, or luxuria, and luxuries of the Latin
writers.</li>
<li>Though it is not every subject that allows equal scope to
poetical genius, it does not seem, that error affords a finer
field than truth. The lines of Voltaire on the system of the
world, and on the discoveries of Newton regarding the
properties of light, are strictly conformable to the rules of
science, and nowise inferior in beauty to those of Lucretius
on the fanciful dogmas of the Epicurean school. But if
Voltaire had been better acquainted with the principles of
political economy, he would never have given utterance
to such sentiments as the following:
Sachez surtout que le luxe enrichit
Un grand itat, s’il en perd un petit.
Cette splendeur, cette pompe mondaine,
D’un regne heureux est la marque certain.
Le riche est ne pour beaucoup depenser&hellip;.
258Book III= On Consumption
has been advanced; for what is too ridiculous to be
hazarded in such a cause. “That since luxury consumes
superfluities only, the objects it destroys are of little real
utility, and therefore the loss to society can be but small.”
There is this ready answer= the value of the objects con-
sumed by luxury must have been reduced by the competi-
tion of producers to a level with the charges of produc-
tion, wherein are comprised the profits of the producers.
Objects of luxury are equally the product of land, capital,
and industry, which might have been employed in raising
objects of real utility, had the demand taken that direction;
for production invariably accommodates itself to the taste
of the consumers.</li>
<li>Although the capitalist and landholder receive their inter-
est and rent originally in the shape of money, and have,
therefore, no occasion to go through any previous act of
exchange, to obtain wherewithal to pay the tax, yet such a
previous exchange must have been effected by the adven-
turer, who turns the land or capital to account. The effect
is precisely the same, as if the rent or interest had been
paid in kind; that is, in the immediate products of the land
or capital; and the landholder or capitalist had paid the tax
either by the direct transfer of part of those products, or by
first selling them, and afterwards paying over the proceeds.
On this subject, vide supra, Book II. chap. 5, for the mode
in which revenue is distributed amongst the community.</li>
<li>Dr. Hamilton, in his valuable tract upon The National
Debt of Great Britain, illustrates the absurdity of the posi-
tion here attacked, by comparing it to the “forcible entry
of a robber into a merchant’s house, who should take away
his money, and tell him he did him no injury, for the money,
or part of it, would be employed in purchasing the com-
modities he dealt in, upon which he would receive a profit.”
The encouragement afforded by the public expenditure is
precisely analogous.</li>
<li>It is mere usurpation in a government, to pretend to a
right over the property of individuals, or to act as if pos-
sessing such a right; and usurpation can never constitute
right; although it may confer possession. Were it other-
wise, a thief, who had once, by force or fraud, obtained
possession of another man’s property, could never be called
upon to make restitution, when overpowered and taken
prisoner, for he might set up the plea of legitimate owner-
ship.</li>
<li>The reader will readily perceive, that this and many other
passages, were written under the pressure of a military des-
potism, which had assumed the absolute disposal of the
national resources, and suffered no one to express a doubt
of the justice and policy of its acts.</li>
<li>Fenelon, Vauban, and a very few more, of the most dis-
tinguished talent, had a confused idea of the ruinous ten-
dency of this System; but they failed in impressing the rest
of the world with the same conviction; for want of just
notions on the subject of the production and consumption
The progress of science compels those who covet literary
fame, to make themselves acquainted with general prin-
ciples at the least; without a close adherence to truth and
nature, there is little chance of permanent reputation, even
in the poetical department.</li>
<li></li>
<li>There are other circumstances that contribute to veil the
residence of the court in an atmosphere of human misery.
It is there, that personal service is consumed by whole-
sale; and that is of all things the most rapidly consumed,
being, indeed, consumed as fast as produced. Under this
denomination, is to be comprised, the agency of the sol-
diery, of menial servants, of public functionaries, whether
useful or not, of clerks, lawyers, judges, civilians, ecclesi-
astics, actors, musicians, drolls, and numerous other hang-
ers-on, who all crowd towards the focus of power and oc-
cupation, civil, judicial, military, or religious. It is there
also, that material products seem, to be more wantonly
consumed. The choicest viands, the most beautiful and
costly stuffs, the rarest works of art and fashion, all seem
emulous to reach this general sink, whence little or noth-
ing ever emerges.
Yet, if the accumulated values, that are drained from
every quarter of the national territory to feed the consump-
tion of the seat of royalty, were distributed with any re-
gard to equity, they would probably suffice to maintain all
classes in comfort and plenty. Though such drains must
always be calamitous, because they absorb value, and yield
no return, at any rate the local population might be pretty
well off; but it is notorious that wealth is nowhere less
equally diffused. The prince, the favourite, a mistress, or a
bloated peculator, takes the lion’s share, leaving to the sub-
ordinate drones the pittance assigned to them by the gen-
erosity or caprice of their superiors.
The residence of an overgrown proprietor upon his
estate then only tends to diffuse abundance and cheerful-
ness around him, when his expenditure is directed to ob-
jects of utility, rather than of pomp; in which case he is
really an adventure in agriculture, and an accumulator of
capital in the shape of improvements and ameliorations.</li>
<li>[About 140,000 dollars. Some English ladies wear jew-
els of greater value; but some read the passage in Pliny
Quadringenties, instead of Quadragies Sestertium. This
would make the jewels of Paulina worth 1,400,000 dol-
lars; the more probable sum.] American Editor.</li>
<li>In favour of luxury, the following paradoxical argument
259Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
of wealth. Thus Vauban, in his Dixme royale, says, ‘the
present misery of France is attributable, not to the rigour
of the climate, the character of the inhabitants, or the bar-
renness of the soil= for the climate is most favourable, the
people active, diligent, dexterous, and numerous= but to
the frequency and long continuance of war, and the igno-
rance and neglect of economy.’ Fenelon had expressed the
same sentiments in several admirable passages of his
Telemaque, but they passed for mere declamation, as well
they might; for he was not qualified to prove their truth
and accuracy.</li>
<li>When Voltaire tells us, speaking of the superb edifices of
Louis XIV, that they were by no means burthensome to
the nation, but served to circulate money in the commu-
nity, he gives a decisive proof of the utter ignorance of the
most celebrated French writers of his day upon these mat-
ters. He looked no further than the money employed on
the occasion; and, when the view is limited to that alone,
the extreme of prodigality exhibits no appearance of loss;
for money is, in fact, an item, neither of revenue, nor of
annual consumption. But a little closer attention will con-
vince us of the fallacy of this position, which would lead
us to the absurd inference, that no consumption whatever
has occurred within the year, whenever the amount of
specie at the end of it is found to be nowise diminished.
The vigilance of the historian should have traced the 167
millions of dollars expended on the chateau of Versailles
alone, from the original production by the laborious ef-
forts of the productive classes of the nation, to the first
exchange into money, wherewith to pay the taxes, through
the second exchange into building materials, painting, gild-
ing, &amp;c. to the ultimate consumption in that shape, for the
personal gratification of the vanity of the monarch. The
money acted as a mere means of facilitating the transfers
of value in the course of the transaction; and the winding
up of the account will show, a destruction of value to the
amount of 167 millions of dollars, balanced by the pro-
duction of a palace, in need of constant repair, and of the
splendid promenade of the gardens.
Even land, though imperishable, may be consumed
in the shape of the value received for it. It has been as-
serted, that France lost nothing by the sale of her national
domains after the revolution, because they were all sold
and transferred to French subjects; but what became of
the capital paid in the shape of purchase-money, when it
left the pockets of the purchasers? Was it not consumed
and lost.</li>
<li>In the execution of the national military enterprise, two
different values pass through the hands of the government
or its agents= 1. The value paid in taxes by the public at
large= 2. The value received in supplies and services from
the parties affording them. For the first of these no return
whatever is made; for the second, an equivalent is paid in
wages or purchase-money. Wherefore, there it has no
ground for saying that the government refunds with one
hand what is received with the other; that the whole trans-
action is a mere circulation of value, and causes no loss to
the nation; for the government returns but one, where it
receives two; the loss of the other half falls upon the com-
munity at large. Thus, the national, being but the aggre-
gate of individual wealth, is diminished to the extent of
the total consumption of the government, minus the prod-
uct of the public establishment; as we shall presently see
more in detail.</li>
<li>It has been seen in the concluding chapter of Book II that,
inasmuch as population is always commensurate with pro-
duction, the obstruction of the progressive multiplication
of products is a preventive check to the further multiplica-
tion of the human race; and that the waste of capital, the
extinction of industry, and the exhaustion of the sources
of production, amount to positive decimation of those in
actual existence. A wicked or ignorant administration may,
in this way, be a far more destructive scourge, than war
with all its atrocities.</li>
<li>By government, I mean, the ruling power in all its
branches, and under whatever constitutional form; it would
be wrong to limit the term to the executive branch alone;
the first enactment of a law is as much an act of authority,
das its subsequent enforcement.</li>
<li>The consumption of a nation may undoubtedly exceed its
aggregate annual revenue; but we can hardly suppose that
of Great Britain to have done so; for she has evidently
been advancing in opulence, up to the present time, whence
it may be inferred, that her consumption, at the very ut-
most, only equals her revenue. Gentz, who will hardly be
accused of underrating the financial resources of that coun-
try, estimated her total annual revenue at no more than
two hundred millions sterling; Dr. Beeke at two hundred
and eighteen millions, inclusive of one hundred millions
for the revenues of industry. Granting her to have made
some further progress since those estimates were made,
and that her total revenue in 1813 had advanced to two
hundred and twenty-four millions, we are told by
Colquhoun, in his Wealth, Power, and Resources of the
British Empire, that her public expenditure in that year
amounted to one hundred and twelve millions. By this state-
ment it should seem, that her public expenditure then
amounted to the half of the total expenditure of the nation!
Moreover, the expenses of her central government do not
include all her public charges; there are to be added, county
and parish rates, poor rates, &amp;c. &amp;c. The business of gov-
ernment might be conducted, even in extensive empires,
at a charge of not more than one per cent. upon the aggre-
gate of individual revenue; but, to attain this degree of
perfection, a vast improvement is still requisite in the de-
partment of practical policy. [We copy from a Treatise on
the Taxation of the British Empire, by R. Montgomery
Martin, published in London, in 1833, the following note:
260Book III= On Consumption
— “Lord Liverpool said, in 1822, that the annual income
of Great Britain, after making allowances for the reduc-
tion of rents, and the diminution of the profits of trade
since the war, may be stated to be from £250,000,000 to
£280,000,000 sterling. Now if the population of Great
Britain in 1833 be taken in round numbers at 16 millions,
and the average expenditure for each individual be so low
as one shilling per day, or £18 5s. a-year, the annual in-
come would be £452,000,000 and double that sum if the
average expenditure of each individual were taken at two
shillings per day, which would not be an unreasonable cal-
culation= applying the same rule to Ireland, but giving the
average expenditure of each individual so low as sixpence
a-day, on a population of eight millions, the annual in-
come of Ireland would be £73,000,000. Thus the annual
income of the United Kingdom in 1833, is upwards of
£500,000,000 sterling on the lowest computation.” Esti-
mating, on such authority, the annual income of Great Brit-
ain and Ireland at 500 millions sterling, we perceive that
this income, even after the payment of the taxes, enor-
mous as they have been, is much greater now than at any
former period of her history; and there therefore can be no
doubt that a continued augmentation of the national capi-
tal must take place, even in defiance of many obstructions.
The public expenditure, too, of the same kingdom, is in
course of gradual reduction. During the late war, as has
been observed by our author, on the authority of
Colquhoun, the public expenditure of the year 1813
amounted to 112 millions, whereas in 1830 it was about
34 millions, in 1831, 33 millions, and in 1832 not so much
by £100,000 sterling. American Editor.</li>

without the imposition of any additional taxes. He has been
reproached, indeed, with having incurred heavy loans; but
it is obvious, that, so long as he found means to pay the
interest upon them without fresh taxation, they were now-
ise burthensome upon the nation; and that the interest must
have been defrayed by retrenchment of the expenditure.</li>

<li>The expressions, credit is declining, credit is reviving,
are common in the mouths of the generality, who are, for
the most part, ignorant of the precise meaning of credit. It
does not imply confidence in the government exclusively;
for the bulk of the community have no concern with gov-
ernment, in respect to their private affairs. Neither is it
exclusively applied to the mutual confidence of individu-
als; for a person in good repute and circumstances, does
not forfeit them all at once; and, even in times of general
distress, the forfeiture of individual character is by no
means so universal, as to justify the assertion, that credit
is at an end. It would rather seem to imply, confidence in
future events. The temporary dread of taxation, arbitrary
exaction, or violence, will deter numbers from exposing
their persons or their property; undertakings, however
promising and well-planned, become too hazardous; new
ones are altogether discouraged, old ones feel a diminu-
tion of profit; merchants contract their operations; and con-
sumption in general falls off, in consequence of the de-
cline and the uncertainty of individual revenue. There can
be no confidence in future events, either under an enter-
prising, ambitious, or unjust government, or under one,
that is wanting in strength, decision, or method. Credit,
like crystallization, can only take place in a state of quies-
cence.</li>
<li>A mere sketch is all that can be expected in a work like
the present= a complete treatise on government would be
equally appropriate with a survey of the arts, when it be-
came incidentally necessary to touch upon the processes
of manufacture. Yet, either would be a valuable addition
to literary wealth.</li>
<li>This rule must be taken with some qualification. The
habitual largesses of corn, distributed by the emperors to
the people of ancient Rome, were material objects of pub-
lic consumption. So likewise the provisions of all kinds
consumed in hospitals and prisons, and the fireworks used
on occasions of public display or rejoicing, for the amuse-
ment of the people at large.</li>
<li>It should be recollected, however, that they were at no
charge of defence from external attack, except in respect
to the savage tribes of the interior. From the official ac-
count of the receipts and disbursements of the United
States, in the year 1806, presented by Mr. Gallatin, then
Secretary of the Treasury, it appears that the total expen-
diture fell short of twelve millions of dollars. of which
eight millions went to pay the interest of the public debt;
leaving a sum of four millions only for the charge of gov-
ernment, that is to say, the civil, judicial, military, and other
public functions of a population of twelve millions= which
is wholly defrayed by taxes on imports.
[At the period to which our author here refers,
namely, the year 1806, the actual expenditure by the gov-
ernment of the United States, for that year, according to
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, was 15,070,093
dollars 97 cents, and of this amount, according to the same
authority, 8,989,884 dollars 61 cents, was on account of
the extinguishment of the principal and interest of the public
debt. The population of the United States, for the same
year, was only about 6 millions; for, according to the offi-
cial enumerations, the population, in the year 1800, was
5,305,925, and in the year 1810, was 7,239,814. Now the
charges of the government, exclusive of the payment of

the public debt, it will be seen, amounted then to 6,080,209
dollars 36 cents, or an expenditure equal to more than treble
the amount given by our author.
The whole public expenditure of the people of the
United States necessarily embraces the local disbursements
of the different states, as well as the expenditure of the
general government. Of the former, we have, as yet, no
means of presenting our readers with any accurate or offi-
cial account, and we will not venture to indulge in any
loose estimates. Of the latter, however, we are enabled to
furnish a tabular view, extracted from the letter of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to the Chairman of the Committee
of the House of Representatives on Retrenchment, April
9, 1830, and from the subsequent annual Treasury Reports,
which will exhibit an authentic and accurate view of the
receipts and expenditures of the Federal Government, from
the 4th of March, 1789, the period of its commencement,
to the 31st of December, 1832, the last date to which the
accounts have been all made up.
We also subjoin the last official revision of the popu-
lation returns of the several states and territories, accord-
ing to the five enumerations of the years 1790, 1800, 1810,
1820, and 1830.

<li>The Greeks, until the second Persian war, and the Ro-
mans, until the siege of Veii, regularly made their military
campaigns in that interval. Nations of hunters or shepherds,
that pay little attention to the arts, and none to agriculture,
like the Tartars and Arabs, are less circumscribed in time,
and can prosecute their warlike enterprises in any quarter,
that promises booty, and furnishes pasturage Hence the
vast area of the conquests of Attila, Genghis Khan, and
Tamerlane and of the Moors and the Turks.</li>
<li>It has been calculated that every soldier, brought into the
field by Great Britain, during her last war with America,
cost her twice as much as one on the continent of Europe.
And the other charges of warfare must of course be aggra-
vated by the distance in an equal ratio.</li>
<li>This is too generally expressed. Where security from ex-
ternal attack it only to be had by means of a professional
soldiery; the soldier is a productive agent — productive
of the immaterial product, security from external attack,
than which, under certain circumstances, none can be more
valuable. Tr.</li>
<li>Those who deny the progressive influence of human rea-
son must have studied history to very little purpose. The
perfidy and cruelty of war have considerably abated, in
Europe, more than in Asia or America, and most of all
amongst the most polished of the European nations. The
ungenerous character of some recent military enterprises
roused so much public indignation, as to make them recoil
upon the projectors with ruinous violence.</li>
<li>am here speaking of the only sure reliance in an enlight-
ened age. A people, that has nothing to lose by a change of
domination, may defend itself with the most determined
gallantry. The Mussulman will rush on certain destruction,
in defence of a prince and a faith, that are neither of them
worth defending. But political and religious prejudice will
sooner or later fall to the ground; and leave mankind to
seek for some more reasonable object of devotion.</li>
<li>Should the expected success attend the attempt to
naturalise in Europe the flax of New Zealand, which is
greatly superior to that of Europe in the length and deli-
cacy of the fibre, as well as in the abundance of the crop,
it is possibly that fine linen may be produced at the rate
now paid for the coarsest quality; which would greatly
improve the cleanliness and health of the lower classes.</li>

<li>What was denominated an University, under the reign of
Napoleon, was a still more mischievous institution; being,
in fact, but a most expensive and vexatious contrivance,
for depraving the intellectual faculties of the rising gen-
eration, by substituting, in the place of just and correct
notions of things, opinions calculated to perpetuate the
political slavery of their country.

<li>An example occurs to me of a city of France, whose mu-
nicipal administration was both mildly and efficiently con-
ducted before 1789, at a charge of 1000 crowns per an-
num only, but under the imperial government, though it
Most 30,000 fr. (5,580 dollars) afforded no security against
the caprice and arbitrary will of the sovereign.</li>
<li>Several times during the last century the Molinist priest-
hood refused tu execute their clerical duties in favour of
the Jansenists, in spite of all the government could do; on
the pretence, that it was better to obey the divine com-
mand as conveyed by the voice of the Pope, than that of
any human authority. [This inconvenience can arise only
in countries, where there is an exclusive national church,
subjected, in matters of doctrine and discipline, to an in-
dependent or external superior= as in countries embracing
the faith of Rome. But there is another inconvenience, that
has been much dwelt upon by an eminent divine of the
Scottish church; viz., the inconvenience of directing the
attention of the priesthood from its clerical to civil func-
tions, and, by a confusion of such different duties, abridg-
263Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
soms, that casual associations lead mankind astray; and of
such associations, how incalculable is the number arising
from false systems of religion, oppressive forms of gov-
ernment, and absurd plans of education. The consequence
is, that while the physical and mathematical discoveries of
former ages present themselves to the hand of the histo-
rian, like masses of pure and native gold, the truths which
we are here in quest of may be compared to iron, which
although at once the most necessary and the most widely
diffused of all the metals, commonly requires a discrimi-
nating eye to detect its existence, and a tedious as well as
nice process, to extract it from the ore.”
“To the same circumstance it is owing, that improve-
ments in Moral and in Political Science do not strike the
imagination with nearly so great force as the discoveries
of the Mathematician or of the Chemist. When an inveter-
ate prejudice is destroyed by extirpating the casual asso-
ciations on which it was grafted, how powerful is the new
impulse given to the intellectual faculties of man! Yet how
slow and silent the process by which the effect is accom-
plished! Were it not, indeed, for a certain class of learned
authors, who, from time to time, heave the log into the
deep, we should hardly believe that the reason of the spe-
cies is progressive. In this respect, the religious and
academical establishments in some parts of Europe are
not without their use to the historian of the human mind.
Immovably moored to the same station by the strength of
their cables, and the weight of their anchors, they enable
him to measure the rapidity of the current by which the
rest of the world are borne along.”

<li>Under this head, I would include, the fundamental parts
of knowledge in every department, and the familiar in-
struction adapted to each specific calling, respectively; such
as would impart at a cheap rate to the hatter, the metal-
founder, the potter, the dyer, &amp;c., the general principles of
their respective arts. Works of this kind keep up a constant
channel of communication between the practical and theo-
retical branches, and enable them to profit mutually by
each other’s experience.</li>
<li>This can only be true where the demand for such works is
limited. In England, works of instruction are probably
amongst the most profitable to the authors. Tr.</li>
<li>According to the new method, introduced by Lancaster,
and perfected by subsequent teachers, a single master with
very little aid of books, pens, or paper, can rapidly and
effectually teach reading, writing, and vulgar arithmetic,
to five or six hundred scholars at a time. This truly eco-
nomical result is produced, by taking advantage of the
slightest superiority of intelligence of one above another,
and directing the motive of emulation, natural to the hu-
man breast, towards an useful object. A large school is
commonly divided into forms, consisting each of eight
children, as nearly equal in advancement as possible, and
instructed by a child somewhat more advanced, called the
Monitor. These forms again are divided into eight classes;
of which the lowest learns to pronounce the letters of the
alphabet, and to trace their figures rudely with the finger
upon sand spread out upon a flat board; and the highest is
able to write upon paper, and to practise the four rules of
arithmetic. The children of each form are ranged accord-
ing to their progress; and whoever cannot give the answer,
is immediately superseded by a more apt scholar. As soon
as a child is perfected in one class, he is transferred to the
next in degree. The lessons are received, sometimes in a
sitting posture, and sometimes upright, with slates affixed
to the walls. The instruction is thus always accommodated
to the age and faculties of the child; it necessarily arrests
and rewards his attention; and involves that personal ac-
tivity, essential to the infant frame. The whole is conducted
in a single apartment, and usually under the superinten-
dence of a single master or mistress. The general adoption
of this method will probably be for some time, opposed
by custom and prejudice; but its utility and conformity to
the order or nature will ensure its ultimate and universal
prevalence.</li>
<li>I am strongly disposed to say the same of logic. Were
nothing taught, but that is consistent with truth and good
sense, logic would follow of itself as a matter of course:
all the teaching in the world will never make a man a good
reasoner, whose notions and ideas of things are unsound
and erroneous; and, with the foundation of just notions, he
will require no teaching to make him reason well. Just ideas
of things are only to be acquired by attentive examination;
by taking account of every particular concerning them, and
of nothing but what concerns them; which is the object of
all knowledge in general, and by no means of logic alone.</li>
<li>The bad example of a vicious prince is of the most fatal
tendency; it is notorious to all the world, and protected
and abetted by public authority; and it is sure to be re-
flected by the subservience of courtiers to the extreme point
of imitative servility.</li>
<li>At Paris, the limitation of relief afforded by the Hospice
des Incurables, and those of Petites Maisons, of St. Louis,
of Charite, and many others, is of the former kind; the
admissions to the Hotel-Dieu, Bicetre, Saltpetriere, and
Enfans-Trouves, are subject to a limitation of the latter
kind. As the number of applicants duly qualified for ad-
mission in the establishment first mentioned always ex-
ceeds their capacity, the choice must ultimately be decided
by favour or interest.</li>
<li>Yet it is well worth consideration, whether it be not more
to the advantage, both of the state and of its pensioners, to
maintain them at their own homes upon a fixed income, or
to board them out with individuals. The Abbé de St. Pierre,
whose mind was ever actively at work for the public good,
264Book III= On Consumption
has estimated the charge of maintaining the invalids in their
sumptuous establishment at Paris, to be three times as much
as that of their maintenance at their respective homes,
Annales Polit. p. 209.</li>
<li>With all this waste of space in the great roads of France,
there are in none of them either paved or gravelled foot-
ways, passable at all seasons, or stone seats, for the travel-
lers to rest upon, or places of temporary shelter from the
weather, or cisterns to quench the thirst; all which might
be added with a very trifling expense.</li>
<li>Book I. chap. 9.</li>
<li>Book II. chap. 3.</li>
<li>To say, that if the road were not in existence, the charge
of transport could never be so enormous as here suggested,
because the transport would never take place at all, and
people would contrive to do without the objects of trans-
port, would be a strange way of eluding the argument. Self-
denial of this kind, enforced by the want of means to pur-
chase, is an instance of poverty, not of wealth. The pov-
erty of the consumer is extreme, in respect to every object
he is thus made too poor to purchase; and he becomes
richer in respect to it, in pro portion as its price or value
declines.</li>
<li>In lieu of canals, iron rail-roads from one town to another
will probably be one day constructed. The saving in the
cost of transport would probably exceed the interest of the
very heavy expense in the outset. Besides the additional
facility of movement, roads of this kind would remedy the
violent jolting of passengers and goods. Undertakings of
such magnitude can only be prosecuted in countries where
capital is very abundant, and where the government in-
spires the adventurers with the firm assurance of reaping
themselves the profit of the adventure.</li>
<li>Our author seems in this passage to have become a con-
vert to the opinion of Smith, in respect to the civil tribu-
nals of a nation, from which he had expressed his dissent,
in former editions. Though arbitration may be a very good
mode of settling civil suits, where the parties are both anx-
ious to come to a settlement, and indeed is frequently re-
sorted to, and should always be encouraged; yet it is mani-
fest, that there must be a compulsory tribunal for the ob-
stinate, or refractory. And, since security of person and
property is the main object of social institutions, it is but
just, that invasion in a particular instance should be re-
pelled and deterred at the public charge. In strict justice,
the invader should be held to make good the whole dam-
age; and so he is or ought to be, in the shape of costs, fine,
damages, or otherwise. But it is not consistent with equity
that the sufferer should be deterred from pursuing his claim,
by superadding a proportion of the outlay upon the judi-
cial establishments to the charge of wit. nesses and agents,
which he must necessarily advance, and to the risk of in-
ability in the delinquent, even in the event of ultimate suc-
cess. Tr.</li>
<li>What avails it, for instance, that taxation is imposed by
consent of the people or their representatives, if there ex-
ists in the state a power, that by its acts can leave the people
no alternative but consent De Lolme, in his Essay on the
English Constitution, says that the right of the Crown to
make war is nugatory, while the people have the right of
refusing the supplies for carrying it on. May it not be said,
with much more truth, that the right of the people to deny
the supplies is nugatory, when the crown has involved them
in a predicament that makes consent a matter of neces-
sity? The liberties of Great Britain have no real security,
except in the freedom of the press, which rests itself, rather
upon the habits and opinions of the nation, than upon le-
gal enactments or judicial decisions. A nation is free, when
it is bent on freedom; and the most formidable obstacle to
the establishment of civil liberty is the absence of the de-
sire for it.</li>
<li>By the, same reasoning it has been attempted to prove,
that luxury and barren consumption operate as a stimulus
to production. Yet they are less mischievous than taxa-
tion; inasmuch as they redound to the personal gratifica-
tion of the party himself= whereas, to use the expedient of
taxation as a stimulative to increased production, is to re-
double the exertions of the community, for the sole pur-
pose of multiplying its privations, rather than its enjoy-
ments. For, if increased taxation be applied to the support
of a complex, overgrown, and ostentatious internal admin-
istration, or of a superfluous and disproportionate mili-
tary establishment, that may act as a drain of individual
wealth, and of the flower of the national youth, and an
aggressor upon the peace and happiness of domestic life,
will not this be paying as dearly for a grievous public nui-
sance, as if it were a benefit of the first magnitude?</li>
<li>Memoires, liv. xx.</li>
<li>It is hardly necessary to Controvert an opinion, enter-
tained by sovereigns in times past, respecting the property
of their subjects. We find Louis XIV writing in these terms,
professedly for the instruction of his son in matters of gov-
ernment= “Kings are absolute lords naturally possessing
the entire and uncontrolled disposal of all property, whether
belonging to the church or to the laity, to be exercised at
all times with due regard to economy, and to the general
interests of the state.” Œuvres de Louis XIV, Memoires
Hist. A. D. 1666.</li>
<li>In France, before 1789, the average annual consumption
of salt was estimated at 9 lbs. per head in the districts sub-
ject to the gabelle, and at 18 lbs. per head in those exempt
from that impost. De Monthieu, Influence des diver Impots,
p. 141 Thus, taxation in this form obstructed the produc-
tion of ½ of this article in the districts subjected to it, and
reduced to ½ the enjoyment it was capable of affording; to
say nothing of the other mischiefs resulting from it; the
injury to tillage, to the feeding of cattle, and to the prepa-
ration of salted goods; the popular animosity against the
265Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
collectors of tax, the consequent increase of crime and
conviction, and the consignment to the galleys of numer-
ous individuals, whose industry and courage might have
been made available to the increase of national opulence.
In 1804, the English government raised the duties
on sugar 20 per cent. It might have been expected, that
their average product to the public exchequer would have
been advanced in the same ratio; i.e., from £2,778,000 the
former amount, to £3,330,000= instead of which the in-
creased duties produced but £2,537,000; exhibiting an
absolute deficit. Speech of Henry Brougham, Esq., M. P.,
March 13, 1817.
The people of Great Britain might consume French
wines at a very little advance upon the prices of France,
and have the enjoyment of an unadulterated, wholesome,
and exhilarating beverage, costing perhaps a shilling a
bottle. But the exorbitant duty upon this article has re-
duced its import and the product of the duty to a very trifle;
and thus, the sole benefit resulting from the tax to the Brit-
ish nation is, the total privation of a cheap and wholesome
object of consumption.
The two last examples are a sufficient answer to the
objection taken by Ricardo to this passage of my text; on
the ground that taxation is not injurious to production ir
the aggregate, inasmuch as the consumption of the state
itself replaces that of individuals, which is annihilated by
the tax. A tax, that robs the individual, without benefit to
the exchequer, substitutes no public consumption what-
ever. in place of the private consumption it extinguishes.</li>
<li>Of this, a striking instance is given in a work entitled,
Diverses Idées sur la Legislation et l’Administration, par
M. C. St. Paul. One of the principal bankers of Paris hav-
ing died in 1817, the duty on legacies and inheritance was
levied upon the aggregate of his credit-account, and not
upon the balance, after deducting the debits; and this by
virtue of a proviso in the revenue laws, which charges the
duty upon the gross estate of a defunct, and not upon the
residue after the discharge of the outstanding claims. The
danger of fraud upon the revenue in stating the account, is
not sufficient to justify the exaction of more than is fairly
due.
The same department is in the habit of giving no
notice to the executors or other parties, of the payments
falling due, until after the legal time has expired, in the
hope of incurring the penalty of default. The revolution
had abolished this official and fiscal severity; but it was
revived by the imperial government, and has been acted
upon ever since. A clerk or officer has no chance of pro-
motion, unless he shows a disposition on all occasions to
postpone the interests of the public to those of the exche-
quer.</li>
<li>Œuvres de Turgot, tom. i. p. 170. The accounts of the
farmers-general were minutely stated, and rigidly investi-
gated, because the crown participated in their profits.</li>
<li>Essai Pol. sur la Nouvelle Espagne, liv. v. c. 12.</li>
<li>This position is further confirmed by an instance men-
tioned in a letter, addressed in 1785, by the then Marquis
of Lansdowne to the Abbé Morellet, stating, that in re-
spect to the article of tea, the good effect of the reduction
of duty had surpassed all expectation. The amount of sale
had advanced from 5,000,000 lbs to 12,000,000 lbs., in
spite of many unfavourable circumstances. besides which,
smuggling had been so much crippled, that the public rev-
enue had been increased to a degree that astonished every
body.</li>
<li>This doctrine has been combated by Ricardo, in his Prin-
ciples of Political Economy and Taxation. That writer
maintains, that since the amount and the product of indus-
try are always proportionate to the quantum of the capital
engaged in it, the extinction of one branch by taxation must
needs be compensated by the product of some other, to-
wards which the industry and capital, thrown out of em-
ploy, will naturally be diverted. I answer, that whenever
taxation diverts capital from one mode of employment to
another, it annihilates the profits of all who are thrown out
of employ by the change, and diminishes those of the rest
of the community; for industry may be presumed to have
chosen the most profitable channel. I will go further, and
say, that a forcible diversion of the current of production
annihilates many additional sources of profit to industry.
Besides, it makes a vast difference to the public prosper-
ity, whether the individual or the state be the consumer. A
thriving and lucrative branch of industry promotes the cre-
ation and accumulation of new capital; whereas, under the
pressure of taxation, and accumulation of new capital, it
ceases to be lucrative; capital diminishes gradually instead
of increasing; wealth and production decline in conse-
quence, and prosperity vanishes, leaving behind the pres-
sure of unremitting taxation. Ricardo has endeavoured to
introduce the unbending maxims of geometrical demon-
stration; in the science of political economy, there ir. no
method less worthy of reliance.</li>

<li>Under the system of Napoleon, which made civilization
retrograde to this, as well as in most other particulars, the
charges of collection in which must be included the charge
of privation and the irrecoverable arrears, were much more
considerable; but the full extent of the mischief he caused
is not yet ascertained.</li>
<li>Necker reckons the corvee at four millions of dollars only;
but probably he takes account of nothing, but the value
the day-labour exacted; and does not notice the injury re-
sulting from this method of supplying the public necessi-
ties.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, book v. c. 2. It has been objected, that
a progressive scale of taxation presents the disadvantage
of operating as a penalty to deter activity and frugality
266Book III= On Consumption
from the accumulation of capital. But it must be obvious,
that taxation of all kinds subtracts a portion only, and gen-
erally a very moderate portion, of the addition made to the
fortune of an individual; so that every one has a much stron-
ger inducement to invite, than penalty to deter, accumula-
tion. If a person had to pay 40 dollars more in taxes, upon
every addition of 200 dollars to his revenue, still he would
multiply his enjoyments in a larger ratio than his sacri-
fices. Vide what is said in Sect. 4 of the same Chapter, on
the subject of the land-tax of England. Ibid.</li>
<li>This is the reason, why it has been found practicable to
raise the duty on registration to its present high scale. Were
it reduced, the product to the exchequer would probably
be equally great; and the nation would enjoy the benefit of
greater freedom of circulation, besides experiencing less
encroachment upon its capital.</li>
<li>Taxes upon law proceedings are the most grievous and
oppressive that have ever been resorted to, and since the
appearance of Mr. Bentham’s work on Law taxes, no one,
who has read it, can doubt their impolicy. It is said in the
Edinburgh Review (vol. 27, page 358.), “that one day Mr.
Rose, in Mr. Pitt’s presence, took Mr. Bentham aside, and
informed him that they had read the pamphlet-that its rea-
soning was unanswerable-and that it was resolved there
should he no more such taxes.” “Yet Budget after Bud-
get,” remarks the reviewer, “has since been formed, in
which those duties have made a part; and Mr. Pitt himself
was found to patronize them upon his return to office in
1804.” All the arguments ever brought forward in support
of this objectionable impost, have been triumphantly re-
futed by Mr Bentham, in this work, which it is said in the
same Review, “for closeness of reasoning, has not per-
haps been equalled,!nd for excellence of style, has cer-
tainly never been surpassed.”

<li>In both England and France, premiums are given upon
the importation of specific raw materials, with a view to
encourage manufacture. This is an error on the opposite
side. Upon this principle, instead of a tax on the product
of land, a bounty should be given to all who would take
the trouble to cultivate, for domestic agriculture furnishes
the raw material of most manufactures; as grain in par-
ticular, which is transformed, through the mediation of
human exertion, into value of various kinds, exceeding
that consumed in the process. Customs or duties of import
upon any article whatever are equally equitable with di-
rect taxes upon land; both are positive evils; but the lighter
the tax, the matter the injury.</li>
<li>When it is absolutely necessary to lay a tax upon a par-
ticular kind of consumption or industry, which it is desir-
able not to extinguish altogether, the burthen must be light
in the commencement, and increased gradually and cau-
tiously. But if it be desired to repress or annihilate a mis-
chievous class of consumption or industry, the full weight
of the tax should be thrown upon it at once.</li>
<li>The efficacy of the characteristics of punishment has been
placed beyond all doubt by Beccaria, in his tract, Dei delitti
e delle pene.</li>
<li>This species of tax is still more iniquitous, because it must
fall either upon orphans. or upon parents, who are dis-
posed to submit to personal privations, for the purpose of
rearing valuable citizens; because it is heavier in propor-
tion to the number of children, and the degree of privation
of the parent; and because it is disproportionate to the
means of the individual, poor and rich being taxed alike.
A parent of moderate fortune, with one son only, pays as
much to the university as all the rest of his taxes together:
if he have more sons than one, he is still worse off. Thus
was this institution converted by the usurper into an in-
strument of fiscal extortion, sufficient of itself to have in-
sured the relapse into barbarism, even had it never been
made the medium of instilling false ideas or habits of ser-
vility. The pretext, of making the profits of private estab-
lishments contribute to the expense of compulsory tuition,
is by no means satisfactory. Supposing the tuition of the
public Lycées to be, of all others, the best calculated to
train up useful citizens; and, admitting the justice of com-
pelling a father, or a teacher to his choice, to bring his
pupil to the lectures of the authorized professors, still the
parties, least in need of this instruction, are those already
placed in private establishments of education, and entrusted
to teachers of their own selection. It may be for the inter-
est of the community at large, to dispense particular classes
of learning gratuitously; but it is the greatest oppression to
force learning upon individuals, and make them pay dear
for it into the bargain. If any one class in particular ought
to defray the charge of moderate gratuitous tuition, it is
that, which has no children of its own, and is in the/recep-
tion of all the benefits of social life, without being subject
to all its burthens.</li>
<li>Lotteries and games of hazard, besides occupying capital
unprofitably, involve the waste of a vast deal of time, that
might be turned to useful account, and this item of expen-
diture can never redound to the profit of the exchequer.
They have the further mischievous effect of accustoming
mankind to look to chance alone for what their own tal-
ents or enterprise might attain; and to seek for personal
gain, rather in the loss of others, than in the original sources
of wealth. The reward of active energy appears paltry be-
side the bait of a capital prize. Moreover, lotteries are a
sort of tax, that, however voluntarily incurred, falls almost
wholly upon the necessitous; for nothing, but the pressure
of want can drive mankind to adventure, with the chances
manifestly against them. The sums thus embarked are, for
the most part, the portion of misery, or. what is worse, the
fruit of actual crime.</li>
<li>Not because they affect the tax-payer indirectly; for this
circumstance is equally applicable to many items of direct
267Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
taxation; as, for instance, to the license-tax (patentes) part
of which falls indirectly upon the consumer, who buys of
he licensed dealer.</li>
<li>Vide Examination of B. Franklin, at the bar of the House
of Commons, 1767. Memoirs, vol. i. Appendix 6. [The
denial went to the whole of what is called internal taxa-
tion; the admission, which appears on the part of the Ameri-
can agents to have been a concession for the sake of peace,
went no farther than to external taxes for the regulation of
trade. And even this concession on the part of some of the
agents was very soon retracted, and the right of taxation
denied in toto. Ibid. vol. i. passim Tr.]</li>

to Arthur Young, the stamp-duties in his time cost but

which is less than a per cent.</li>
<li>Supra, Book II. chap. I.</li>
<li>The position, that the interest of the capitalist and the rent
of the landlord are thereby lowered, however paradoxical
it may appear, is nevertheless quite true. It may be asked,
why should the capitalist, who makes the advance to the
manufacturer, or the landlord, whose land he occupies,
lower their demands, in consequence of a portion of the
product being subtracted by taxation? But is no allowance
to be made for consequent delay of payment, claims of
allowances, failures, and legal expenses? All, or at least a
portion, of which must fall upon the landlord and capital-
ist= and often without any suspicion on their part, that they
are thus made to participate in the burthen. In a complex
social organization the pressure of taxation is often im-
perceptible.
This shows the danger of adherence to invariable principle;
and of abandoning the experimental method of Smith, and
constructing a system of theoretical deduction, as some
recent English writers have done, in imitation of the econo-
mists of the last century.</li>
<li>Vide Supra, Book I. chap. 4. for the explanation of the
mode, in which the land-holder concurs in production by
the advance of his land; and must, therefore, be included
amongst the productive classes.</li>
<li>The cultivation need never be abandoned altogether, un-
til taxation takes more than the whole surplus product ap-
plicable to the payment of rent; it is then worth nobody’s
while to cultivate at all; for not only could the proprietor
receive nothing, the whole being appropriated by the state;
but the farmer would be compelled to pay to the state a
higher rent, than he could afford.</li>
<li>There is this peculiarity attending the products of agricul-
tural industry, viz., that their average price is not raised by
growing scarcity, because population is sure to decline co-
extensively with the declining supply of human aliment;
so that the demand necessarily diminishes equally with
the supply. Thus it is not found, that wheat is dearer in
those countries where great part of the land is thrown out
of tillage, than where it is all in a high state of cultivation.
In Spain, wheat is not now dearer, than in the time of
Ferdinand and Isabella, though it is there produced in much
less abundance; for the number of mouths to be fed is also
much less. On the contrary, the lands of both England and
France were less cultivated in the middle ages than at the
present day; and their product of grain less abundant; yet
it does not appear, from a comparison of other values, that
it was then much dearer than at present. The product and
the population were both greatly inferior; and the slack-
ness of demand counterbalanced the slackness of supply.</li>
<li>It is a mistake to suppose, that the tax must bear equally
upon the proprietor and the farmer, who finds the requi-
site capital and industry; for taxation can have no effect,
either in reducing the quantity of land capable of cultiva-
tion, or in multiplying the number of farmers, able and
willing to undertake it; and, if neither supply nor demand
in this branch be varied, the ratio of the rent must needs
remain unaltered likewise.</li>
<li>The economists were quite correct in their position, that a
land or territorial tax falls wholly upon the net product,
and consequently, upon the proprietors; but they were
wrong in extending the doctrine so far as to assert, that all
other taxes were defrayed out of the same fund.</li>
<li>The French institute, which awarded the prize of merit to
an Essay of M Canard, in support of this doctrine.</li>
<li>The duty on the import of cotton into France was, in 1812,
as high as 200 dollars per bale, one bale with another. There
were several manufactories averaging a consumption of
two bales per day; and as the amount of duty was a dead
outlay, during the whole interval between the purchase of
the raw material and the realization of the manufactured
product, which may be taken at twelve months, they must
each have required an additional capital of 120,000 dol-
lars more than would have been requisite but for the tax;
the interest of which they must have charged to the con-
sumer, or have paid out of their own profits. The whole of
it was so much addition of price to the French consumer,
and aggravation of the pressure of taxation, unproductive
of a single additional dollar to the public revenue. The
heaviest of the national burthens of that period were those
that made the least figure in the annual budget of the min-
istry’ the people suffered, in very many instances, without
knowing the nature of the grievance, as in the example,
just cited.</li>
<li>Book II. chap. 3.</li>
<li>For the reason already stated, viz., that purchases, made
with the proceeds of taxation, are acts of exchange, and
not of restitution.</li>
<li>This ground of apprehension is certainly just. It has been
doubted by many political theorists, whether the total re-
mission of taxation would operate to improve the condi-
tion of the inferior productive classes= inasmuch, as all
that is now paid into the public exchequer, would quickly
268Book III= On Consumption
be appropriated by the classes, who should happen to be
in possession of those sources and means of production,
which are capable of exclusive appropriation; and the
owners of mere personal agency would nowise benefit.
But it should be observed, that private persons have an
immediate personal interest in making the most of their
property; and will, on their own account, so conduct them-
selves, as to promote their own advantage, which is the
advantage of the public also, where equality of personal
right prevails. Wherefore, the strongest impulse of private
cupidity can never operate to retard the advance of pro-
ductive power and national wealth, or to make them retro-
grade; but just the contrary. Thus, although the present
condition of the mere labourer might not be improved, his
means of bettering his condition would be enlarged, by
the growing increase of wealth, and by greater freedom of
personal agency. The extortion of private cupidity, unaided
by authority, must, for its own sake, regulate itself by the
ability of the object of it= but that of public authority is
inexorable, and is restrained by no consideration of im-
mediate personal interest. Besides, personal suffering,
occasioned by the hard-heartedness of primate task-mas-
ters, is not so strong an incentive of odium against public
authority, as where that authority is itself the ostensible
task-master. Tr.</li>

<li>The transferable nature of these securities does not in-
vest them with the properties of money, since they do not
act in that capacity. But the use of convertible paper, as
money, operates to create a positive addition to the total
national capital, because, but for their agency in the trans-
fer of value in general It must be executed by specie, or
some equally substantial item of capital. Government de-
bentures of stock require money to circulate them, instead
of acting themselves as money.</li>
<li>In a note, here subjoined, the author stated the amount
of the British national debt, in the year 1815, on the au-
thority of a speech made in parliament in February, of that
year, by the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Vansittart.
We now have it in our power, in place of the note in ques-
tion, to furnish the reader with an exact statement of the
British national debt, from its commencement, at the revo-
lution of 1688, to the 5th of January, 1832. The abstract
we give is extracted from the Tables to Part II of “Pebrer
on the Taxation, Debt, Capital, Resources, &amp;c., of the
whole British Empire,” a work which we before had occa-
sion to refer to, and of the highest statistical authority.
