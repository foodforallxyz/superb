                        <ol>
<li>My brother, Louis Say of Nantes, has attacked this position in a short tract &ldquo;Principales Causes de la
Richesse et de la Misère des Peuples et des Particuliers&rdquo;, 8vo. Paris. Deiterville.</li>
</ol>
<p>He lays down the maxim, that objects are items of wealth,, solely in respect of their actual utility, and not of their admitted or recognised utility.</p>
<p>In the eye of reason, his position is certainly correct; but in this science relative value is the only guide. Unless the
degree of utility be measured by the scale of comparison, it is left quite indefinite and vague, and, even at the same
time and, place, at the mercy of individual caprice.</p>
<p>The positive nature of value was to be established, before political economy could pretend to the character of a science, whose province it is to investigate its origin, and the consequences of its existence.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the earlier editions of this work, I had described the measure of value to be the value of the other product, that was the point of comparison, which was incorrect. The Nor will capital alone suffice to set in motion the mass of industry and the productive energy necessary to the formation and aggrandizement of a city, unless it present also the
advantages of locality and of beneficent public institutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>quantity and not the value of that other product, is the
measure of value in the object of valuation. This mistake
gave rise to much ambiguity of demonstration, which the
severity of criticism, both fair and unfair, has taught me to
correct.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>When commodities are exchanged for money, the case is nowise varied. No seller ever lakes money for his
own consumption, or for any other purpose, than as an object of a second exchange; so that, in reality, the prod-
uct sold is exchanged for the product bought with the price.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a bushel of wheat has been sold for dollar, and 7 lbs. of coffee bought with that dollar, the wheat has actu-
ally been bartered for the coffee, and the money that has
intervened has withdrawn itself as completely, as if it had
never appeared at all in the transaction. Wherefore it is
quite correct to say, that relative value is determined by
the relation of commodities one to another, and not solely
by that of each commodity to money.
4. It must not be inferred from this passage, that I mean to
say, that the productive agency exerted in raising a prod-
uct, whose charges of production have amounted to a dol-
lar, although it is saleable for 75 cents only, is therefore
worth but 75 cents. My position merely implies, that this
amount of productive service has, in such case, raised a
value of 75 cents only, though it might have raised a value
of a dollar.</p>

<li>
<p>Hence the futility of any attempt to compare the wealth of
different nations, of France and England for instance, by
comparison of the value of their respective national prod-
ucts. Indeed, two values are not capable of comparison,
when placed at a distance from each other. The only fair
way of comparing the wealth of one nation with that of
another, is, by a moral estimate of the individual welfare
in each respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And will be so for the most part, though not entirely, wher-
ever the members of the community have no other hope of
subsistence, than from the product of their own produc-
tive means; for the whole surplus of revenue thus created,
is sure to go, in the end, to the appropriators of the natural
sources of production; leaving those, whose productive
means are merely personal, to employ them upon some
other object, or upon an enlarged production of the same
object. And this is a complete answer to the position of
Sismondi and Malthus, that economy of human produc-
tive exertion makes the multiplication of unproductive
consumers, not only probable, but necessary. But where a
poor-law or monastic establishment provides for the sub-
sistence of the human agency thus rendered superfluous,
there will probably be no increase of national revenue con-
sequent upon a saving of productive agency; for the sur-
plus labour is thereby released from the necessity of exer-
tion in some other channel. With such institutions, the en-
largement of productive power by machinery or otherwise
may be very great, without any enlargement of national
production, revenue, or wealth. Tr.</p>

<p>The cost of production is what Smith calls the natural
price of products, as contrasted with their current or mar-
ket price, as he terms it. But it results from what has been
said above, that every act of barter or exchange, among
the rest even that implied in the act of production, is con-
ducted with reference to current price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the last hundred years, the improvements of in-
dustry, effected by the advance of human knowledge, more
especially in the department of natural science, have vastly
abridged the business of production, but the slow progress
in moral and political science, and particularly in the branch
of social organisation, has hitherto prevented mankind from
reaping the full benefit of those improvements. Yet it would
be wrong to suppose they have reaped none at all. The
pressure of taxation has indeed been doubled, tripled, or
even quadrupled; yet population has increased in most
countries of Europe; which is a sign, that a portion at least
of the increase of products has fallen to the lot of the sub-
ject; and the population, besides being augmented, is like-
wise better lodged, clothed and conditioned and I believe
better fed too, than it was a century ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I find in the Recherches of Dupre de Saint Maur, that in
1342, an ox was sold from 10 to 11 livres tournois. This
sum then contained 7 oz. of fine silver, which was worth
about 28 oz. of the present day; and 28 oz. of our present
money are coined into 171 fr. 30 c., (32 dollars,) which is
lower than the price of an ordinary ox. A lean ox bought in
Poitou for 300 fr., and afterwards fatted in Lower
Normandy, will sell at Paris for from 450 to 500 fr. (84 to
93 dollars.) Butcher’s meat has, therefore, more than
doubled in price since the 14th century; and probably most
other articles of food likewise; and, if the labouring classes
had not at the same time been greatly benefited by the
progress of industry, and put in possession of additional
sources of revenue, they would be worse fed than in the
time of Philip of Valois.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be easily explained. The growing revenues
of the industrious classes have enabled them to multiply,
and consequently to swell the demand for all objects of
food. But their supply can not keep pace with the increas-
ing demand, because, although the same surface of soil
may be rendered more productive, it can not be so to an
indefinite degree; and the supply of food by the channel
of external commerce, is more expensive than by that of
internal agriculture on account of the bulky nature of most
of the articles of aliment.
13. Our data in relation to the products of former times are
too few to enable us to deduce from them any precise re-
201Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
sult; but those at all acquainted with the subject will see,
that, whether over or under-stated, will make no differ-
ence in the reasoning. The statistic researches of the present
generation will provide future ages with more accurate
means of calculation, but will add nothing to the solidity
of the principles upon which it must be made.
14. Of this nature are the evil effects of taxation, (especially
if it be exorbitant) upon the general wealth of the commu-
nity, independently of its effects upon the individual as-
sessed. The cost of production, and consequently the real
price of commodities, are aggravated thereby, and their
aggregate value diminished.
15. I have met with persons, who imagined themselves add-
ing to national wealth, by favouring the production of ex-
pensive, in preference to that of cheaper articles. In their
opinion, it is better to make a yard of rich brocade than
one of common sarsenet. They do not consider, that, if the
former costs four times as much as the latter, it is because
it requires the exertion of four times as much productive
agency, which could be made to produce four yards of the
latter, as easily as one of the former. The total value is the
same; but society derives less benefit; for a yard of bro-
cade makes fewer dresses than four yards of sarsenet. It is
the grand curse of luxury, that it ever presents meanness in
company with magnificence.
16. Dupont de Nemours (Physiocratie. p. 117.) says, that “it
must not be supposed, that the cheapness of commodities
is advantageous to the lower classes; for the reduction of
prices lessens the wages of the labourer, curtails his com-
forts, and affords him less work and lucrative occupation.”
But theory and practice both controvert this position. A
fall of wages, occasioned solely by a fall in the price of
commodities, does not diminish the comforts of the
labourer, and, inasmuch as the low price of wages enables
the adventurer to produce at a less expense, it tends pow-
erfully to promote the vent and demand for the produce of
labour.
Melon, Forbonnais, and all the partisans of the ex-
clusive system, or balance of trade, concur with the econo-
mists in this erroneous opinion; and it has been re-affirmed
by Sismondi, in his Nouveaux Prin. d’Econ. Pol. liv. iv. c.
6., where the lower price of products is treated as an ad-
vantage gained by the consumer upon the producer, in
despite of the obvious impossibility of any loss to the
labouring or other productive classes, by a reduction tan-
tamount only to the saving in the cost of production.
17. The Earl of Lauderdale published in 1807, a work, en-
titled, Researches on the Nature and Origin of Public
Wealth, and on the Causes which concur in its Increase;
the whole reasoning of which is built on this erroneous
proposition, that the scarcity of a commodity, though it
diminish the wealth of society in the aggregate, augments
that of individuals, by increasing the value of that com-
modity in the hands of its possessors. Whence the author
deduces the unsound conclusion. that national, differs in
principle from individual wealth. He has not perceived,
that, whenever a purchaser is obliged to make the acquisi-
tion by the sacrifice of a greater value, he loses just as
much as the seller gains; and that every operation, designed
to procure this kind of benefit, must occasion to one party
a loss, equivalent to the gain of another.
He likewise refers this imaginary difference between
the principle of public and of private wealth to this cir-
cumstance; that the accumulation of capital, which is an
advantage to individual, is detrimental to national wealth,
by obstructing the consumption, which is the stimulus of
industry. He has fallen into the very common error of sup-
posing, that capital is, by accumulation, withdrawn from
consumption; whereas, on the contrary, it is consumed,
but in a re-productive way, and so as to afford the means
of a perpetual recurrence of purchase, which can occur
but once in the case of unproductive consumption. Vide
Book III infra. Thus it is, that a single error in principle,
vitiates a whole work. The one in question is built upon
this unsound foundation; and, therefore, serves only to
multiply, instead of reducing the intricacies of the subject.
[The error of Lauderdale is analogous to that of Sismondi
and of Malthus, and arises from the notion, that an exten-
sion of productive power makes all extension of unpro-
ductive consumption necessary; whereas, it is thereby ren-
dered possible, or at the utmost probable only. The state,
as well as its subjects, may consume in a way conducive
to the further extension of productive power, and the state,
like an individual, is powerful and wealthy in proportion
to the extent of the productive sources in its possession,
and to the fertility of those sources. Tr.]

been successfully directed to this grand object, and then
he would have left the reputation of having contributed to
civilize, enrich, and people the world; and not of having
been its scourge and devastator. When the Barbary shore
shall be lined with peaceful, industrious, and polished in-
habitants, the Mediterranean will be an immense lake, fur-
rowed by the commerce of the wealthy nations, peopling
its shores on every side.

21. The increased intensity of the demand for silver com-
pared with its supply, consequent upon the discovery of
America, is stated at 2, to 1, because, but for this increase
of demand, the tenfold supply would have reduced its value
to one-tenth of what it had been previously to that event,
and given to 100 oz. the value of 10 oz. only. But 100 oz.
were only reduced to one-fourth of their former value, i.e.,
to the value of 25 oz.; which bears to 10 oz. the ratio of 22
to 1. This could not have been the case, unless the demand
for silver, compared with the supply, had advanced in that
202Book II= On Distribution
proportion. But the supply having increased tenfold in the
same interval, if we would find the ratio of the actual in-
crease of the demand for silver, whether for the purposes
of circulation, of luxury, or of manufacture, since the first
discovery of the American mines, we must multiply 2½
by 10, which will give 25. And probably this estimate will
not exceed the truth, although 25 times may seem a prodi-
gious advance. However, it would doubtless have been
infinitely less considerable, but for the influx of supply
from America; for the excessive dearness of silver would
have greatly curtailed the use of it. Silver plate would prob-
ably be as rare as gold plate is now; and silver coin would
be less abundant, because it would go further, and be of
higher value.

23. If we are to believe Ricardo, the increase of demand has
no effect upon value, which is determined solely by the
cost of production. He seems not to have perceived, that it
is demand that makes productive agency an object of ap-
preciation. A diminution of the demand for silver bullion
would throw all those mines out of work, of which the
lower scale of price was not adequate to tile charges of
bringing the product to market.
24. In a poor country, after a dealer has disposed of his wares,
he is sometimes a long while before he can provide him-
self with the returns he has in view; and, during the inter-
val, the money proceeds remain idle in his hands. More-
over, in a poor country, the investment of money is always
difficult. Savings are slow and gradual, and are seldom
turned to profitable account, until after a lapse of many
years; so that a great deal of money is always lying by in a
state of inaction.
25. Ricardo, whom I look upon as the individual in Europe
the best acquainted with the subject of money, both in
theory and in practice, has shown, in his Proposal for an
economical and secure Currency, that, when the good
government of the state may be safely reckoned upon, paper
may be substituted for the whole of a metallic money; and
a material possessed of no intrinsic value by skilful man-
agement, be made to supplant a dear and cumbrous one,
whose metallic properties are never called into play by the
functions of money.

sumption of Birmingham and other towns has greatly in-
creased since the date of that work. [Mr. Jacobs, in his
work on the precious metals, to which we have already
had occasion to refer, has shed much light on the con-
sumption, as well as on the production, of gold and silver,
both before and since the discovery of the American con-
tinent. His twenty-sixth chapter is devoted to an inquiry
into the consumption of the precious metals from 1810 to
1830. This chapter abounds with highly instructive and
curious details, which it would be here impossible to
present, but which furnish the grounds of the following
statements, also taken from the same chapter, and which
fully demonstrate the great increase in the consumption of
gold and silver, in what our author, in this note, calls “the
manufacturing consumption,” since the date of Dr. Adam
Smith’s work on the Wealth of Nations, to which he re-
fers.
According, then, to Mr. Jacobs, the annual consump-
tion of the precious metals, from 1810 to 1830, in their
application to ornamental and luxurious purposes, he esti-
mates as follows:

28. We are assured by Humboldt, that the produce of the mines
of Mexico has, in the last 100 years, been increased in the
ratio of 110 to 25; also, that such is the abundance of sil-
ver ore, in the chain of the Andes, that, reckoning the num-
ber of veins either worked superficially, or not worked at
all, one would be led to imagine, that Europe has hitherto
had a mere sample of their incalculable stores. Essai Pol.
sur la N. Espagne, 8vo. tom. iv. p. 149.
The very slight and gradual depreciation of gold and
silver, effected by their immense and increasing annual
supply, is one amongst many proofs of the rapid and gen-
eral advance of human wealth, whereby the demand is made
to keep pace with the supply. Yet I am inclined to think,
that their value, after remaining nearly stationary for a cen-
tury, has within the last thirty years begun again to de-
cline. The setier of wheat, Paris measure, which was for a
long time, on an average, sold for 4 oz. of silver, has now
risen to 4½ oz., and rents are raised upon every renewal of
lease. All other things seem to be rising in the like propor-
tion= which indicates, that silver is undergoing a deprecia-
tion of relative value.
[In a former note we referred to the great decline,
since the year 1809, in the productiveness of the whole
mines, both in this and in the eastern continent, on the
authorities which Mr. Jacobs has given, in his learned work
on the precious metals. From the same work, we here ex-
tract his concluding observations of the twenty-sixth chap-
ter, in relation to the stock of coin now in existence, by
which it will appear, that during the twenty years from
1810 to 1830, the diminution of gold and silver coin
amounted to nearly one-sixth part of the whole stock.
“We have estimated,” says Mr. Jacobs, “the stock of
coin in existence at the end of the year 1809 to have been
203Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
consists; and for that purpose to have a just and enlarged
conception of the agents of production, and of the service
they are capable of yielding.
31. In the above instance of the watch, many of the artisans
are themselves the adventurers in respect to their own in-
dustry; in which case their receipts are profits, not wages.
If the maker exclusively of the chain himself, buys the
steel in its rude state, works it up, and sells the chain on
his own account, he is the adventurer in respect to this
particular part of the manufacture. A flaxspinner buys a
few penny-worth of flax, spins it, and converts her thread
into money. Part of this money goes to the purchase of
more flax; this is her capital; another portion is spent in
satisfying her wants; this is the joint profit of her industry
and her little capital, and forms her revenue.
32. Even that portion of the gross value, which is absorbed in
the maintenance or restoration of the vested capital or
machinery. If his works need repairs, which are executed
by the proper mechanic, the sum expended in them forms
the revenue of that mechanic, and is to the clothier a simple
advance, which is refunded, like any other, by the value of
the product when completed.
33. Part of the value created is due to natural agency, amongst
which that of land is comprised. But, as stated above in
Book I, land is treated as a machine or instrument, and its
appropriator as the producer that sets it in motion; in like
manner as the productive quality of capital is said to be
the productive quality of the capitalist to whom it belongs.
Mere verbal criticism is of little moment, when once the
meaning is explained; it is the correctness of the idea, and
not of the expression, that is material.
34. The term national revenue, has been sometimes incor-
rectly applied to the financial receipts of the state. Indi-
viduals, indeed, pay their taxes out of their respective rev-
enues; but the sum levied by taxation is not revenue, but
rather a tax upon revenue, and sometimes unhappily upon
capital too.
35. Their profit arises from increase of value effected by the
transport upon both the export and the import, by the time
they have reached their destination respectively.
36. I speak here of the adventurers, masters, or tradesmen;
the mere labourer or journeyman benefits only, as it were,
by re-action. The farmer, who is an adventurer in agricul-
ture, employed in raising products for human sustenance,
lies under disadvantages, that very much curtail his prof-
its. His concerns are too much at the mercy of his land-
lord, and of the financial exactions of public authority, to
say nothing of the vicissitudes of seasons, to be very gain-
ful on the average.
37. The reasoning of this whole chapter is superfluous and
inconclusive. Where value is left to find its natural level,
one class of productive agency will, in the long run, be
equally recompensed with another, presenting an equipoise
of facility or difficulty, of repute or disrepute, of enjoy-
380 million pounds; and the additions made to it between
that period and the year 1829, at the rate of 5,186,800
pounds annually, would make it 103,736,000 pounds.
From the 380,000,000 of coin left in 1809,
we deduct for loss by abrasion, at the
rate of 1 part in 400 in each year,
which in the 20 years would amount
to £18,095,220, thus leaving in
1829,
£361,904,780
To which may be added the
supply from the mines,
103,736,000
Thus showing
£465,640,780.
From which must be deducted that converted
into utensils and ornaments
5,612,611
And that transferred into Asia,
2,000,000
7,612,611 annually.
Or in twenty years,
152,252,220
This would show the estimated amount at
the end of 1829 to be,
£313,388,560.
Or less than at the end of 1809,
£66.611,440.
Or a diminution of nearly one-sixth part in the twenty years.”
“During the period we have been considering, and
indeed for many years before, the comparative value of
gold to silver had scarcely experienced any alteration.
According to the view here taken, the amount of gold ap-
plied to purposes of luxury had far exceeded that of silver,
perhaps in the proportion of four to one; but, on the other
hand, the treasure transferred to India and China has con-
sisted chiefly of silver, and much more gold had been
brought to Europe from those countries than had been con-
veyed to them. It has before (twenty-fifth chapter of this
inquiry) been attempted to be shown that the durability of
gold in coin is in the proportion of four to one greater than
that of silver. It has, too, been shown that the recently in-
creased produce of the mines of Russia has consisted
chiefly of gold. These circumstances, on which our limits
do not admit of enlargement, might be shown to be suffi-
cient to account for the equable rate of value which has
been preserved between the two metals during a long
American Editor.
29. It has been already seen, that the demand for every prod-
uct is great, in proportion to the degree of its utility, and to
the quantity of other products possessed by others, and
capable of being given in exchange. In other words, the
utility of an object, and the wealth of the purchasers, jointly
determine the extent of the demand.
30. In digesting the plan of this work, I hesitated for a long
time, whether or no to place the analysis of value before
that of production; to explain the nature of the quality pro-
duced, before entering upon the investigation of the mode
of its production. But it appeared to me, that to make the
foundation of value intelligible, it was necessary to have a
previous knowledge of wherein the cost of production

ment or suffering, in the general estimation of mankind;
this he states fully in the next chapter. If our author means
here to say merely, that a large class of productive agency
will receive a larger portion of the general product as its
recompense or revenue, or that agency in permanent em-
ploy will obtain a regular and permanent recompense, he
has taken a very circuitous mode of expressing a position,
which is, indeed, almost self-evident. The grand division
of productive agency is into corporeal and intellectual;
whereof the former is, on the average, the more amply
rewarded by the rest of mankind, because the latter, in some
measure, rewards itself. Thus, the profits of printing and
bookselling are, on the whole, more liberal than those of
authorship; because the latter is partly paid in self gratifi-
cation, in vanity or conscious merit. Tr.

41. Nay, even more than annuity interest on the sums spent in
the education of the person who receives the salary; strictly
speaking, it should be annuity interest upon the total sum
devoted to the same class of study, whether it have or have
not been made productive in its kind. Thus the aggregate
of the fees of a physician ought to replace not only what
has been spent in their studies, but, in addition, all the
sums expended in the instruction of the students, who may
have died during their education, or whose success may
not have repaid the care bestowed upon them; for the stock
of medical industry in actual existence could never have
been reared, without the loss of some part of the outlay
devoted to medical instruction. However, there is little use
in too minute attention to accuracy in the estimates of po-
litical economy, which are frequently found at variance
with fact, on account of the influence of moral consider-
ations in the matter of national wealth, an influence that
does not admit of mathematical estimation. The forms of
algebra are therefore inapplicable to this science, and serve
only to introduce unnecessary perplexity. Smith has not
once had recourse to them.
42. I do not mean to include the superior orders of the clergy,
whose benefices the extremely rich and well paid, though

43. From which, however, is to be deducted the average loss
on the general balance of less successful competitors in
the same line. It does not appear, that, in England at least,
any allowance is to be made for personal consideration,
which is seldom attached in a high ratio even to the great-
est excellence in the department of pure art. There is no
instance of a sculptor or a painter arriving at the honours
of the peerage, which have been placed within the reach
of suceessful commercial enterprise. Tr.

45. Smith is greatly embarrassed by his neglect of the dis-
tinction between the profits of superintendency, and those
of capital. He confounds them under the general head of
profits of stock; and all his sagacity and acuteness have
scarcely been sufficient to expound the causes, which in-
fluence their fluctuations. Wealth of Nations, book i. c. 8.
And no wonder he found himself thus perplexed; their
value is regulated upon entirely different principles. The
profits of labour depend upon the degree of skill, activity,
judgment, &amp;c. exerted; those of capital, on the abundance
or scarcity of capital, the security of the investment, &amp;c.
46. Vide supra Book I. chap. 6.
47. By the term labourer, I mean, the person who works on
account of a master-agent, or adventurer, in industry; for
such as are masters of their own labour, like the cobbler in
his stall, or the itinerant knife-grinder, unite the two char-
acters of adventurer and labourer; their profits being in
part governed by the circumstances detailed in the pre-
ceding section, and partly by those developed in this. It is
necessary also to premise, that the labour spoken of in the
present section is that, which requires little or no study or
training; the acquisition of any talent or personal skill en-
titles the possessor to a further profit, regulated upon the
principles explained, supra, sect. 1. of this chapter.
48. A full-grown man is an accumulated capital; the sum spent
in rearing him is indeed consumed, but consumed in a re-
productive way, calculated to yield the product man.
49. The evidence examined before a committee of the House
of Commons of England, in 1815, leads to the conclusion,
that the high price of food, at that period, had the effect of
depressing, rather than elevating the scale of wages. I have
myself remarked the similar effect of the scarcities in
France, of the years 1811 and 1817. The difficulty of pro-
curing subsistence either forced more labourers into the
market, or exacted more exertion from those already en-
gaged; thus occasioning a temporary glut of labour. But
the necessary sufferings of the labouring class at the tine
must inevitably have thinned its ranks.
50. Malthus, Essay on Popul. ed. 5. b. iii. c. 13.
51. The second and last of these circumstances are neither of
them necessarily, universally, or permanently, followed by
the depression of the rate of wages. When a new object of
import does not supersede one of either home or foreign
production, it must tend to raise the rate of wages, as it can
only be procured by enlarged home production. The emi-
gration of consumers, continuing to draw subsistence from
the country they desert, leaves in activity an equal mass of
human labour, though possibly with some variation of
employment. Besides it may be temporary only, as that of
the English to the continent, and of the Irish both to En-
gland and to the continent; who possibly might be brought
back by an improvement of domestic finances or of do-
mestic security and comfort. Tr.

52. Saving-banks have succeeded in several districts of En-
gland, Holland, and Germany; particularly where the gov-
ernment has been wise enough to withhold its interference.
The Insurance Company of Paris has set one on foot, upon
the most liberal principles and with the most substantial
guarantee. It is to be hoped, that the labouring classes in
general will see the wisdom of placing their little savings
in such an establishment, in preference to the hazardous
investments they have often been decoyed into. There is
besides a further national advantage in such a practice,
namely, that of augmenting the general mass of produc-
tive capital, and consequently extending the demand for
human agency. [In the principal cities of the United States,
Saving-banks have also been established, and have been
attended with so much benefit, that they are now spread-
ing through every part of the Union. To the Friendly or
Beneficial Societies there are strong objections, to which
the Saving-banks are not liable. The Friendly Societies
have, undoubtedly, done some good; but attended with a
certain portion of evil. The following extract from a re-
port of the Committee of the Highland Society, places these
latter societies in a very proper light. “During the last cen-
tury, a number of Friendly Societies have been established
by the labourers in different parts of Great Britain, to en-
able them to make provision against want. The principle
of these societies usually is, that the members pay a cer-
tain stated sum periodically, from which an allowance is
made to them upon sickness or old age, and to their fami-
lies upon their death. These societies have done much good;
but they are attended with some disadvantages. In particu-
lar, the frequent meetings of the members occasion the
lose of much time, and frequently of a good deal of money
spent in entertainments. The stated payments must be regu-
larly made; otherwise, after a certain time, the member
(necessarily from its being in fact an insurance) loses the
benefit of all that he has formerly paid. Nothing more than
the stated payments car be made, however easily the mem-
ber might be able at the moment to add a little. to his store.
Frequently the value of the chances on which the societies
are formed, is ill calculated; in which case either the con-
tributors do not receive an equivalent for their payments,
or too large an allowance is given at first, which brings on
the bankruptcy of the institution. Frequently the sums are
embezzled by artful men, who, by imposing on the inex-
perience of the members, get themselves elected into of-
fices of trust. The benefit is distant and contingent; each
member not having benefit from his contributions in ev-
ery case, but only in the case of his falling into the situa-
tions of distress provided for by the society, And the whole
concern is so complicated, that many have hesitation in
embarking in it their hard-earned savings.” American

55. The “multiplication of mankind” is not, as is here asserted
by our author, alone dependent upon “agricultural prod-
ucts;” but, likewise, upon every other description of com-
modities essential to human maintenance and support.
Food, or subsistence, is unquestionably indispensable to
the existence of man; but not more necessary to his pro-
longed being and health, than raiment, shelter, and fire.
The position of Mr. Malthus, which limits population to
subsistence only, and which is here taken for granted and
adopted by our author, is not accurate or just; and by the
more recent political economical inquirers has, therefore,
either been modified or abandoned. Professor Senior, in
his “Two Lectures on Population, delivered before the
University of Oxford in Easter Term, 1828,” in consider-
ing the general principles, adopts the following proposi-
tion, as what appears to him an outline of the laws of popu-
lation= “That the population of= given district is limited.
only by moral or physical evil, or by the apprehension of a
deficiency in the means of obtaining those articles of
wealth; or, in other words, those necessaries, decencies
and luxuries, which the habits of the individuals of each
class of the inhabitants of that district lead them to re-
quire..” American Editor.

59. This is strongly illustrated by the unfunded and the funded
debt of Great Britain. The former, in the shape of exche-
quer and treasury bills, bears a rate of interest consider-
ably lower than the latter in the shape of stock; because
the bills are convertible readily at par; whereas, the usual
rise and fall of the capital stock is much greater, than the
interest upon it for short periods. Tr.
60. The personal restraint of the debtor has nowhere been
carried to such extreme length as in England. Not only
was a debtor at one time liable to imprisonment pendent
lite, and before the debt was legally established, and that
for the smallest sum; but the term of his imprisonment in
execution after judgment, was absolutely unlimited. The
hardship, in both these particulars, was partially remedied
before the erection of our insolvent code; and that code
has still further alleviated the condition of the debtor. But
the whole system is vitiated, and in a great measure,
neutralised, by total neglect of all measures for the pre-
vention of insolvency, in limine. The grand expedient is,
publicity of property; which, in the first place, gives the
creditor the means of estimating beforehand, and with more
accuracy, the grounds and fair extent of his debtor’s credit;
and in the next, enables him, in case of default, to resort to
those means, instead of endeavouring to discover or ex-
tort them by personal restraint. Thus it is, that one error of
policy is sure to engender another. Tr

rate of interest is usually somewhat lower in towns, than
in country places. Wealth of Nations, book i. c. 9. The
reason is plain. Capital is for the most part in the hands of
the wealthy residents of the towns, or at least of persons
who resort to them for their business, and carry with them
the commodity they deal in, i.e., capital, which they do
not like to employ at much distance from their own in-
spection. Towns, and particularly great cities, are the grand
markets for capital, perhaps even more than for labour
itself; accordingly, labour is there comparatively dearer
than capital. In the country, where there is little unemployed
capital, the contrary is observable. Thus, usury is more
prevalent in country places; it would be less so, if the busi-
ness of lending were more safe and in better repute. [These
remarks are just in the main; but the advantage of town
over country, in this particular, may be reduced to a very
trifle, by the ease of internal communication. In England
the difference is scarcely perceptible. Tr.]
65. Vide supra, Book I. chap. 10, 11, on the mode of employ-
ing, and on the transformation and accumulation of capi-
tal. What is here said does not militate against the posi-
tions laid down in Book I, chap. 22. on the representatives
of money. A bill of exchange, with good names upon it, is
only an expedient for borrowing of a third person actual
and positive value, in the interim between the negotiation
and the maturity of the bill. Bills and notes, payable on
demand, or at sight, whether issued by the government, or
by private banking-establishments, are a mere substitu-
tion of a cheap paper agent of circulation, in the place of a
costly and metallic agent. The monetary functions of the
metal being executed by the paper, the former is set free
for other objects; and, inasmuch as it is exchangeable for
other commodities or implements of industry, a positive
accession is made by the substitution to the natural capi-
tal; but no further. The degree of the accession is limited
strictly to the amount of value required fox the business of
circulation, and dispensed with by this expedient; which
amount is a mere trifle, in comparison with the total value
of the national capital.
66. Many loans on interest are made without bearing that
name, and without implying a transfer of money. When a
retail dealer supplies his shop by buying of the manufac-
turer or wholesale dealer, he borrows at interest, and re-
pays, either at a certain term, or before it, retaining the
discount, which is but the return of the interest charged
him in addition to the price of the goods. When a provin-
cial dealer makes a remittance to a banker at Paris, and
afterwards draws upon his banker, he lends to him, during
the time that elapses between the arrival of the remittance
and the payment of the draft. The interest of this advance
is allowed in the interest account which the banker an-
nexes to the merchant’s account current. In the Cours
d’Economie Politique, compiled by Storch, for the instruc-
tion of the young grand-dukes of Russia, and printed at
Petersburgh, tom. vi. p. 103, we are informed, that the En-
glish merchants, or factors, settled in Russia, sell to their
customers at a credit of twelve months, which enables the
Russian purchaser of current articles, to realize long be-
fore the day of payment, and turn the proceeds to account
in the interim; thereby operating with English capital, never
intended to be so employed. It is to be presumed, that the
English indemnify themselves for this loss of interest, by
the additional price of their goods. But the average rate of
profit upon capital in Russia is so high, that even this round-
about way of borrowing is sufficiently profitable to the
native dealers.
67. This is no contradiction to the former position, that the
precious metals form part of the capital of society. They
form an item of capital, but not of disposable, or lendable
capital; for they are already employed, and not in search
of employment; — employed in the business of circulat-
ing value from one hand to another. If their supply exceed
the demand for this object, they are sent to other parts,
where their price continues higher; if their general abun-
dance lower their price everywhere, the sum of their value
is not increased, but a larger quantity of them is given in
exchange for the same value in other commodities.
68. If interest were always low in proportion to the greater
supply of money, it would be lower in Portugal, Brazil,
and the West Indies, than in Germany, Switzerland, &amp;c.,
which is by no means the case.
69. Essays of D. Hume, part ii. ess. 4. Wealth of Nations,
book ii. c. 4. It is well for the student in political economy,
that Locke and Montesquieu have not written more upon
it; for the talent and ingenuity of a writer serve only to
perplex a subject he is not thoroughly acquainted with. To
say the truth, a man of lively wit can not satisfy his own
mind without a degree of speciousness and plausibility,
which is of all things the most dangerous to the generality
of readers, who are not sufficiently grounded in principle
to discover an error at first sight. In those sciences, which
consist in mere compilation and classification, as in botany
or natural history, one can scarcely read too much; but in
those dependent upon the deduction of general laws from
particular facts, the better course is to read little, and se-
lect that little with judgment.
70. This omission is justified by Smith, on the following
grounds. “Let us suppose,” says he, “that in some particu-
lar place, where the common annual profits of a manufac-
turing stock are 10 per cent, there are two different manu-
factures, in one of which the coarse materials annually
207Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
wrought up cost only £700, while the finer materials in the
other cost £7000. If the labour in each cost £300 per an-
num, the capital employed in the one will amount only to
£1000; whereas that employed in the other will amount to
£7300. At the rate of 10 per cent, therefore, the undertaker
of the one will expect a yearly profit of £100 only, and that
of the other £730;” and he goes on to infer, “that the profit
is in proportion to the capital, and not to the labour and
skill of inspection and direction.” But the instance put is
altogether inconclusive; and it is equally easy te suppose
the case of two manufactures, carried on in the same place,
and in the same line, each with an equal capital of £1000
the one under the conduct of all active, frugal, and intelli-
gent manager, the other under that of an idle, ignorant,
and extravagant one; the former yielding a profit of £150
per annum, the latter one of £50 only. The difference in
this case will arise, not from any difference in the respec-
tive capitals employed, but from the difference in the skill
and industry employing them; which latter qualities will
be more productive in the one instance than in the other.
71. Book II. chap. 7. sect. 3.
72. To say nothing of the other motives, that attract industry
towards any particular profession or repel it thence, which
have been noticed in the preceding chapter. These mo-
tives sometimes operate all in the same direction, and then
the profits of both industry and capital rise or fall together;
when they act in opposite directions, the difference on the
profit of capital balances that on the profit of industry; or
vice versa.
73. [The reasoning of this whole section appears to me to be
unsound and inconclusive. There is no distinction in point
of productiveness, between any of the various employ-
ments of capital. There can, in short, be no line drawn
between the different productive channels, into which capi-
tal may be directed. Whatever occupations tend to supply
the wants and increase the comforts and accommodations
of life, are, in the strictest sense of the word, equally pro-
ductive, and nearly in the same proportion augment the
national wealth. The capital employed in the carrying-trade
between one foreign country and another is as advanta-
geous to the individual and nation to which it belongs, as
the capital employed at home. For, as has been already
remarked in relation to the profits of industry in the ab-
sence of all restraints, the profits of all the different em-
ployments of capital, will be on an equality or nearly ap-
proaching it, inasmuch as any material difference will cause
its diversion to a more productive channel, and thus re-
store the equilibrium. In a word, capital flows into the car-
rying-trade only because it yields a greater profit than it
otherwise would do, did it not take that direction.
Moreover, there is no exception to the general prin-
ciple, that what is most productive to the individual is also
so to the community at large. Notwithstanding the con-
trary assertion of our author, in the foregoing section, a
capital lent to, or employed in, a foreign country, if it yield
to the proprietors and nation the highest rate of interest,
must necessarily afford the national revenue as much, and
extend the same assistance to the national industry, as if it
were employed within the pale of the nation. If, for ex-
ample, a capital lent abroad, give employment to foreign
industry and natural agents, it is because its productive
service, when things, I must again repeat, are left to take
their natural course, will yield a larger revenue to its own-
ers. Were not this the case, this capital would not seek
employment abroad, but remain at home. The revenue pro-
duced by capital employed abroad, if the proprietor does
not himself at the same time emigrate there, must be the
means of calling into activity, and giving a greater devel-
opment to the productive faculties of the national industry
and land, as this revenue must be consumed, either pro-
ductively or unproductively at home.] American Editor.
74. In the preceding chapter, I have given the interest, prece-
dence of the profit, of capital, because the former helps to
render the latter more intelligible. I have here adopted a
contrary arrangement, because the consideration of the
profit of land elucidates the subject of rent.
75. Malthus, in his Essay on Population, book i. c. 405, has
given a detail of Rome of the revolting extremes, to which
savage tribes have been reduced by the want of a regular
supply of food.
76. Destutt de Tracy. Commentaire sur l’Esprit de Lois, c.
13. Ricardo, Prin. of Pol. Econ. and Tax. c. 2. [This chap-
ter of Ricardo is perhaps the least satisfactory and intelli-
gible of his whole work. It goes upon the principle de-
tailed by Malthus, in his Essay on Rent; viz., that the ratio
of rent is determined by the difference in the product of
land of different qualities, the worst land in cultivation
yielding no rent at all. But there is a great deal of land
yielding rent without any cultivation; and, in a country
where the whole of the land is appropriated, none is ever
cultivated without paying some rent or other. The downs
of Wiltshire yield a rent, without any labour, or capital,
being expended upon them; so likewise the forests of Nor-
way; this rent is the natural product of the soil; it is paid
for the perception of that natural product, between which,
and the desire for it, an artificial difficulty is interposed by
human appropriation. The whole rent is, therefore, refer-
able, not to the quality of the land only, but to the quality
jointly with the appropriation; and so it is in all cases.
Wherever a difficulty is thus inter. posed, rent will be paid
upon all land brought into cultivation; for why should the
proprietor part with the temporary possession for nothing,
any more than the capitalist with his capital? And the ratio
of rent is determined, not altogether by the quality of the
soil, but by the intensity — 1. Of the desire, or demand for
its productive agency; 2. Of the artificial difficulty inter-
posed by nature and human appropriation. The quality of
the soil may vary the intensity of the demand for it beyond
208Book II= On Distribution
all question; for the quality is the productive agency= but
the supply of agricultural industry and capital in the mar-
ket will also vary the proportion of its product, which in-
dustry and capital will expect for themselves. Why is rent
highest, when a population is condensed on a limited ter-
ritorial surface? because then the utility of its productive
qualities is more strongly felt and desired, in consequence
of their intense difficulty and attainment. And why is rent
still further raised by the prohibition of the import of prod-
ucts of external agriculture? because the natural difficulty
of obtaining the benefit of the productive agency of for-
eign land is aggravated, by the artificial difficulty inter-
posed by legislative enactments. The degree of produc-
tive agency, of course, affects the amount of the product;
but rent originates in the union of that agency, or utility,
with difficulty of attainment, natural and artificial, and is
regulated in its ratio by their combined intensity. Tr.]
77. According to these writers, even the interest of capital is
not given as the recompense of its concurrence in the busi-
ness of production. I have already exposed the fallacy of
this opinion, supra, chap. 8. sect. 2.
78. As well as a demand for the capital and industry requisite
for the cultivation.
79. This catalogue of adverse circumstances, all bearing more
strongly upon the profit of land, than upon that of other
sources of revenue, explains the frequent and unavoidable
remission of rent to the farmer, and proves the accuracy of
M. de Sevigne’s judgment, when she writes from the coun-
try= — “I wish my son could come here and convince him-
self of the fallacy of fancying oneself possessed of wealth,
when one is only possessed of land.” Lettre 224.
80. This is not universally true. In England, where agricul-
ture has attained a high degree of perfection, arable farms
require much larger capitals than formerly; and a farmer is
commonly a much richer man, than the majority of the
tradesmen in his neighbourhood. Tr.
81. The capital, vested in improvements upon land, is some-
times of greater malue than the land itself. This is the case
with dwelling-houses.
82. If, however, this capital be the fruit of his personal frugal-
ity, he robs France of no part of her wealth existing previ-
ous to his arrival. Had he continued resident there, the
aggregate of the capital of France would have been in-
creased to the full extent of his accumulation; but, in tak-
ing the whole away with him, he takes no more than his
own earnings, and no value but what is of his own cre-
ation, in so doing, he commits no individual, and, there-
fore, no national wrong.
83. In the common course of things, such an addition is a
national benefit, because it is an accession to the second-
ary source of production, i.e., industry. But defective hu-
man institutions may convert a benefit into a curse; as
where a poor-law system gives gratuitous subsistence to a
part of the population, capable of labour, but not incited
by want. In such case, every additional human being may
be a burthen instead of a prize; for he may be one more on
the list of idle pensioners. Tr.
84. It will be shown in Book III that the interest is equally
lost, whether spent internally or externally.
85. Raynal tells us, that, inasmuch as the East India Company
derived a revenue from Bengal, to be consumed in Eu-
rope, it must infallibly drain it of specie in the end, since
the company is the only merchant, and imports no specie
itself. But Raynal is mistaken in this. In the first place,
private merchants do carry the precious metals to India,
because they are of more value there than in Europe; and
that very reason also deters the servants of the company,
who may have made fortunes in Asia, from remitting them
in specie. And if it were to be suggested, that a fortune,
remitted to Europe, is less substantial and more speedily
dissipated, when it arrives in the shape of goods, than when
in that of specie, this again would be an error. The form,
that property happens to assume, does not affect its sub-
stantiality; when once transferred to Europe, it may be
converted into specie, or land, or what not. It is the amount
of values, and not the temporary form they appear under,
which, in this colonial connexion, as in that of interna-
tional trade, is the essential circumstance.
[This is a harsh word, yet probably justified by the
history of the original acquisition. But the scene has now
changed; the servants of the sovereign company no longer
look to spoliation as a public or private resource, but are
content with the liberal remuneration of laborious duties,
civil, military, and financial. A slight examination of the
connexion between Britain and her Asiatic dependencies
will show, how small a balance is remitted to the former in
any shape; and it should be remembered that part, even of
this, is but the interest of loans raised in England, for the
purposes of Indian administration, though not always of a
wise or paternal character. Tr.]
86. The complete interception of all export of objects of value
would not help them towards the point of intent; because
free communication occasions a much greater influx than
efflux of wealth. Value, or wealth, is by nature fugitive
and independent. Incapable of all restraint, it is sure to
vanish from the fetters, that are contrived to confine it,
and to expand and flourish under the influence of liberty.
87. Although all products are necessary to the social exist-
ence of man, the necessity of food being of all others most
urgent and unceasing, and of most frequent recurrence,
objects of aliment are justly placed first in the catalogue
of the means of human existence. They are not all, how-
ever, the produce of the national territorial surface; but
are procurable by commerce as well as by internal agri-
culture; and many countries contain a greater number of
inhabitants than could subsist upon the produce of their
land. Nay, the importation of another commodity may be
equivalent to an importation of an article of food. The

doubtless subsist a smaller population, than a country of
equal production, where wealth is more equally diffused.
The very opulent are notoriously averse to the burthen of
a family; and the very indigent are unable to rear one.

[The simple laws of population, or their general prin-
ciples, which are few and plain, are examined, discussed,
and established with great ability by Professor Senior, of
Oxford, as well in the two lectures on Population we have
already referred to, as in his subsequent correspondence
with Mr. Malthus, to which these lectures gave rise, and
which Mr. Senior has subjoined to them, in an appendix.
Full justice is done, by Mr. Senior, to the originality and
depth of Mr. Malthus’s views on Population, as well as to
their great importance, at the time he first gave them to the
public; the inaccuracy, nevertheless, in his statement of
the general proposition, namely, the tendency of every
people to increase in their numbers, more rapidly than in
their wealth, is clearly pointed out, and the errors which
flow from it satisfactorily exhibited. “If a single country,”
says Mr. Senior, “can be found in which there is now less
poverty than is universal in a savage state, it must be true,
that under the circumstances in which that country has been
placed, the means of subsistence have a greater tendency
to increase than the population.” American Editor.]

93. Ustariz has remarked, that the most populous provinces
of Spain are thence, from which there has been the great-
export of wines and brandies to the north of Europe is
almost equivalent to an export of bread; for wine and
brandy, in great measure, supply the place of beer and spir-
its distilled from grain, and thus allow the grain, which
would otherwise be employed in the preparation of beer
or spirits, to be reserved for that of bread.
88. The practice of infanticide in China proves, that the local
prejudices of custom and of religion there counteract the
foresight which tends to check the increase of population;
and one can not but deplore such prejudices; for the hu-
man misery resulting from the destruction is great, in pro-
portion as its object is more fully developed, and more
capable of sensation. For this reason it would be still more
barbarous and irrational policy to multiply wars, and other
means of human destruction, in order to increase the en-
joyments of the survivors; because the destructive scourge
would affect human beings in a state more perfect, more
susceptible of feeling and suffering, and arrived at a pe-
riod of life when the mature display of his faculties ren-
ders man more valuable to himself and to others.
89. The Hospice de Bicetre, near Paris, contains, on the aver-
age, five or six thousand poor. In the scarcity of the year
1795, the governors could not afford them food, either so
good or so abundant as usual; and I am assured by the
house-steward of the establishment, that at that period al-
most all the inmates died. It would appear from the re-
turns given in a tract entitled Observations on the Condi-
tion of the Labouring Classes, by J. Barton, that the aver-
age of deaths, in seven distinct manufacturing districts of
England, has been proportionate to the dearness, or, in
other words, to the scarcity of subsistence. I subjoin an
extract from his statements.

From the same returns it appears, that the scarcity
occasioned less mortality in the agricultural districts. The
reason is manifest= the labourer is there more commonly
paid in kind, and the high sale-price of the product en-
abled the farmer to give a high purchase-price for labour.
[The latter reason is not very satisfactory; for the total re-
ceipts of the corn-growers are probably not larger in years
of scarcity, than in those cf abundance Tr.]

94. Quoted by Malthus, in his Essay on Popul. vol. ii.
95. “Une nuit de Paris reparera tout cela.” It requires the care
and expenditure of twenty successive years to replace the
full-grown man, that a cannonball has destroyed in a mo-
ment. The destruction of the human race by war is far more
extensive than is commonly imagined. The ravage of a
cultivated district, the plunder of dwelling-houses, the
demolition of establishments of industry, the consumption
of capital, &amp;c. &amp;c., deprive numbers of the means of live-
lihood, and cause many more to perish, than are left on the
field of battle.
96. Upon this principle, no capital improvement of the me-
dicinal or chirurgical art, like that of vaccination for in-
stance, can permanently influence national population; yet
its influence upon the lot of humanity may be very consid-
erable; for it may operate powerfully to preserve beings
already far advanced in age, in strength, and in knowl-
edge= whom to replace, would cost fresh births and fresh
advances; in other words, abundance of sacrifices, priva-
tions, and sufferings both to the parents and the children.
When population must be kept up by additional births,
there is always more of the suffering incident to the en-
trance and the exit of human existence; for they are both
of more frequent occurrence. Population may be kept up
with half the number of births and deaths, if the average
term of life be advanced from forty to fifty years. There
will, indeed, be a greater waste of the germs of existence;
but the condition of mankind must be measured by the
quantum of human suffering, whereof mere germs are not
susceptible. The waste of them is so immense, in the ordi-
nary course of nature, that the small addition can be of no
consequence. Were the vegetable creation endowed with
sensation, the best thing that could happen to it would be,
that the seeds of all the vegetables, now rooted up and
destroyed, should be decomposed before the vegetable fac-
ulties were awakened.
97. If population depends on the amount of product, the num-
ber of births is a very imperfect criterion, by which to mea-
sure it. When industry and produce are increasing, births are
multiplied disproportionately to the existing population, so
as to swell the estimate; on the contrary, in the declining
state of national wealth, the actual population exceeds the
average ratio to the births.

100. In a pamphlet entitled, Considerations on British Agricul-
ture, published in 1814, by W. Jacob, a member of the Royal
Society, and a well-informed writer upon agricultural top-
ics, we are told, (p. 34) that England ceased to be an ex-
porter, and became an importer, of wheat, about the year
1800.
101. The writer last cited enters into long details to show, that
the soil of the British isles could be made to produce at least
a third more than their present product, ibid. p. 115. et seq.
102. By judicious colonization, I mean colonization formed on
the principles of complete expatriation, of self-government
without control of the mother-country, and of freedom of
external relations; but with the enjoyment of protection only
by the mother-country, while it should continue necessary.
Why should no. political bodies imitate in this particular the
relation of parent and child. When arrived at the age of ma-
turity, the personal independence of the child is both just
and natural; the relation it engenders is, moreover, the most
lasting and most beneficial to both parties. Great part of Af-
rica might be peopled with European colonies formed on
these principles. The world has yet room enough, and the
cultivated land on the face of the globe is far inferior in ex-
tent to the fertile land remaining untilled. The earl of Selkirk
has thrown much light on this matter, in his tract on Emigra-
tion and the State of the Highlands.
103. The want of capital prevents the employment of machin-
ery for expediting the operations, like the thrashing machine
in common use in England. This makes a larger supply of
human agency requisite in agriculture; and the more mouths
there are to be fed, the smaller will be the surplus produce,
which alone is disposable.
104. There is good reason to believe, that the total population
of England is more than the double of that employed in her
internal agriculture. From the returns laid before parliament,
1811, it appears there were in Great Britain, inclusive of
Wales and Scotland, 895,998 families employed in agricul-
ture; and that the total number of families amounted to
2,544,215, which would give but a third of the population to
the purposes of agriculture.
According to Arthur Young, the country population of
France, within her old limits, was
20,521,538
And that of the cities and towns
5,709,270
Making a total of
26,230,808
Supposing him to be correct, France, within her old bound-
ary, could maintain, on this principle, a population of 41
millions, supposing her merely to double her agricultural
population; and of 60 millions, supposing her industry were
equally active with that of Great Britain.
It is the general remark of travellers, that the traffic
of the great roads of France is much less, than might be
expected, in a country possessing so many natural advan-
tages. This may be attributed chiefly to the small number
and size of her towns; for it is the communication from
town to town that peoples the great road; that of the rural
population being principally from one part of the village
or farm to another.
[Our author has here fallen into a palpaple error.
The ratio of the agricultural, to the total population of Great
Britain, has not been varied as above stated, solely, or even
211Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
chiefly by the multiplication of the commercial and manu-
facturing classes; but by the transfer of the human labour
spared in agriculture to the two other branches of indus-
try. Agriculture might occupy one third only of the popu-
lation of France, and yet the total population be decreased
and not multiplied. Tr.]
105. This position is too general. A pastoral nation, devoting
the whole of its territory to pasture, could spare a very
small proportion of its population for commerce and manu-
facture; witness Tartary and the Pampas of South America.
Where a dense manufacturing and commercial population
makes it advantageous to the land-holder to devote his
land to pasture, and look to foreigners for the supply of
corn, as in Holland, a small proportion of the population
may, indeed be required for domestic, but a large propor-
tion will be required for the anima rion of foreign agricul-
ture. Tr.
106. [The slow progress of agriculture in these provinces of
France is not attributable to the want of towns in the midst
of them; towns and cities are a consequence, not the cause
of the general prosperity of a country. Nor would the adop-
tion of a different policy from that which recommends the
purchase of manufactures from foreign countries with the
raw produce of domestic agriculture, improve the situa-
tion of these districts. A system of policy which should
attempt by restraints or encouragements, to divert a por-
tion of the capital and industry employed in agriculture or
commerce from those channels towards the erection of a
town, or the establishment of a manufactory, with a view
to promote the better cultivation of the soil, would be sub-
versive of this end.
To what causes then must the misery, said by our
author to prevail in those provinces, be ascribed, or what
has retarded their agricultural improvement? The prosper-
ity of agriculture, as well as that of every other branch of
industry, depends upon the unrestrained operation of indi-
vidual interest; not only furnishing motives to exertion,
but knowledge to direct that exertion. All that is necessary
to enable a state to reach the highest pitch of opulence, is
not to disturb the action of this important principle. The
obstacles, it will accordingly be found, which have op-
posed the progress of improvement in the countries al-
luded to, may be traced to the interference by the public
authorities with the salutary operation of this powerful
motive of action, or, in other words, to their bad laws and
political institutions. Sometimes imposing restraints on the
cultivator, and exposing him to numberless oppressions,
either by prescribing the mode in which the soil shall be
cultivated, or the products it shall yield. And, when not
thus directly interfering with the business of production,
prohibiting the exportation of the raw produce of the soil,
and thereby depriving it of the best market. At other times
harassing the husbandman with taxation, the shameful in-
equalities of which, whilst they relieve the higher orders,
permit the burden to fall, almost exclusively, on his shoul-
ders, or depriving him of the freedom of trade from prov-
ince to province within his own country; but, above all, by
perpetuating the inheritance of landed property in particu-
lar bodies or families. without the power of alienation.
These are a few of the corrupt and barbarous laws which
have retarded the agriculture, not of these particular Prov-
inces of France only, but of many of the fairest portions of
Europe.] American Editor.

advantageous as that of some of the other cities of the
Union; it certainly, however, has not been adverse to its
progress in population and wealth. In the year 1800, when
Washington became the seat of the general government,
its whole population amounted to 3,210; according to the
census, it contained in 1810, 8,208 inhabitants, in 1820,
13,247 inhabitants, and in 1830, 18,828 inhabitants. In
the year 1820 the whole number of buildings was 2,208,
of which 925 were of brick. By the assessment valuation
of the year 1830, the whole number of buildings was 3,125.
It cannot, therefore, be said to have been outstripped by
most of the other cities in the progress of improvement.]

108. There is some stretch of imagination in this. Probably
the Egyptian Thebes was itself the centre of manufacture
and commerce in its day, and not its entrepot; indeed, there
is no reason to suppose a very active intercourse between
India and Europe to have existed at so early a period; and,
if it had, Thebes would hardly have been the entrepot. But
central India furnishes itself instances of cities containing
as large a population. Nineveh and Babylon seem to have
been quite as populous; each was probably the central point
of an enormous domestic industry. Tr.</p>
<p>Value may be consumed, either long after its production, or
at the very moment, and in the very act of production, as in
the case of the pleasure afforded by a concert, or theatrical
exhibition. Time and labour may be consumed; for labour,
applicable to an useful purpose, is an object of value, and
when once consumed, can never be consumed again.</p>
