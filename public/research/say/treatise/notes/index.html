                        <p>Notes</p>
<ol>
<li>The following extract of a letter from M. Say, to the Ameri-
can editor, it may not be improper to subjoin, as it con-
tains the author’s opinion of the value he attaches to the
preliminary discourse. “Your translation and restoration
of the preliminary discourse adds, in my eyes, a new value
to your edition. It could only have been from a narrow
calculation of the English publisher, that it was omitted in
Mr. Prinsep’s translation. Ought that portion of the work
to be deemed unuseful, whose aim is to unfold the real
object of the science, to present a rapid sketch of its his-
tory, and to point out the only true method of investigating
it with success? Mr. George Pryme, professor of political
economy in the university of Cambridge, in England, makes
this very discourse the principal topic of several of his
first lectures.”</li>
<li>From oikoj a house, and nomoj a law; economy, the law
which regulates the household. Household, according to
the Greeks, comprehending all the goods in possession of
the family; and political, from polij, civitas, extending its
application to society or the nation at large.
Political economy is the best expression that can be
used to designate the science discussed in the following
treatise, which is not the investigation of natural wealth,
or that which nature supplies us with gratuitously and with-
out limitation, but of social wealth exclusively, which is
The original assignats purported to be payable at sight, at the
Caisse de l’Extraordinaire, where they were, in fact, never
paid at all. It is true, they were received in payment for the
national domains bought by individuals at a competition-price;
but the value of these domains could never give any determi-
nate value to the assignats, because their nominal value in-
creased exactly in proportion as that of the assignats declined.
The government was nut sorry to find the price of national
domains advance, because it was thereby enabled to with-
draw a greater amount of assignats, and consequently, to re-
issue new ones, without enlarging the quantity afloat. It was
not aware, that, instead of the national domains advancing in
price, the assignats were undergoing a rapid depreciation, and
that the further that depreciation was pushed, the more
assignats must be issued in payment of an equal quantity of
supplies.
The last assignats no longer purported to be payable at sight.
The alteration was little attended to, because neither first nor
last were, in fact, ever paid at all. But their vicious origin was
made more apparent. The paper contained these words=
“National domains — Assignat of one hundred francs,” &amp;c.
Now, what was the meaning of the term one hundred francs?
121Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
founded on exchange and the recognition of the right of
property both social regulations.</li>
<li>Experimental science, in order to establish why events take
place in a certain manner, or to be able to assign a particu-
lar cause for a particular effect, to a certain extent must be
descriptive. Astronomy, in order to explain the eclipses of
the sun, must demonstrate the opacity of the moon. Politi-
cal economy, in like manner, in order to ‘show that money
is a means’ of the production of wealth, but not the end,
must exhibit its true nature.</li>
<li>In France, the minister of the interior, in his expose of 1813,
a most disastrous period, when foreign commerce was de-
stroyed, and the national resources of every description
rapidly declining, boasted of having proved by indubitable
calculations, that the country was in a higher state of pros-
perity than it ever before had been.</li>
<li>By the term practice, is not here meant the manual skill
which enables the artificer or clerk to execute with greater
celerity and precision whatever he performs daily, and
which constitutes his peculiar talent; but the method pur-
sued in superintending and administering public or pri-
vate affairs.</li>
<li>Hence it is that nations seldom derive any benefit from the
lessons of experience. To profit by them, the community
at large must be enabled to seize the connexion between
causes and their consequences; which at once supposes a
very high degree of intelligence and a rare capacity, for
reflection. Whenever mankind shall be in a situation to
profit by experience, they will no longer require her les-
sons; plain sound sense will then be sufficient. This is one
reason of our being subject to the necessity of constant
control. All that a people can desire is that laws conducive
to the general interest of society should be enacted and
carried into effect; a problem which different political con-
stitutions more or less imperfectly solve.</li>
<li>“The controversies,” says Col. Torrens, in his ‘Essay on
the Production of Wealth,’ published in 1821, “which at
present exist amongst the most celebrated masters of po-
litical economy, have been brought forward by a lively
and ingenious author as an objection against the study of
the science. A similar objection might have been urged, in
a certain stage of its progress, against every branch of hu-
man knowledge. A few years ago, when the brilliant dis-
coveries in chemistry began to supersede the ancient doc-
trine of phlogiston, controversies, analogous to those which
now exist amongst political economists, divided the pro-
fessors of natural knowledge; and Dr. Priestley, like Mr.
Malthus, appeared as the pertinacious champion of the
theories which the facts established by himself had so
largely contributed to overthrow. In the progress of the
human mind, a period of controversy amongst the cultiva-
tors of any branch of science must necessarily precede the
period of their unanimity. But this, instead of furnishing a
reason for abandoning the pursuits of science, while its
first principles remain in uncertainty, should stimulate us
to prosecute our studies with more ardour and persever-
ance until upon every question within the compass of the
human faculties, doubt is removed and certainty attained.
With respect to political economy, the period of contro-
versy is passing away, and that of unanimity rapidly ap-
proaching. Twenty years hence there will scarcely exist a
doubt respecting any of its fundamental principles”
And in the preface of the third edition of his ‘Essay
on the External Corn Trade,’ published in 1826, Col. Tor-
rens makes these further remarks=  “On a former occasion,
the author ventured to predict, that at no distant period,
controversy amongst the professors of political economy
would cease, and unanimity prevail, respecting the funda-
mental principles of the science. He thinks he can already
perceive the unequivocal signs of the approaching
fulfilment of this prediction. Since it was hazarded, two
works have appeared, each of which, in its own peculiar
line, is eminently calculated to correct the errors which
previously prevailed. These publications are, ‘A Critical
Dissertation on the Nature, Causes, and Measures of Value,
by an anonymous author;’ and ‘Thoughts and Details on
High and Low Prices, by Mr. Tooke.’” — American Edi-
tor.</li>
<li>We may, for example, know that for any given year the
price of wine will infallibly depend upon the quantity to
be sold, compared with the extent of the demand. But if
we are desirous of submitting these two data to mathemati-
cal calculation, their ultimate elements must be decom-
posed before we can become thoroughly acquainted with
them, or can, with any degree of precision, distinguish the
separate influence of each. Hence, it is not only necessary
to determine what will be the product of the succeeding
vintage, while yet exposed to the vicissitudes of the
weather, but the quality it will possess, the quantity re-
maining on hand of the preceding vintage, the amount of
capital that will be at the disposal of the dealers, and re-
quire them, more or less expeditiously, to get back their
advances. We must also ascertain the opinion that may be
entertained as to the possibility of exporting the article,
which will altogether depend upon our impressions as to
the stability of the laws and government, that vary from
day to day, and respecting which no two individuals ex-
actly agree. All these data, and probably many others be-
sides, must be accurately appreciated, solely to determine
the quantity to be put in circulation; itself but one of the
elements of price. To determine the quantity to be de-
manded, the price at which the commodity can be sold
must already be known, as the demand for it will increase
in proportion to its cheapness; we must also know the
former stock on hand, and the tastes and means of the con-
sumers, as various as their persons. Their ability to pur-
chase will vary according to the more or less prosperous
condition of industry in general, and of their own in par-
122Book I=  On Production
ticular; their wants will vary also in the ratio of the addi-
tional means at their command of substituting one liquor
for another, such as beer, cider, &amp;c. I suppress an infinite
number of less important considerations, more or less af-
fecting the solution of the problem; for I question whether
any individual, really accustomed to the application of
mathematical analysis, would even venture to attempt this,
not only on account of the numerous data, but in conse-
quence of the difficulty of characterizing them with any
thing like precision, and of combining their separate in-
fluences. Such persons as have pretended to do it, have
not been able to enunciate these questions into analytical
language, without divesting them of their natural compli-
cation, by means of simplifications, and arbitrary suppres-
sions, of which the consequences, not properly estimated,
always essentially change the condition of the problem,
and pervert all its results; so that no other inference can be
deduced from such calculations than from formula arbi-
trarily assumed. Thus, instead of recognizing in their con-
clusions that harmonious agreement which constitutes the
peculiar character of rigorous geometrical investigation,
by whatever method they may have been obtained, we only
perceive vague and uncertain inferences, whose differences
are often equal to the quantities sought to be determined.
What course is then to be pursued by a judicious inquirer
in the elucidation of a subject so much involved? The same
which would be pursued by him, under circumstances
equally difficult, which decide the greater part of the ac-
tions of his life. He will examine the immediate elements
of the proposed problem, and after having ascertained them
with certainty, (which in political economy can be effected,)
will approximately value their mutual influences with the
intuitive quickness of an enlightened understanding, itself
only an instrument by means of which the mean result of a
crowd of probabilities can be estimated, but never calcu-
lated with exactness.
Cabanis, in describing the revolutions in the science
of medicine, makes a remark perfectly analogous to
this.’The vital phenomena,’ says he, ‘depend upon so many
unknown springs, held together under such various cir-
cumstances, which observation vainly attempts to appre-
ciate, that these problems, from not being stated with all
their conditions, absolutely defy calculation. Hence when-
ever writers on mechanics have endeavoured to subject
the laws of life to their method, they have furnished the
scientific world with a remarkable spectacle, well entitled
to our most serious consideration. The terms they employed
were correct, the process of reasoning strictly logical, and,
nevertheless, all the results were erroneous. Further, al-
though the language and the method of employing it were
the same among all the calculators, each of them obtained
distinct and different results; and it is by the application of
this method of investigation to subjects to which it is alto-
gether inapplicable, that systems the most whimsical, fal-
lacious, and contradictory, have been maintained.’
D’Alembert, in his treatise on Hydrodynamics, ac-
knowledges that the velocity of the blood in its passage
through the vessels entirely resists every kind of calcula-
tion. Senebier made similar observation in his Essai sur
l’Art d’observer, (vol. 1, page 81.)
Whatever has been said by able teachers and judi-
cious philosophers, in relation to our conclusions in natu-
ral science, is much more applicable to moral; and points
out the cause of our always being misled in political
economy, whenever we have subjected its phenomena to
mathematical calculation. In such case it becomes the most
dangerous of all abstractions.</li>

<li>Breve Trattato delle cause che possono far abondare li

<li>“Entro ora a dire della factica, la quale, non solo in tute
le opere que sono intiera mente dell’ arte come le pitture,
sculture, intagli, etc., ma anchi in molti corpi, come sono i
minerali, i sassi, le piante spontanee delle selve, etc., é
l’unica che dà valore alla cosa. La quantità della materia
non per altro coopera in questi corpi al valore se non
parché. aumenta o sema la fatica.” (Galiani, della Mon-
eta. Lib. I, cap. 2.)
“In relation to labour I will remark, that not only in produc-
tions which are entirely the work of art, as in painting,
sculpture, engraving, etc., but likewise in productions of
nature, as on metals, minerals, and plants, their value is
entirely derived from the labour bestowed on their cre-
ation. The quantity of matter affects the value of things
only so far as it requires more or less labour.”
In the same chapter Galiani also remarks, that man,
that is to say his labour, is the only correct measure of
value. This, also, according to Dr. Smith, is a principle; al
though considered by me as an error.</li>
<li>This same Galiani remarks, in the same work, that what-
ever is gained by some must necessarily be lost by others;
in this way proving, that a very ingenious writer may not
even know how to deduce the most simple conclusions,
and may pass by the truth without perceiving it. For, if
wealth can be created by labour, there may then be a new
description of wealth in the world, not taken from any-
body. Indeed, this author in his Dialogues on the Corn
Trade, published in France a long time afterwards, has him-
self, in a very peculiar manner, pronounced his own con-
demnation. “A truth,” he observes, “which is brought to
light by pure accident, like a mushroom in a meadow, is of
no value; we cannot make use of it, if we are ignorant of
123Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
its origin and consequences; or how and by what chain of
reasoning it is derived.”</li>
<li>From my own inability of judging of the merits of such of
these writers whoso works have not been translated, I have;
availed myself of the opinions of one of the translators of
this Treatise into the Spanish language, Don Jose Queypo,
an individual alike distinguished by his abilities and pa-
triotism, whose remarks I have only copied</li>
<li>When they maintain, for example, that a fall in the price
of food is a public calamity.</li>
<li>Among the discussions they provoked, we must not for-
get the entertaining Dialogues on the Corn Trade, by the
abbé Galiani, in which the science of political economy is
treated in the humorous manner of Tristram Shandy. An
important truth is asserted, and when the author is called
upon for its proof, he replies with some ingenious pleas-
antry.</li>
<li>The belief that moral and political science is founded upon
chimerical theories, arises chiefly from our almost con-
tinually confounding questions of right with matters of fact.
Of what consequence, for instance, is the question so long
agitated in the writings of the economists, whether the sov-
ereign power in a country is, or is not, the co-proprietor of
the soil? The fact is, that in every country the government
takes, or in the shape of taxes the people are compelled to
furnish it with, a part of the revenue drawn from real es-
tate. Here then is a fact, and an important one; the conse-
quence of certain facts, which we can trace up, as the cause
of other facts (such as the rise in the price of commodi-
ties) to which we are led with certainty. Questions of right
are always more or less matters of opinion; matters of fact,
on the contrary, are susceptible of proof and demonstra-
tion. The former exercise but little influence over the for-
tunes of mankind; while the latter, inasmuch as facts grow
out of each other, are deeply interesting to them; and, as it
is of importance to us that some results should take place
in preference to others, it is, therefore, essential to ascer-
tain the means by which these may be obtained. The So-
cial Contract of J. J. Rousseau, from being almost entirely
founded upon questions of right, has thereby become, what
I feel no hesitation in avowing, a work of at least but little
practical utility.</li>

<li>See the syllabus of his lectures, which was printed for the
first time in the year 1804, in the valuable collection pub-
lished at Milan by Pietro Custodi, under the title of Scrittori
classici italiani di economia politica. It was unknown to
me until after the publication of the first edition of this
work in 1803.</li>
<li>During the same year that Dr. Smith’s work appeared,
and immediately before its publication, Browne Dignan
published in London, written in the French language, his
Essai sur les principes de l’Economie publique, contain-
ing the following remarkable passage=  “The class of re-
producers includes all who, uniting their labour to that of
the vegetative power of the soil, or modifying the produc-
tions of nature in the processes of their several arts, create
in some sort a new value, of which the sum total forms
what is called the annual reproduction.”
This striking passage, in which reproduction is more
clearly characterised than in any part of Dr. Smith’s writ-
ings, did not lead its author to any important conclusions,
but merely gave birth to a few scattered hints. A want of
connexion in his views, and of precision in his terms, have
rendered his Essay so vague and obscure, that no instruc-
tion whatever can be derived from it.</li>
<li>This difficult and abstruse subject has not, perhaps, been
treated by Dr. Smith with sufficient method and perspicu-
ity. Owing to this circumstance, his intelligent and acute
countryman, lord Lauderdale, has composed an entire trea-
tise, in order to prove that his lordship had completely
failed in comprehending this part of the Wealth of Na-
tions.</li>
<li>In the article Grains, in the Encyclopedie, Quesnay had
remarked, that “commodities which can be sold, ought al-
ways to be considered without distinction, either as pecu-
niary or real wealth, applicable to the purposes of who-
ever may make use of it.” this, in reality, is Dr. Smith’s
exchangeable value. De Verri had observed, (chapter 3 )
that reproduction was nothing more than the reproduction
of value, and that the value of things constituted wealth.
Galiani, as has been already noticed, had sad, that labour
was the source of all value; but Dr. Smith, nevertheless,
made these views his own by exhibiting, as we see, their
connexion with all the other important phenomena, and in
demonstrating them even by their consequences.</li>
<li>Sir James Stewart, author of a Treatise on Political
Economy.</li>
<li>See Chapter third, Book second.</li>
<li>Dr. Smith has, in a satisfactory manner, established the
difference between the real and nominal prices of things,
that is to say, between the quantity of real values which
must be given to obtain a commodity, and the name which
is given to the sum of these values. The difference here
alluded to, arises from a more perfect analysis, in which
the real price itself is decomposed.</li>
<li>It is not, for example, until after the manner in which
production takes place is thoroughly understood, that we
can say how far the circulation of money and commodi-
ties has contributed towards it, and consequently what cir-
culation is used, and what is not; otherwise, we should
only talk nonsense, as is daily done, respecting the utility
of a quick circulation. My being obliged to furnish a chap-
ter on this subject (Book I, Chap. 16.) must be attributed
to the inconsiderable advancement made in the science of
political economy, and to the consequent necessity of di-
recting our attention to some of its more simple applica-
124Book I=  On Production
tions. The same remark is applicable to the twentieth chap-
ter, in the same book, on the subject of temporary and
permanent emigration, considered in reference to national
wealth. Any person, however, well acquainted with the
principles of this science, would find no difficulty in ar-
riving at the same conclusions.
The time is not distant when not only writers on fi-
nance, but on history and geography, will be required to
possess a knowledge of at least the fundamental principles
of political economy. A modern treatise on Universal Ge-
ography, (vol. 2, page 602,) a work in other respects de-
noting extensive research and information, contains the
following passage=  “The number of inhabitants of a coun-
try is the basis of every good sys tem of finance; the more
numerous is its population, the greater height will its com-
merce and manufactures attain; and the extent of its mili-
tary force be in proportion to the amount of its popula-
tion.” Unfortunately, every one of these positions may be
erroneous. National revenue, necessarily consisting either
of the income of the public property, or of the contribu-
tions, in the shape of taxes, drawn from the incomes of
individuals, does not depend upon the number, but upon
the wealth, and above all, upon the incomes of the people.
Now, an indigent multitude has the fewer contributions to
yield, the more mouths it has to feed. It is not the numeri-
cal population of a state, but the capital and genius of its
inhabitants, that most conduce to the advancement of its
commerce; these benefit population much more than they
are benefited by it. Finally, the number of troops a govern-
ment can maintain depends still less upon the extent of its
population than upon its revenues; and it has been already
seen that revenue is not dependent upon population.</li>
<li>Witness Turgot’s Reflections sur la formation et la distri-
bution des richesses, in which he has introduced various
views on both these subjects, either entirely erroneous, or
very imperfect.</li>
<li>Many other points of doctrine, besides those here no-
ticed, have been either overlooked, or but imperfectly ana-
lyzed by Dr. Smith.</li>
<li>Since the time of Dr. Smith, both in England and France,
a variety of publications on political economy have made
their appearance; some of considerable length, but seldom
containing anything worthy of preservation. The greater
part of them are of a controversial character, in which the
principles of the science are merely laid down for the pur-
pose of maintaining a favourite hypothesis; but from which,
nevertheless, many important facts, and even sound prin-
ciples, when they coincide with the views of their authors,
may be collected. The “Essai sur les finances de la Grand-
Bretagne,” by Gentz, and apology for Mr. Pitt’s system of
finance, is of this description; so also is Thornton’s In-
quiry into the nature and effects of paper credit, written
with a view to justify the suspension of cash payments by
the bank of England; as well as a great number of other
works on the same subject, and in relation to the corn laws.</li>
<li>By a popular treatise, I do not mean a treatise for the use
of persons who neither know how to read, nor to make any

to be read by every intelligent and useful member of soci-
ety.</li>

work, Conversations on Political Economy, since trans-
lated into French, in which the soundest principles are
explained ill a familiar and pleasing style.</li>
<li>Every branch of knowledge, even the most important, is
but of very recent origin The celebrated writer on agricul-
ture, Arthur Young, after having bestowed uncommon
pains in the collection of all the observations that had been
made in relation to soils, one of the most important parts
of this science, and which teaches us by what succession
of crops the earth may be, at all times, and with the great-
est success, cultivated, remarked, that he could not find
that anything had been written on this subject prior te the
year 1768. Other arts, not less essential to the happiness
and prosperity of society are still also in their infancy.</li>
<li>In the year 1826, a professorship of political economy
was founded at the university of Oxford, and a highly able
and instructive course of lectures has since been delivered
before that university, by Nassau William Senior, A. M.,
the first professor of political economy. We have rarely
read a more masterly and entertaining performance that
the professor’s discussion of the mercantile theory of
wealth, which occupies three of his lectures. American

<li>I here suppose the higher orders of society to be actuated
by a sincere desire to promote the public good. When this
feeling, however, does not exist, when the government is
faithless and corrupt, it is of still greater importance that
the people should become acquainted with the real state
of things, and comprehend their true interests. Other wise,
they suffer without knowing to what causes their distresses
ought to be attributed, are indeed, by attributing them to
erroneous causes, the views of the public are distracted,
their efforts disunited, and individuals, thus deprived of
general support, fail in resolution, and despotism is
strengthened; or what is still worse, where the people are
so badly governed as to become desperate, they listen to
pernicious counsels, and exchange a vicious order of things
for one still worse.</li>
<li>In how many instances have not great pains been taken,
and considerable capital expended, to increase the evils
125Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
mankind have been desirous of shunning! How many regu-
lations are just so far carried into execution as to produce
all the injury restrictions possibly can effect, and, at the
same time, just as far violated as to retain all the
inconvieniences arising from their infringement!</li>
<li>This arises from our not being able, without serious losses,
to displace the capital and talents, which, owing to an er-
roneous system, have received a faulty direction.</li>
<li>“They would wish, so to express myself, that I might be
able to demonstrate that my proofs are conclusive, and
that they are not wrong in submitting to them. The sound-
ness of my reasoning has produced a momentary convic-
tion; but they afterwards feel the habitual influence of their
former opinions return with undiminished authority, al-
though without any adequate cause, as in the case of the
apparent increase in the diameter of the moon at the hori-
zon. They would wish to be freed by me from these trouble-
some relapses, of whose delusiveness they are sensible,
but which nevertheless importune them. In a word, they
are desirous that I should be enabled to effect by reason
what time alone can accomplish; which is impossible.
Every cause has an effect peculiar to itself. Reason may
convince, opinions carry us along, and illusions perplex
us; but time alone, and the frequent repetition of the same
acts, can produce that state of calmness and ease which
we call habit. Hence it is, that all new opinions are such a
length of time in spreading themselves. If an innovator
has ever had immediate success, it is only from having
discovered and promulgated opinions already floating in
every mind.”
Destutt-Tracy, Logique, chap. 8.</li>
<li>The numerous and difficult points arising out of the con-
fusion of positive and relative value are discussed in dif-
ferent parts of this work; particularly in the leading chap-
ters of Book II. Not to perplex the attention of the reader,
I confine myself here to so much as is absolutely neces-
sary to comprehend the phenomenon of the production of
wealth.</li>
<li>It would be out of place here to examine, whether or no
the value mankind attach to a thing be always proportion-
ate to its actual utility. The accuracy of the estimate must
depend upon the comparative judgment, intelligence, hab-
its, and prejudices of those who make it. True morality,
and the clear perception of their real interests, lead man-
kind to the just appreciation of benefits. Political economy
takes this appreciation as it finds it-as one of the data of its
reasonings; leaving to the moralist and the practical man,
the several duties of enlightening and of guiding their fel-
low-creatures, as well in this, as in other particulars of
human conduct.</li>
<li>This position will hereafter be further illustrated. For the
present it is enough to know, that, whatever be the state of
society, current prices approximate to the real value of
things, in proportion to the liberty of production and mu-
tual dealing.</li>
<li>It will be shown in Book III of this work, what proportion
of the tax is paid by the producer, and what by the con-
sumer.</li>
<li>Since matter can only be modified, compounded, or sepa-
rated, by means either mechanical or chemical, all branches
of manufacturing industry may be subdivided into the me-
chanical and the chemical arts, according to the predomi-
nance of the one or the other in their several processes.</li>
<li>Alagrotti in his Opuscula, by way of exemplifying the
prodigious addition of the value given to an object by in-
dustry, adduces the spiral springs that check the balance-
wheels of watches. A pound weight of pig-iron costs the
operative manufacturer about five cents. This is worked
up into steel, of which is made the little spring that moves
the balance-wheel of a watch. Each of these springs weighs
but the tenth part of a grain; and when completed, may be
sold as high as three dollars, so that out of a pound of iron,
allowing something for the loss of metal, 80,000 of these
springs may be made, and a substance of five cents value
be wrought into a value of 240,000 dollars.</li>
<li>Mercier de la Riviere, in his work entitled Ordre Naturel
des Sociétés Politiques, tom. ii. p. 255, while labouring to
prove, that manufacturing labour is barren and unproduc-
tive, makes use of an argument, which I think it may be of
some service to refute, because it has been often repeated
in different shapes, and some of them specious enough.
He says, “that if the unreal products of industry are con-
sidered as realities, it is a necessary inference, that an use-
less multiplication of workmanship is a multiplication of
wealth.” But because human labour is productive of value,
when it has an useful result, it by no means follows, that it
is productive of value, when its result is either useless or
injurious. All labour is not productive; but such only as
adds a real value to any substance or thing. And the futil-
ity of this argument of the economists is put beyond all
question by the circumstance, that it may be equally em-
ployed against their own system and that of their oppo-
nents. They may be told, “You admit the industry of the
cultivator to be productive; therefore he has only to plough
and sow his fields ten times a year to increase his produc-
tiveness tenfold,” which is absurd.</li>
<li>[Our author, in here asserting, “that more savings are made,
and more capital accumulated from the profits of trade
and manufacture, than from those of agriculture,” has fallen
into an error, which it is proper to notice. In the absence of
prohibitions and restraints, the profits of agriculture, manu-
factures and commerce, will all be on an equality, or al-
ways nearly approaching towards it; for any material dif-
ference will cause a diversion of capital and industry to
the more productive channel, and by that means restore
the equilibrium. In overthrowing the hypothesis of the
economists, the author has inadvertently, fol a moment,
lost sight of his own general principles, which so clearly
126Book I=  On Production
establish the equality of profits in all the different branches
of industry.] American Editor.</li>
<li>Genovesi, who lectured on political economy at Naples,
defines commerce to be “the exchange of superfluities for
necessaries.” He gives as his reason, that in every transac-
tion of exchange, the article received appears to each of
the contracting parties more necessary than that given. This
is a far-fetched notion, which I think myself called on to
notice, because it has obtained considerable currency. It
would be difficult to prove, that a poor labourer, who goes
to the alehouse on a Sunday, exchanges there his superflu-
ity for a necessary. In all fair traffic, there occurs a mutual
exchange of two things, which are worth one the other, at
the time and place of exchange. Commercial production,
that is to say, the value added by commerce to the things
exchanged, is not operated by the act of exchange, but by
the commercial operations that precede it.
The Count de Verri is the only writer within my
knowledge, who has explained the true principle and
ground-work of commerce. In the year 1771, he thus ex-
presses himself=  “Commerce is in fact nothing more than
the transport of goods from one place to another.”
(Meditazioni sulla economia politica, §4) The celebrated
Adam Smith himself appears to have had no very clear
idea of commercial production. He merely discards the
opinion, that there is any production of value in the act of
exchange.</li>
<li>This circumstance has escaped the attention of Sismondi,
or he would not have said, “The trader places himself be-
tween the producer and the consumer, to benefit them both
at once, making his charge for that benefit upon both.”
(Nouveaux Principes d’Economie Pol. Liv. ii. ch. 8). He
would make it appear as if the trader subsisted wholly upon
the value produced by the agriculturist and the manufac-
turer; whereas he is maintained by the real value he him-
self communicates to commodities by giving them an ad-
ditional modification, an useful property. It is this very
notion that stirs up the popular indignation against the
dealers in grain.
L. Say, of Nantes, has fallen into the same mistake
(Principales Causes de la Richesse, &amp;c. p. 110). By way
of demonstrating the value conferred by commerce to be
unreal, he alleges it to be absorbed by the charges of trans-
port. By this incidental process of reasoning, the econo-
mist concluded manufacture to be unproductive; not per-
ceiving, that in these very charges consists the revenue of
the commercial and manufacturing producers; and that it
is in this way that the values raised by production at large
are distributed amongst the several producers.</li>
<li>See his work entitled, “Le Commerce et le Gouvernment
considérés relativement l’un a l’autre.” 1re. partie, ch. 6.</li>
<li>We may consider as agents of the same class of industry,
the cultivator of the land, the breeder of cattle, the wood-
cutter, the fisherman that takes fish he has been at no pains
in breeding, and the miner who, from the bowels of the
earth, extracts metal, stone, or combustibles, that nature
has placed there in a perfect state; and, to avoid multiplic-
ity of denominations, the whole of these occupations may
be called by the name of agricultural industry, because the
superficial cultivation of the earth, is the chief and most
important of all. Terms are. of little consequence, when
the ideas are clear and definite. The wine-grower, who
himself expresses the juice of his grapes, performs a me-
chanical operation, that partakes more of manufacture than
agriculture. But it matters little whether he be classed as a
manufacturer or agriculturist; provided that it be clearly
comprehended in what manner his industry adds to the
value of the product. If we wish to give separate consider-
ation to every possible manner of giving value to things,
industry may be infinitely subdivided. If it be the object to
generalize to the utmost, it may be treated as one and the
same; for every branch of it will resolve itself into this=  the
employment of natural substances and agents in the adap-
tation of products to human consumption.</li>

<li>We shall find in the sequel, that, if any one nation can be
said to be in the service of another, it is that which is the
most dependent; and that the most dependent nations are,
not those which have a scarcity of land, but those which
have a scarcity of capital.</li>

<li>The term entrepreneur is difficult to render in English;
the corresponding word, undertaker, being already appro-
priated to a limited sense. It signifies the master-manufac-
turer in manufacture, the farmer in agriculture, and the
merchant in commerce; and generally in all three branches,
the person who takes upon himself the immediate respon-
sibility, risk, and conduct of a concern of industry, whether
upon his own or a borrowed capital. For want of a better

<li>Besides the direct impulse, given by science to progres-
sive industry, and which indeed is indispensable to its suc-
cess, it affords an indirect assistance, by the gradual re-
moval of prejudice; and by teaching mankind to rely more
upon their own exertions, than on the aid of superhuman
power. Ignorance is the inseparable concomitant of prac-
tical habits, of that slavery of custom which stands in the
way of all improvement; it is ignorance that imputes to a
supernatural cause the ravages of an epidemical disease,
which might perhaps be easily prevented or eradicated,
and makes mankind recur to superstitious observances,
when precaution, or the application of the remedy, is all
that is wanted. Sciences, like facts, are linked together by
a chain of general connexion, and yield one another mu-
tual support and corroboration.</li>

tax would affect all produced value whatever. Upon a con-

by Smith, the net produce of land and of capital ought to
be exempted from taxation altogether, if with him we take
for granted, that they produce nothing spontaneously; but
this would be as unjust on the opposite side.</li>

<li>Thanks to the art of printing, the names of the benefactors
of mankind will henceforward be lastingly recorded; and
if I mistake not, with more veneration than those which
derive lustre from the deplorable exploits of military prow-
ess. Among these will be preserved the names of Olivier
de Serres, the father of French agriculture; the first who
established an experimental firm; of Duhamel, of
Malsherbes, to whom France is indebted for many veg-
etables now naturalized in her soil and climate=  of
Lavoisier, whose new system of chemistry has effected a
still more important revolution in the arts; and of the nu-
merous scientific travellers of modern times; for travels,
with an useful object, may be regarded as adventures in
the field of industry.</li>
<li>Generalization may at pleasure be carried still further; a
landed estate may le considered as a vast machine for the
production of grain, which is refitted and kept in repair by
cultivation=  or a flock of sheep as a machine for the rais-
ing of mutton or wool.</li>
<li>Without having recourse to local or temporary restric-
tions on the use of new methods or machinery, which are
invasions of the property of the inventors or fabricators, a
benevolent administration can make provision for the em-
ployment of supplanted or inactive labour in the construc-
tion of works of public utility at the public expense, as of
canals, roads, churches, or the like; in extended coloniza-
tion; in the transfer of population from one spot to an-
other. Employment is the more readily found for the hands
thrown out of work by machinery because they are com-
monly already inured to labour.</li>
<li>Paradoxical as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that
the labouring class is of all others the most interested in
promoting the economy of human labour; for that is the
class which benefits the most by the general cheapness,
and suffers most from the general dearness of commodi-
ties.</li>
<li>Homer tells us, in the Odyssey, b. xx., that twelve women

<li>Since the publication of the third edition of this work, M.
de Sismondi has published his Nouveaux Principes
d’Economie Politique. This valuable writer seems to have
been impressed with an exaggerated notion of the tran-
sient evils and a faint one of the permanent benefits of
machinery, and to be utterly unacquainted with those prin-
ciples of the science, which place those benefits beyond
controversy. [Our author, in his recent argument with
Malthus, upon the subject of the excess of manufacturing
power and produce, appears to me to have completely vin-
dicated his own positions against the attacks of Sismondi
and Malthus; and to have exposed the fallacy of the ap-
palling doctrine, that the powers of human industry can
ever be too great and too productive. — Vide Letters a M.
Malthus.]</li>
<li>Beccaria, in a public course of lectures on political
economy, delivered at Milan in the year 1769, and before
the publication of Smith’s work, had remarked the
favourable influence of the division of labour upon the
multiplication of products. These are his words=  “Ciascuno
prova coll’ esperienza, che, applicando la mano e l’ingegne
sempre allo stesso genere di opere e di prodotti, egli piu
facilli, piu abondanti e migliori ne travo i resultati, di
quello, che se ciascuno isolatamente le cose tutte a se
necessarie soltanto facesse=  onde altri pascono le pecore,
altri ne cardano le lane, altri le tessonoe=  chi coltiva biade,
chi ne fa il pane=  chi veste, chi fabrica agli agricoltorie la
voranti; crescendo e concatenandosi le arti, e dividendosi
in tal maniera, per la commune e privata utilità gli nomini
in varie classi e condizioni.” “We all know, by personal
experience, that, by the continual application of the cor-
poreal and intellectual faculties to one peculiar kind of
work or product, we can obtain the product with more ease,
and in greater abundance and perfection, than if each were
to depend upon his own exertions for all the objects of his
wants. For this reason, one man feeds sheep, a second cards
the wool, and a third weaves it=  one man cultivates wheat,
another makes bread, another makes clothing or lodging
for the cultivators and mechanics=  this multiplication and
concatenation of the arts, and division of mankind into a
variety of classes and conditions, operating to promote
both public and private welfare.”
However, I have given Smith the credit of original-
ity in his ideas of the division of labour; first, because, in
all probability, he had published his opinions from his chair
of professor of philosophy at Glasgow before Beccaria,
as it is well known he did the principles that form the
ground-work of his book; but chiefly because he has the
merit of having deduced from them the most important
conclusions. [All the fundamental doctrines contained in
the Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations, were comprehended
in Dr. Smith’s course of political lectures, delivered at
Glasgow as early as the year 1752; “at a period surely,”
says Dugald Stewart, “when there existed no French (and
he might have added, nor Italian) performance on the sub-
ject, that could be of much use to him in guiding his re-
searches.” A short manuscript, drawn up by Dr. Smith in
129Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
the year 1755, fully establishes his exclusive claim to the
most important opinions detailed in his treatise on the
Wealth of Nations, which did not appear until the begin-
ning of the year 1776. “A great part of the opinions enu-
merated in this paper, (he observes,) is treated of at length
in some lectures which I have still by me (1755) and which
were written in the hand of a clerk who left my service six
years ago. They have all of them been the constant subject
of my lectures, since I first taught Mr. Craigie’s class, the
first winter I spent in Glasgow, down to this day, without
any considerable variation. — They had all of them been
the subject of lectures which I read in Edinburgh the win-
ter before I left it, and I can adduce innumerable witnesses,
both from that place and from this, who will ascertain them
sufficiently to be mine.” Vide Mr. Stewart’s Account of
the Life and Writings of Adam Smith, LL. D. read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, January 21 and March
18, 1793. American Editor]</li>
<li>But though many important discoveries in the arts have
originated in division of labour, we must not refer to that
source the actual products that have resulted, and will to
eternity result, from those discoveries. The increased prod-
uct must flow from the productive power of natural agents,
no matter what may have been the occasion of our first
becoming acquainted with the means of employing those
agents. Vide supra, Chap. IV.</li>
<li>The combination of operations which at first sight ap-
pears to be distinct, is far more practicable in what our
author calls the branch of application, than in either the
theoretical or the executive branch. A general merchant,
by means of clerks and brokers, will combine a vast vari-
ety of different commercial operations, and yet prosper.
Why. Because his own peculiar task is that of superinten-
dence of commercial dealings; which superintendence may
be extended over a greater surface of dealing without in-
congruity, being on a closer inspection, but a repetition of
the same operation. Tr.</li>
<li>The low price of sugar in China is probably occasioned,
in part, by the circumstance of the grower leaving to a
separate class the extraction of the sugar from the cane.
This operation is performed by itinerant sugar pressers,
who go from house to house, offering their services, and
provided with an extremely simple apparatus Vide
Macartney’s Embassy, vol. iv. p. 198.</li>
<li>The country markets of France not only exhibit extreme
inertness in particular channels of consumption; but a very
cursory observation is sufficient to show, that the sale of
products in them is very limited, and the quality of what
are sold very inferior. Besides the local products of the
district, one sees nothing there, except a few tools,
woollens, linens, and cottons of the most inferior quality.
In a more advanced stage of prosperity, one would find
some few objects of gratification of wants peculiar to a
more refined state of existence=  some articles of furniture
combining convenience and elegance of form; woollens
of some variety of fineness and pattern; articles of food of
a more expensive kind, whether on account of their prepa-
ration or the distance they may have been brought from; a
few works of instruction or tasteful amusement; a few
books besides mere almanacs and prayer-books. In a still
more advanced stage, the consumption of all these things
would be constant and extensive enough to support regu-
lar and well-stocked shops in all these different lines. Of
this degree of wealth examples are to be found in Europe,
particularly in parts of England, Holland, and Germany.</li>
<li>It is not common to meet with such large concerns in
agriculture, as in the branches of commerce and manufac-
ture. A farmer or proprietor seldom undertakes more than
four or five hundred acres; and his concern, in point of
capital and amount of produce, does not exceed that of a
middling tradesman, or manufacturer. This difference is
attributable to many concurrent causes; chiefly to the ex-
tensive area this branch of industry requires; to the bulky
nature of the produce, and consequently difficulty of col-
lecting it at one point from the distant parts of the farm, or
sending it to very remote markets; to the nature of the busi-
ness itself, which is not susceptible of any regular and
uniform system, and requires in the adventurer a succes-
sion of temporary expedients and directions, suggested by
the difference of culture, of manuring and dressings, and
the variety of each labourer’s occupations, according to
the seasons. the change of weather &amp;c.</li>
<li>[This consideration makes it peculiarly incumbent upon
the government of a manufacturing nation to diffuse the
benefits of early education, and thus prevent the degen-
eration from being intellectual as well as corporeal. Tr.]</li>
<li>[“The extensive propagation of light and refinement,”
says Dugald Stewart, “arising from the influence of the
press, aided by the spirit of commerce, seems to be the
remedy to be provided by nature against the fatal effects
which would otherwise be produced, by the subdivision
of labour accompanying the progress of the mechanical
arts=  nor is any thing wanting to make the remedy effec-
tual, but wise institutions to facilitate general instruction,
and to adapt the education of individuals to the stations
they are to occupy. The mind of the artist, which, from the
limited sphere of his activity, would sink below the level
of the peasant or the savage, might receive in infancy the
means of intellectual enjoyment and the seeds of moral
improvement; and even the insipid uniformity of his pro-
fessional engagements, by presenting no object to awaken
his ingenuity or to distract his attention, might leave him
at liberty to employ his faculties on subjects more inter-
esting to himself, and more extensively useful to others.”]

tor.]</li>
<li>The ordinary proportions of this division will be explained,
infra, Book II. Chap. 7.</li>
<li>It has been often asked, Why not combine commercial
with agricultural and manufacturing productions? Why,
for the same reason that makes a wholesale cotton spin-
ner, if he have a surplus of time and capital, more apt to
extend his spinning concern, than to employ his labour
and capital in the working up of his own filiature into
muslin and printed calicoes.</li>
<li>It would be impossible to estimate the proportion with
any tolerable accuracy, even in countries where calcula-
tions of this kind are most in vogue. Indeed, the attempt
would be a sad waste of time. To say the truth, statistical
statements are of little real utility; for, be their accuracy
ever so well assured, hey can only be correct for the mo-
ment. The only knowledge really useful is, the knowledge
of general principles and laws, that is to say, the knowl-
edge of the connexion between cause and effect, which
alone can safely teach us what measures it is best to adopt
in every possible emergency. The sole use of statistics in
political economy is, to supply examples and illustrations
of general principles. They can never be the basis of prin-
ciples, which are grounded upon the nature of things;
whereas statistics, in the most improved state, are only an
index of their quantity.</li>
<li>This position may be correct or not, according to circum-
stances. The national wants must always, in the long run,
be supplied by the national industry and exertions=  but what
is there to prevent a nation from exchanging the larger
portion of its domestic products for the products of other
nations? The people of Tyre probably consumed more
products of external than of domestic industry, although
indeed those external must have been. purchased with
domestic products. Tyre, it is true, was rather a city than a
nation. Holland resembled her in many particulars. The
observation applies to every community, the chief part of
whose production is, the modification of external prod-
ucts. Tr.</li>
<li>[The author has here, in common with Dr. Smith, fallen
into an error. Capital, whether employed in the home or
foreign trade, is equally productive. If, for example, the
home trade realized greater profits than foreign commerce,
every cent of capital employed in the latter would, in a
very little time, be withdrawn from so comparatively dis-
advantageous an investment. Capital will flow into the
foreign, instead of the home trade, only because it will
thereby yield a larger profit. The internal commerce of a
country cannot therefore be said to be “the most advanta-
geous.”] American Editor.</li>
<li>Commerce de reserve. There is no corresponding term in
English; it in intelligible enough.</li>
<li>The carrying trade of Holland is now almost extinct. In
fact, whether or no it be suited to a given nation at a given
time, depends upon a great variety of circumstances. The
advantage of the neutral character gave a very large pro-
portion of it for some years to the American Union, though
notoriously deficient. in capital for the purposes of inter-
nal cultivation.</li>
<li>[The operation of the British Navigation-acts, like all other
restrictive regulations. has been prejudicial to the growth
of national wealth, without, at the same time, having con-
tributed in any degree to the establishment of the naval
preponderance of Great Britain. “If it can be made to ap-
pear,” says a highly distinguished political economist, “that
the greater wealth which we should, in the absence of these
laws, have possessed, would have supplied a revenue ad-
equate to the maintenance of an equal, number of seamen
in the navy, it would follow that we are no gainers by these
acts; and if it further appear that this additional revenue
would have been equal to the maintenance of twice or three
times as many seamen, it would be clear that we are losers
by them. It is acknowledged by many of the advocates for
these laws, that their tendency has not been to increase the
national revenue, but in some degree the reverse.
“Our national preponderance,” says, we believe, Mr.
Horner, “rests on a very different basis. Our national en-
ergy and wealth originate in our freedom, and in that secu-
rity of property which is its happy consequence. The num-
ber of our seamen in merchant shipping is owing to the
spirit and capital of our traders, and to our great extent of
coast. The magnitude of our navy is due neither to naviga-
tion-acts, nor to colonial monopolies, but to the resources
of an industrious country.
“How different are the ideas suggested by such ob-
servations, from the narrow theories of those who trace
our naval superiority to the operation of a few acts of Par-
liament! They remind us of the technical philosophy of
the judge, who gravely ascribed the lamentable prevalence
of duelling, not to the violence of human passions, but to a
misapprehension of the law of the land! Besides, our na-
131Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
val greatness, as it is well remarked by Dr. Smith, was
conspicuous before our navigation laws were framed. It
existed then, as it had done before, and has done since, in
a degree commensurate with our commerce, and with the
extent of our national prosperity. These circumstances, and
not navigation laws, will be found the regulators of naval
power in all countries. They determine its extent among
the Dutch, to whom, even in the season of their greatest
strength, navigation laws were entirely unknown.” Vide
Edinburgh Review, vol. xiv. page 95.] American Editor.</li>
<li>Arthur Young, in his View of the Agriculture of France,
makes no estimate of this item of capital permanently
vested in the land of France within its old limits; but merely
reckons it to be less than the capital so vested in England,
in the proportion of 36 livres tournois per English acre.
So that, in the very moderate supposition, that half as much
capital is vested in permanent amelioration of the land in
France as in England, the capital so vested in Old France,
reckoned at 7 dollars per acre, would amount, upon 131
millions of acres, to 817 millions of dollars for this item
of French capital alone.</li>
<li>The same writer (Young) estimates, that in France. these
two last items of capital, viz., implements, beasts of hus-
bandry, stores of provisions, &amp;c. may be set down at 9
dollars per acre, one acre with another; making an aggre-
gate of 1179 millions of dollars; which, added to the former
estimate, shows a total of 1996 millions of dollars, capital
engaged in the agricultural industry of Old France. He es-
timates the same items of capital in England at twice as
much per acre.</li>
<li>On the subject of saving, Sismondi, and after him our
own Malthus, have adopted a different opinion. Accord-
ing to them, the powers of production have already outrun
the desire and the ability to consume; consequently, every
thing that tends to reduce that desire is injurious, because
it is already too inert fol the interests of production. Where-
fore, inasmuch as the desire of accumulation is the direct
opposite of that of consumption, it must of necessity be
injurious in the highest degree. On these principles, it might
be proved without difficulty, that the prodigality of public
authority, war, or the poor law of England, is a national
benefit=  for all of them stimulate consumption. Indeed they
leave their readers to draw this inevitable conclusion; for
they maintain in plain terms, that the enlargement of the
productive powers of man, by the use of machinery or oth-
erwise, makes the existence of unproductive consumers a
matter, not of mere possibility or probability, but of actual
necessity and expedience. (Vide Sismondi, Nouv. Prin. liv.
ii. c. 3. and liv. iv. c. 4. Malthus, Prin. of Pol. Econ.) These
maxims would justify the prodigality of Louis XIV of
France, and of the Pitt system of England. But fortunately
they are erroneous; and if the contrary principles laid down
by our author here and infra, Chap. XV, needed further
illustration or support, they have been rendered still more
clear and convincing by his recent Lettres à M. Malthus.
— It is true, that the enlargement of productive power natu-
rally leads to the multiplication of unproductive consum-
ers=  why? because the desire of barren consumption, in-
stead of being inert, is always active in the human breast.
But that multiplication is not necessary; for the consumer
may be made a producer, if not of material, at least of
immaterial products, which latter are capable of infinitely
more multiplication and variety, as well as of more gen-
eral diffusion than material products. While this field re-
mains open, a national administration never need despair
of finding occupation for the human labour supplanted by
machinery. And what is the parsimony of modern days? It
is not the hoarding of coin or other valuables, which, though
as our author observes, it subtracts nothing from the na-
tional capital, is yet a social mischief, because it suspends
the utility of an existing product, or at any rate, prevents it
from yielding the human gratification, which its barren
consumption would afford. The accumulations of the mi-
ser are now either vested in reproduction which is benefi-
cial, or in the ownership of the sources of production, land,
&amp;c. &amp;c. which it matters not to public wealth who may be
possessed of, or in the incumbrances of those sources,
mortgages, national funds, &amp;c. &amp;c., which are but por-
tions of that ownership, and to which the same observa-
tion applies. Tr.</li>
<li>The savings of a rich contractor, of a swindler or cheat, of
a royal favourite, saturated with grants, pensions, and un-
merited emoluments, are actual accumulations of capital,
and are sometimes made with facility enough. But the val-
ues thus a-massed by a privileged few, are, in reality, the
product of the labour, capital, and land, of numbers, who
might themselves have made the saving, and turned it to
their own account, but for the spoliation of injustice, fraud,
or violence.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, b. ii. c. 3. Lord Lauderdale, in a work
entitled, Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public
Wealth, has proved, to his own conviction, an opposition
to Smith, that the accumulation of capital is adverse to the
increase of wealth=  grounding his argument on the posi-
tion that such accumulation withdraws from circulation
values which would be serviceable to industry. But this
position is untenable. Neither productive capital, nor the
additions made to it, are withdrawn from circulation=  oth-
erwise they would remain inactive, and yield no profit
whatever. On the contrary, the adventurer in industry, who
makes use of it, employs, disposes of, and wholly con-
sumes it, but in a way that reproduces it, and that with
profit. I have noted this error of his lordship, because it
has been ma de the basis of other works on political
economy, which abound in false conclusions, having set
out on this false principle.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, b. ii. c. 3.</li>
<li>Except during the continuance of ruinous wars, or ex-

cessive public extravagance, such as occurred in France
under the domination of Napoleon. It cannot be doubted,
that, at that disastrous period of her history, even in the
moments of her most brilliant military successes, the
amount of capital dilapidated exceeded the aggregate of
savings. Requisitions and the havoc of war, in addition to
the compulsory expenditure of individuals, and the pres-
sure of exorbitant taxation, must unquestionably have de-
stroyed more values than the exertions of individual
economy could devote to reproductive investment. This
sovereign, wholly ignorant of political economy himself,
and consequently affecting to despise its suggestions, en-
couraged his courtiers, like himself, to squander the enor-
mous revenues derived from his favour, in the apprehen-
sion that wealth might make them independent. [We are
told by Dr. Bowring and Mr. Villiers, in their valuable re-
port on the Commercial Relations between France and
Great Britain, published during the present year (1834),
that the best authorities agree in declaring that the national
riches of France were greatly diminished by the Imperial
Regime, and, probably, a much larger amount was sacri-
ficed in increased prices and diminished trade than was
lost by the more direct operation of Napoleon’s policy.

<li>It is not, however, to be supposed, that the internal
economy of ancient and of modern states is so widely dif-
ferent as some may be led to imagine. There is a striking
similarity between the rise and fall of the opulent cities of
Tyre, Carthage, and Alexandria, and those of the Vene-
tian, Florentine, Genoese, and Dutch republics. The same
cause must ever be attended with the same effect. We read
of the wonderful riches of Croesus, king of Lydia, even
before his conquest of some neighbouring states=  whence
we may infer, that the Lydians were an industrious and
frugal people; for a king can draw his resources solely
from his subjects. The dry study of political economy
would lead to this inference; but it happens to be also con-
firmed by the historical testimony of Justin, who calls the
Lydians a people once powerful in the resources of indus-
try; (gens industria quandam potens;) and gives a notion
of their enterprising character, when he tells us that Cyrus
did not complete their subjugation, until he had habitu-
ated them to indolence, gaming and debauchery. (Jussique
cauponias et ludicras artes et lenocinia exercere.) It is
clear, therefore, that they must have before been possessed
of the opposite qualities. Had Croesus not taken a turn for
pomp and military renown, he would probably have re-
mained a powerful monarch, instead of ending his days in
misfortune. The art of connecting cause with effect, and
the study of political economy, are probably as conducive
to the personal welfare of kings, as to that of their sub-
jects.</li>
<li>This increase of expenditure has not been altogether
nominal, and consequential upon the reduction in the stan-
dard of the silver coinage of France; a greater quantity
and variety of products were consumed, and those of a
better and more expensive quality. And though refined sil-
ver is now intrinsically worth nearly as much as in the
days of Louis XIV, since the same weight of silver is given
for the same quantity of wheat; yet the same ranks of soci-
ety now actually expend more silver in weight as well as
in denomination.</li>

<li>It is to be feared, that taxation will ultimately deprive
the consumer of the advantage of such improvements. The
increase of the internal taxes (droits reunis), of the stamps
on patents, of the taxes and impediments affecting the in-
ternal transport of commodities, have already brought the
price of these vegetable oils almost to a par with the ar-
ticle they had so beneficially supplanted.</li>
<li>It is to be regretted that people should be so little atten-
tive to merit in their testamentary dispositions. There is
always a degree of discredit thrown upon the memory of a
testator, by his bounty to an unworthy object; and, on the
contrary, nothing endears him more to the survivors than a
bequest dictated by public spirit, or the love of private
virtue. The foundation of a hospital, of an establishment
for the education of the poor, of a perpetual premium for
good actions, or a bequest to a writer of eminent merit,
extends the influence of the wealthy beyond the limits of
mortality, and enrols his name in the records of honour.
[This laudable ambition is always proportionate to the
wealth, the civil liberty, and the intelligence of a nation. In
England, scarcely a year passes over our heads without
more than one instance of useful and extensive munifi-
cence. The bequests to the elder Pitt, to Wilberforce, and
other public men, the frequent foundations and enlarge-
ments of institutions of relief or education, reflect equal
honour on the character of the nation, and the memory of

ucts, but this term would be equally applicable to prod-
ucts of a material kind. Intransferable would be equally
incorrect, for this class of products does pass from the
producer to the consumer. The word transient does not
exclude all idea of duration whatever, neither does the word
momentary.</li>
<li>Wherefore de Verri is wrong in asserting, that the occu-
pations of the sovereign, the magistrate, the soldier, and
the priest, do not fall within the cognizance of political
economy. (Meditazioni sulla Economia Politica, §24.)</li>
<li>This error has already been pointed out by M. Germain
Garnier, in the notes to his French translation of Smith.</li>
<li>Some writers, who have probably taken but a cursory
view of the positions here laid down, still persist in setting
down the producers of immaterial products amongst the
unproductive labourers. But it is vain to struggle against
the nature of things. Those at all conversant with the sci-
133Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
ence of political economy, are compelled to yield invol-
untary homage to its principles. Thus Sismondi, after hav-
ing spoken of the values expended in the wages of unpro-
ductive labourers, goes on to say, “Ce sont des Consum-
mations rapides qui suivent immediatement la production,”
Nouv. Princ. tom. ii p. 203; admitting a production by those
he had pronounced to be unproductive!</li>
<li>What, then, are we to think of those who assert in sub-
stance, if not in words, that such a formality or such a tax
is productive of one benefit at least, namely, the mainte-
nance of such or such an establishment of clerks and of-
ficers?</li>

<li>I will not here anticipate the investigation of the profits
of industry and capital, but confine myself to observe, en
passant, that capital is thrown away upon the physician,
and his fees improperly limited, unless, besides the rec-
ompense of his actual labour and talent, (which latter is a
natural agent gratuitously given to him,) they defray the
interest of the capital expended in his education, and not
the common rate of interest, but calculated at the rate of
an annuity.</li>
<li>The wages of the mere labourer are limited to the bare
necessaries of life, without which his agency cannot be
continued and renewed; there is no surplus for the interest
on capital. But the subsistence of his children, until old
enough to earn their livelihood, is comprised in the neces-
saries of the labourer.</li>
<li>An indolent and inert people is always little addicted to
amusements resulting from the exercise of personal facul-
ties. Labour is attended with so much pain to them, as
very few pleasures are intense enough to repay. The Turks
think us mad to find pleasure in the violent motions of the
dance; without re fleeting, that it causes to us infinitely
less fatigue than to themselves. They prefer pleasures pre-
pared by the fatigue of others. There is, perhaps, as much
industry expended on pleasures in Turkey as with us; but
it is exerted in genera. by slaves, who do not participate in
the product.</li>
<li>If it entail a further charge of 300 dollars for annual
repairs and maintenance, the public consumption of plea-
sure or utility may be set down at 10,200 dollars per an-
num. This is the only way of taking the account, with a
view to compare the advantage derived by the payers of
public taxes, with the sacrifices imposed on them for the
acquisition of such conveniences. In the case put above,
the public will be a gainer, if the outlay of 10,200 dollars
have effected an annual saving in the charge of national
production, or, what is the same thing, an annual increase
of the national product, of still larger amount. In the con-
trary supposition, the national administration will have led
the nation into a losing concern.</li>
<li>In many countries, an exaggerated notion seems to pre-
vail, of the damage done by timber-trees, to other prod-
ucts of the soil; yet it should seem, that they rather en-
hance than diminish the revenue of the landholder; for we
find those countries most productive, that are the best
clothed with timber=  witness Normandy, England, Belgium
and Lombardy.</li>
<li>The leaves of trees absorb the carbonic-acid gas float-
ing in the atmosphere we breathe, and which is so injuri-
ous to respiration. When this gas is superabundant, it brings
on asphyxia, and occasions death. On the contrary, veg-
etation increases the proportion of oxygen, which is the
gas most favourable to respiration and to health. Ceteris
paribus, those towns are the healthiest, which have the
most open spaces covered with trees. It would be well to
plant all our spacious quays.</li>

<li>The strength of an individual is so little, when opposed
to that of the government he lives under, that the subject
can have no security against the exactions and abuses of
authority, except in those countries where the guardian-
ship of the laws is entrusted to the all-searching vigilance
of a free press, and their violation checked by an efficient
national representation.</li>
<li>Although, according to our author, it is the province of
speculative philosophy to trace the origin of property, the
existence of which, in all politico-economical inquiries, is
assumed as the foundation of national wealth, it may not
here be improper to introduce a few observations on the
Right of Property, illustrating its historical origin, and
pointing out its true character. Most writers on natural law,
among whom may be named Grotius, Puffendorff,
Barbeyrac, and Locke, ascribe, in general, the origin of
property to priority of occupancy, and have much perplexed
themselves in attempting to prove how this act should give
an exclusive right of individual enjoyment to what was
previously held in common Blackstone, although he does
not enter into the dispute about the manner, as has been
remarked, in which occupancy conveys a right of prop-
erty, expresses no doubt about its having this effect, inde-
pendent of positive institutions.
Later writers on jurisprudence have adopted other
theories on the subject of property, which being altogether
unsatisfactory, we will not notice, except to remark that
the most refined and ingenious speculations, although
equally inconclusive, respecting the nature and origin of
property, are those of Lord Kames, in the Essay on Prop-
erty, in his Historical Law Tracts.
Dugald Stewart, however, is the first inquirer who
has taught us to think and reason with accuracy on this
subject, and it is to his observations on the Right of Prop-
erty, contained in the supplement to the chapter, “Of Jus-
tice,” in his work on the “Philosophy of the Active and
134Book I=  On Production
Moral Powers of Man,” that we must refer the reader who
is desirous of possessing just and unanswerable arguments
for the true foundations on which property rests. We must
here content ourselves with extracting a few passages,
which will exhibit this illustrious philosopher’s views of
the origin of the acquisition of property, which he traces
to two distinct sources.
“It is necessary,” says Stewart, “to distinguish care-
fully the complete right of property, which is founded on
labour, from the transient right of possession which is ac-
quired by mere priority of occupancy; thus, before the ap-
propriation of land, if any individual had occupied a par-
ticular spot, for repose or shade, it would have been unjust
to deprive him of possession of it. This, however, was only
a transient right. The spot of ground would again become
common, the moment the occupier had left it; that is, the
right of possession would remain no longer than the act of
possession. Cicero illustrates this happily by the simili-
tude of a theatre. ‘Quemadmodum theatrum, cum com-
mune sit, recte tamen dici potest ejus esse cum locum quem
quisque occuparit.’ The general conclusions which I de-
duce are these=  — 1. That in every state of society labour,
wherever it is exerted, is understood to found a right of
property. 2. That, according to natural law, labour is the
only original way of acquiring property. 3. That, accord-
ing to natural law, mere occupancy founds only a right of
possession; and that, whenever it founds a complete right
of property, it owes its force to positive institutions.”
After premising these leading propositions, he pro-
ceeds with what he terms a blight historical sketch of the
different systems respecting the origin of property, from
which we have only room to copy the following passage,
which, however, contains this eminent author’s views of
the right of property, as recognised by the law of nature;
and the right of property, as created by the municipal regu-
lations, and demonstrating the futility of the attempts hith-
erto made to resolve all the different phenomena into one
general principle.
“In such a state of things as that with which we are
connected, the right of property must be understood to
derive its origin from two distinct sources; the one is, that
natural sentiment of the mind which establishes a moral
connexion between labour and an exclusive enjoyment of
the fruits of it; the other is the municipal institutions of the
country where we live. These institutions everywhere take
rise partly from ideas of natural justice and partly (per-
haps chiefly) from ideas of supposed utility, — two prin-
ciples which, when properly understood, are, I believe,
always in harmony with each other, and which it ought to
be the great aim of every legislator to reconcile to the ut-
most of his power. Among those questions, however, which
fall under the cognizance of positive laws, there are many
on which natural justice is entirely silent, and which, of
consequence, may be discussed on principles of utility
solely. Such are most of the questions concerning the regu-
lation of the succession to a man’s property after his death;
of some of which it perhaps may be found that the deter-
mination ought to vary with the circumstances of the soci-
ety, and which have certainly, in fact, been frequently de-
termined by the caprice of the legislator; or by some prin-
ciple ultimately resolvable into an accidental association
of ideas. Indeed, various cases may be supposed in which
it is not only useful, but necessary, that a rule should be
fixed; while, at the same time, neither justice nor utility
seem to be much interested in the particular decision.” —

<li>Adam Smith has asserted, that the security afforded to
property by the laws of England has more than counter-
acted the repeated faults and blunders of its government.
It may be doubted, whether he would now adhere to that
opinion.</li>
<li>It would be vain to say to him, why not employ your
works in some other way? Probably, neither the spot nor
the works of a refinery could be otherwise employed with-
out enormous loss.</li>
<li>The industrious faculties are, of all kinds of property,
the least questionable; being derived directly either from
nature, or from personal assiduity. The property in them is
of higher pretensions than that of the land, which may gen-
erally be traced up to an act of spoliation; for it is hardly
possible to show an instance, in which its ownership has
been legitimately transmitted from the first occupancy. It
ranks higher than the right of the capitalist also; for even
taking it for granted, that this latter has been acquired with-
out any spoliation whatever, and by the gradual accumu-
lations of ages, yet the succession to it could not have been
established without the aid of legislation, which aid may
have been granted on conditions. Yet, sacred as the prop-
erty in the faculties of industry is, it is constantly infringed
upon, not only in the flagrant abuse of personal slavery,
but in many other points of more frequent occurrence. A
government is guilty of an invasion upon it, when it ap-
propriates to itself a particular branch of industry, the busi-
ness of exchange and brokerage for example; or when it
sells the exclusive privilege of conducting it. It is still a
greater violation to authorize a gendarme, commissary of
police, or judge, to arrest and detain individuals at discre-
tion, on the plea of public safety or security to the consti-
tuted authorities; thus depriving the individual of the fair
and reasonable certainty of having his time and faculties
at his own disposal, and of being able to complete what he
may begin upon. What robber or despoiler could commit
a more atrocious act of invasion upon the public security,
certain as he is of being speedily put down, and counter-
acted by private as well as public opposition?</li>
<li>This is merely an instance of the necessity of counter-
acting one poison by another. Tr.</li>
<li>Probably, also, were it not for maritime wars, originat-

ing, sometimes in puerile vanity, and sometimes in national
errors of self-interest, commerce would be the best pur-
veyor of timber for ship-building; so that, in reality, the
abuse of the interference of public authority, in respect to
the growth of private timber, is only a consequence of a
previous abuse of a more destructive and less excusable
character.</li>
<li>[If no one knows so well as the proprietor, how to make
the best use of his property, as our author has just remarked,
what advantage can result to society from the interference,
in any case, of public authority, with the rights of indi-
viduals in the business of production. Nothing but the ab-
solute maintenance of the social order should ever be per-
mitted, for an instant, to violate the sacred right of private
property. Quite as specious, though equally unsound rea-
sons may be assigned for imposing restraints upon a vari-
ety of other employments besides mining.] American

<li>Even when money is obtained with a view to hoard or
bury it, the ultimate object is always to employ it in a pur-
chase of some kind. The heir of the lucky finder uses it in
that way, if the miser do not; for money, as money, has no
other use than to buy with.</li>
<li>By bills at sight, or after date, bank-notes, running-cred-
its, write-offs, &amp;c., as at London and Amsterdam.</li>
<li>I speak here of their aggregate consumption, whether
unproductive and designed to satisfy the personal wants
of themselves and their families, or expended in the suste-
nance of reproductive industry. The woollen or cotton
manufacturer operates a two-fold consumption of wool
and cotton=  1. For his personal wear. 2. For the supply of
his manufacture; but, be the purpose of his consumption
what it may, whether personal gratification or reproduc-
tion, he must needs buy what he consumes with what he
produces.</li>
<li>Individual profits must, in every description of produc-
tion, from the general merchant to the common artisan, be
derived from the participation in the values produced. The
ratio of that participation will form the subject of Book II,
infra.</li>
<li>The reader may easily apply these maxims to any time
or country he is acquainted with. We have had a striking
instance in France during the years 1811, 1812, and 1813;
when the high prices of colonial produce of wheat, and
other articles, went hand-in-hand with the low price of
many others that could find no advantageous market.</li>
<li>These considerations have hitherto been almost wholly
overlooked, though forming the basis of correct conclu-
sions in matters of commerce, and of its regulation by the
national authority. The right course where it has, by good
luck been pursued, appears to have been selected by acci-
dent, or, at most, by a confused idea of its propriety, with-
out either self-conviction, or the ability to convince other
people.
Sismondi, who seems not to have very well under-
stood the principles laid down in this and the three first
chapters of Book II of this work, instances the immense
quantity of manufactured products with which England has
of late inundated the markets of other nations, as a proof,
that it is impossible for industry to be too productive. (Nouv.
Prin. liv. iv. c. 4.) But the glut thus occasioned proves
nothing more than the feebleness of production in those
countries that have been thus glutted with English manu-
factures. Did Brazil produce wherewithal to purchase the
English goods exported thither, those goods would not glut
her market. Were England to admit the import of the prod-
ucts of the United States, she would find a better market
for her own in those States. The English government, by
the exorbitance of its taxation upon import and consump-
tion, virtually interdicts to its subjects many kinds of im-
portation, thus obliging the merchant to offer to foreign
countries a higher price for those articles, whose import is
practicable, as sugar, coffee, gold, silver, &amp;c. for the price
of the precious metals to them is enhanced by the low price
of their commodities, which accounts for the ruinous re-
turns of their commerce.
I would not be understood to maintain in this chap-
ter, that one product can not be raised in too great abun-
dance, in relation to all others; but merely that nothing is
more favourable to the demand of one product, than the
supply of another; that the import of English manufactures
into Brazil would cease to be excessive and be rapidly
absorbed, did Brazil produce on her side returns sufficiently
ample; to which end it would be necessary that the legisla-
tive bodies of either country should consent, the one to
free production, the other to free importation. In Brazil
every thing is grasped by monopoly, and property is not
exempt from the invasion of the government. In England,
the heavy duties are a serious obstruction to the foreign
commerce of the nation, inasmuch as they circumscribe
the choice of returns. I happen myself to know of a most
valuable and scientific collection of natural history, which
could not be imported from Brazil into England by reason
of the exorbitant duties. [The views of Sismondi, in this
particular, have been since adopted by our own Malthus,
and those of our author by Ricardo. This difference of opin-
ion has given rise to an interesting discussion between our
author and Malthus, to whom he has recently addressed a
correspondence on this and other parts of the science. Were
any thing wanting to confirm the arguments of this chap-
ter, it would be supplied by a reference to his Lettre 1, à
M. Malthus. Sismondi has vainly attempted to answer
Ricardo, but has made no mention of his original antago-
nist, Vide Annales de Legislation, No. 1. art. 3. Geneve,</li>
<li>Tr.]</li>
<li>The capitalist, in spending the interest of his capital,
spends his portion of the products raised by the employ-
ment of that capital. The general rules that regulate the
136Book I=  On Production
ratio he receives will be investigated in Book II, infra.
Should he ever spend the principal, still he consumes prod-
ucts only; for capital consists of products, devoted indeed
to reproductive, but susceptible of unproductive consump-
tion; to which it is in fact consigned whenever it is wasted
or dilapidated.</li>
<li>A productive establishment on a large scale is sure to
animate the industry of the whole neighbourhood. “In
Mexico,” says Humboldt, “the best cultivated tract, and
that which brings to the recollection of the traveller the
most beautiful part of French scenery, is the level country
extending from Salamanca as far as Silao, Guanaxuato,
and Villa de Leon, and encircling the richest mines of the
known world. Wherever the veins of precious metal have
been discovered and worked, even in the most desert part
of the Cordilleras, and in the most barren and insulated
spots, the working of the mines, instead of interrupting the
business of superficial cultivation, has given it more than
usual activity. The opening of a considerable vein is sure
to be followed by the immediate erection of a town; farm-
ing concerns are established in the vicinity; and the spot
so lately insulated in the midst of wild and desert moun-
tains, is soon brought into contact with the tracts before in
tillage.” Essai pol. sur. la Nouv. Espagne.</li>
<li>It is only by the recent advances of political economy,
that these most important truths have been made manifest,
not to vulgar apprehension alone, but even to the most
distinguished and enlightened observers. We read in
Voltaire that “such is the lot of humanity, that the patriotic
desire for one’s country’s grandeur, is but a wish for the
humiliation of one’s neighbours; — that it is clearly im-
possible for one country to gain, except by the loss of an-
other.” (Dict. Phil. Art. Patrie.) By a continuation of the
same false reasoning, he goes on to declare, that a thor-
ough citizen of the world cannot wish his country to be
greater or less, richer or poorer. It is true, that he would
not desire her to extend the limits of her dominion, be-
cause, in so doing, she might endanger her own well-be-
ing; but he will desire her to progress in wealth, for her
progressive prosperity promotes that of all other nations.</li>
<li>This effect has been sensibly experienced in Brazil of
late years. The large imports of European commodities,
which the freedom of navigation directed to the markets
of Brazil, has been so favourable to its native productions
and commerce, that Brazilian products never found so good
a sale. So there is an instance of a national benefit arising
from importation. By the way, it might have perhaps been
better for Brazil if the prices of her products and the prof-
its of her producers had risen more slowly and gradually;
for exorbitant prices never lead to the establishment of a
permanent commercial intercourse; it is better to gain by
the multiplication of one’s own products than by their in-
creased price.</li>
<li>If the barren consumption of a product be of itself ad-
verse to re-production, and a diminution pro tanto of the
existing demand or vent for produce, how shall we desig-
nate that degree of insanity, which would induce a govern-
ment deliberately to burn and destroy the imports of for-
eign products, and thus to annihilate the sole advantage
accruing from unproductive consumption, that is to say
the gratification of the wants of the consumer?</li>
<li>Consumption of this kind gives no encouragement to
future production, but devours products already in exist-
ence. No additional demand can be created until there be
new products raised there is only an exchange of one prod-
uct for another. Neither can one branch of industry suffer
without affecting the rest.</li>
<li>The term circulation, as well as many others employed
in the science of political economy, is daily made use of at
random, even by persons that pride themselves upon their
precision. “The more equally circulation is diffused,” says
La Harpe, in one of his works, “the less indigence is to be
found in the community.” With great deference to the
learned academician, what possible meaning can the word
circulation have in this passage?</li>
<li>The trade of speculation, as we have before observed,
(supra, Chap. IX) is sometimes of use in withdrawing an
article from circulation, when its price is so low as to dis-
courage the producer, and restoring it to circulation, when
that price is unnaturally raised upon the consumer.</li>
<li>The greatest sticklers for adhering to practical notions,
set out with the assertion of general principles=  they begin,
for instance, with saying, that no one can dispute the posi-
tion, that one individual can gain only what another loses,
and one nation profit only by the sacrifices of another.
What is this but system? and one so unsound, that its abet-
tors, instead of possessing more practical knowledge than
other people, show their utter ignorance of many facts, the
acquaintance with which is indispensable to the formation
of a correct judgment. No man, who understands the real
nature of production, and sees how new wealth may be
and is daily created, would attempt to advance so gross an
absurdity.</li>
<li>At the disastrous period in question, there was no actual
want of wheat; the growers merely felt a disinclination to
sell for paper money. Wheat was sold for real value at a
very reasonable rate; and, though a hundred thousand acres
of pasture land had been converted into arable, the disin-
clination to exchange wheat for a discredited paper-money
would not have been a jot reduced.</li>
<li>Of course, in extraordinary cases, like that of a siege or
a blockade, ordinary rules of conduct must be disregarded.
However irksome the necessity, violent obstructions to the
natural course of human affairs must be removed by coun-
teracting violence; poison is in dangerous cases resorted
to as a medicine; but these remedies require extreme care
and skill in the application.</li>
<li>M. de Humboldt has remarked, that seven square leagues
137Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
of land in a tropical climate, can furnish as much sugar as
the utmost consumption of France, in its best days, has
ever required.</li>
<li>In the sequel of this chapter, it will be shown, that values
exported give precisely the same encouragement to do-
mestic industry, as if they are consumed at home. In the
instance just cited, suppose that wine had been grown in-
stead of the sugar of beet-root, or the blue dye of woad,
the domestic and agricultural industry of the nation would
have been quite as much encouraged. And, since the prod-
uct would have been more congenial to the climate, the
wine produced front the same land would have procured a
larger quantity of colonial sugar and indigo through the
channel of commerce, even if conducted by neutrals or
enemies. The colonial sugar and indigo would have been
equally the product of our own land, though first assum-
ing the shape of wine; only the same space of land would
have produced them in superior quantity and quality. And
the encouragement to domestic industry would be the same,
or rather would be greater; because a product of superior
value would reward more amply the agency of the land,
capital, and industry, engaged in the production.</li>
<li>One is obliged every moment to turn round and combat
objections, that never could have been started, if the sci-
ence of political economy had been more widely diffused.
It will here, for instance, in all probability, be said, — grant-
ing that the sacrifice made in the purchase of the raw flax
for manufacture, and that made in the purchase of cotton,
is to the manufacturer or merchant equal in the one case
and the other, — still, in the one case, the amount of the
sacrifice is expended and consumed in the nation itself,
and conduces to the national advantage; in the other, the
whole advantage goes to the foreign grower. I answer, the
advantage goes to the nation in either case; for the foreign
raw material, cotton, cannot be purchased, except with a
domestic produce which must be bought of the national
grower before the merchant can go to market; whether flax
or any thing else, it must be some value of domestic cre-
ation. Why may he not buy with money. Money itself must
have been originally purchased with some other product,
which must have employed domestic industry, as much as
the growth of flax. Turn it which way you will, it comes to
the same thing in the end. Wealth can only be acquired by
the production of value, or lost by its consumption; and,
putting absolute robbery out of the question. the whole
consumption of a nation must always be supplied from its
internal resources, its land, capital, and industry, even that
portion of it which falls upon external objects.</li>
<li>No one cries out against them, because very few know
who it is that pays the gains of the monopolist. The real
sufferers, the consumers themselves, often feel the pres-
sure, without being aware of the cause of it, and are the
first to abuse the enlightened individuals, who are really
advocating their interests.</li>
<li>What has been said of one trader, may be said equally of
two — three, — in short, of all the traders in the nation.
As far as concerns the balance of commerce, the opera-
tions of the whole will resolve themselves into what I have
just stated. Individual losses may occur on either side, from
the folly or knavery of some few of the traders engaged;
but we may take it for granted, that they will, on the aver-
age, be inconsiderable, in comparison with the total of
business done; at all events, the losses on the one side will
commonly balance those on the other.
It is of very little importance to our purpose to in-
quire, by whom the charge of transport is borne=  usually,
the English trader pays the freight of the goods he buys,
and, imports from. France, and the French trader does the
same upon his purchases from England; both of them look
for the reimbursement of this outlay to the value added to
the articles by the circumstance of transport.</li>
<li>It may be well here to point out a manifest blunder of
some partisans of the exclusive system. They look upon
nothing that a nation receives from abroad as a national
gain, except what is received in the form of specie; which
is in effect, to maintain, that a hatter who sells a hat for 5
dollars gains the whole 5 dollars, because he receives it in
specie. But this cannot be; money, like other things, is it-
self a commodity. A French merchant consigns to England,
brandies to the amount of 20,000 fr.=  his commodity was
equivalent in France to that sum in specie; if it sell in En-
gland for £1000 sterling, and that sum remitted in gold or
silver be worth 24,000 fr. there is a gain of 4000 fr. only,
although France has received 24,000 fr. in specie. And,
should the merchant lay out his £1000 sterling in cotton
goods, and be able to sell them in France for 28,000 fr.
there would then be a gain to the importer and to the na-
tion of 8000 fr., although no specie whatever had been
brought into the country. In short, the gain is precisely the
excess of the value received above the value given for it,
whatever be the form in which the import is made. It is
curious enough, that the more lucrative external commerce
is, the greater must be the excess of the import above the
export; and that the very thing, which the partisans of the
exclusive system deprecate as a calamity, is of all things
to be desired. I will explain why. When there has been an
export of 10, and an import in return of 11 millions, there
is in the nation a value of 1 million more than before the
interchange. And, in spite of the specious statements of
the balance of commerce, this must almost always be so,
otherwise the traders would gain nothing. In fact, the value
of the export is estimated at its value before shipment,
which is increased by the time it reaches its destination=
with this augmented value the return is purchased, which
also receives a like accession of value by the transport.
The value of this import is estimated at the time of entry.
Thus, the result is the presence of a value equal to that
exported, plus the gains outward and homeward. Where-
138Book I=  On Production
fore, in a thriving country, the value of the total imports
should always exceed that of the exports. What then are
we to think of the Report of the French Minister of the
Interior of 1813, who makes the total exports to have been
383 millions of francs, and the total imports, exclusive of
specie, but 350 millions; a statement upon which he felici-
tates a nation, as the most favourable that had ever been
presented. Whereas, this balance shows, on the contrary,
what everybody felt and knew, that the commerce of France
was then making immense losses, in consequence of the
blunders of her administration, and the total ignorance of
the first principles of political economy.
In a tract upon the kingdom of Navarre in Spain,
(Annales des Voyages, tom. I. p. 312,) I find it stated, that,
on the comparison of the value of the exports with that of
the imports of that kingdom, there is found to be an annual
excess of the former above the latter of 120,000 dollars.
Upon which the author very sagely observes, “that if there
be one truth more indisputable than another, it is this, that
a nation which is growing rich cannot be importing more
than it is exporting, for then its capital must diminish per-
ceptibly. And, since Navarre is in a state of gradual im-
provement, as appears from the advance of population and
comfort, it is clear,” — that I know nothing about the mat-
ter, he might have added; — “for I am citing an estab-
lished fact to give the lie to an indisputable principle.” We
are every day witnessing contradictions of the same kind.</li>
<li>564 millions of dollars.</li>
<li>It is a necessary inference from these positions, that a
nation gains in wealth by the partial export of its specie,
because the residue is of equal value to the total previous
amount, and the nation receives an equivalent for the por-
tion exported. How is this to be accounted for? By the
peculiar property of money to exhibit its utility in the ex-
ercise, not of its physical or material qualities, but those
of its value alone. A less quantity of bread will less satisfy
the cravings of hunger; but a less quantity of money may
possess an equal amount of utility; for its value augments
with the diminution of its volume, and its value is the sole
ground of its employment.
Whence it is evident, that governments should shape
their course in the opposite direction to that pursued at
present, and encourage, instead of discouraging, the ex-
port of specie. And so they assuredly will, when they shall
understand their business better=  or rather, they will at-
tempt neither the one nor the other, for it is impossible
that any considerable portion of the national specie can
leave the country, without raising the value of the residue.
And when it is raised, less of it is given in exchange for
commodities, which are then low in price, so as to make it
advantageous again to import specie and export commodi-
ties, by which action and reaction the quantity of the pre-
cious metals is, in spite of all regulations, kept pretty nearly
at the amount required by the wants of the nation.</li>
<li>No one but an entire stranger to these matters would
here be inclined to object, that money can never be
burthensome, and is always disposed of easily enough. So
it may be, indeed, by such as are content to throw its value
away altogether, or at least, to make a disadvantageous
exchange. A confectioner may give away his sugar-plums,
or eat them himself; but in that case he loses he value of
them. It should be observed, that the abundance of specie
is compatible with national misery; for the money, that
goes to buy bread, must have been bought itself with other
products. And, when production has to contend with ad-
verse circumstances, individuals are in great distress for
money, not because that article is scarce, which oftentimes
it is not, but because the creation of the products, where-
with it is procurable, can not be effected with advantage.</li>
<li>A merchant’s leger for two successive years may show
him richer in the, end of the second, than at the end of the
first, although possessed of a smaller amount of specie.

A similar account, differing only in the ratios of the
different items, might be made out for the whole of the
individuals in the community, who would then be evidently
richer, though possessed of much less specie or cash.</li>
<li>The transfer of capital by bills on foreign countries,
comes precisely to the same thing. It is a mere substitute
in the place of the individual making the export of com-
modities, who transfers his right to receive their proceeds,
the value of which remains abroad.</li>
<li>In Book III, which treats of consumption, it will be seen,
that the slower kinds of unproductive consumption are pref-
erable to the more rapid ones. But, in the reproductive
branch, the more rapid are the better; because, the more
quickly the reproduction is effected, the less charge of in-
terest is incurred, and the oftener the same capital can re-
peat its productive agency. The rapidity of consumption,
moreover, does not affect external products in particular;
139Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
its advantages are equal, whether the product be of home
or foreign growth.</li>
<li>The returns of British commerce from the commence-
ment of the 18th century down to the establishment of the
existing paper money of that nation, show a regular an-
nual excess, more or less received by Great Britain in the
shape of specie, amounting altogether to the enormous total
of 347 millions sterling (more than 1600 millions of dol-
lars.) If to this be added the specie already in Great Brit-
ain at the outset, England ought to have possessed a circu-
lating medium of very near 400 millions sterling. How
happens it, then, that the most exaggerated ministerial cal-
culations have never given a larger total of specie than 47
millions, even at the period of its greatest abundance? Vide
Supra, Chap. III.</li>
<li>All of them have acted under the conviction, 1. That the
precious metals are the only desirable kind of wealth,
whereas they perform but a secondary part in its produc-
tion=  2. That they have it in their power to cause their regular
influx by compulsory measures. The example of England
(Vide note preceding,) will show the little success of the
experiment. The pre-eminent wealth of that nation. then,
is derived from some other cause than the favourable bal-
ance of her commerce. But what other cause? Why from
the immensity of her production. But to what does she
owe that immensity. To the frugality exerted in the accu-
mulation of individual capital; to the national turn for in-
dustry and practical application; to the security of person
and property, the facility of internal circulation, and free-
dom of individual agency, which, limited and fettered as it
is, is yet, on the whole, superior to that of the other Euro-
pean states.</li>
<li>In a note, here inserted, in the earlier editions of this
work, the American editor referred to the laudable exer-
tions made by Mr. Huskisson, with the support of Mr.
Canning and other then prominent members of the British
government, to expose the impolicy and injustice of re-
strictions and prohibitions on commerce, and to the suc-
cess of some of their measures to relieve the industry of
the country from the shackles imposed in a less enlight-
ened age. We also then quoted the observations of the
Edinburgh Review, “that Mr. Huskisson, in particular,
against whom every species of ribald abuse had been cast,
had done more to improve the commercial policy of En-
gland during the short period that he was President of the
Board of Trade, than all the ministers who had preceded
him for the last hundred years. And it ought to be remem-
bered to his honour, that the measures he suggested, and
the odium thence arising, were not proposed and incurred
by him in the view of serving any party purpose, but solely
because he believed, and most justly, that these measures
were sound in principle, and calculated to promote the
real and lasting interests of his country.”
Since that time all the successive administrations in
England, both Tory and Whig, have at least uniformly rec-
ognized the soundness of the doctrines of free trade, and
some of them, by various important commercial enact-
ments, have given a still wider application to these benefi-
cial truths; and such, too, has been the effect of their lib-
eral measures, upon the state of opinion and of legislation
throughout Great Britain, that both in and out of parlia-
ment, a most gratifying change has taken place. Commer-
cial questions everywhere now occupy a large share of
attention, are discussed with the greatest ability and acute-
ness in almost all the public journals, and must therefore
lead to the emancipation of commerce from the fetters
which have so long and so perniciously bound it.
In France, however, and other countries which might
be named, the state of knowledge, and the state of opin-
ion, are not yet in favour of liberal commercial views. “For
thirty years,” we are told by the English Commissioners,
Messrs. Villiers and Bowring, “nearly every law passed
on Custom House matters had’ been intended either to
establish or to consolidate the system of protection and
prohibition. Under the encouragement of the legislature,
much capital has been invested in the establishment and
extension of protected manufactures, whose now tottering
and uncertain position (the natural and necessary conse-
quence of the system itself) has made their proprietors most
feelingly alive to any change which might affect them.”

<li>Ricardo, in his Essay on the Principles of Political
Economy and Taxation, published in 1817, has justly re-
marked on this passage, that a government can not, by
prohibition, elevate a product beyond its natural rate of
price=  for in that case, the home producers would betake
themselves in greater numbers to its production, and, by
competition, reduce the profits upon it to the general level.
To make myself better understood, I must therefore ex-
plain, that, by natural rate of price, I mean the lowest rate
at which a commodity is procurable, whether by commerce
or other branch of industry. If commercial can procure it
cheaper than manufacturing industry, and the government
take upon itself to compel its production by the way of
manufacture, it then imposes upon the nation a more
chargeable mode of procurement. Thus, it wrongs the con-
sumer, without giving to the domestic producer a profit,
equivalent to the extra charge upon the consumer; for com-
petition soon brings that profit down to the ordinary level
of profit, and the monopoly is thereby rendered nugatory.
So that, although Ricardo is thus far correct in his criti-
cism, he only shows the measure I am reprobating to be
more mischievous; inasmuch as it augments the natural
difficulties in the way of the satisfaction of human wants,
without any counteracting benefit to any class or any indi-
vidual whatever.</li>
<li>There is a sort of malicious satisfaction in the discovery,
that those who impose these restrictions are usually among
140Book I=  On Production
the severest sufferers. Sometimes they attempt to indem-
nify themselves by a further act of injustice; the public
functionaries augment their own salaries, if they have the
keeping of the public purse. At other times they abolish a
monopoly, when they find it press peculiarly on themselves.
In 1599, the manufacturers of Tours petitioned Henry IV
to prohibit the import of gold and silver silk stuffs, which
had previously been entirely of foreign fabric. They ca-
joled the government by the statement, that they could fur-
nish the whole consumption of France with that article.
The king granted their request, with his characteristic fa-
cility; but the consumers, who were chiefly the courtiers
and people of condition, were loud in their remonstrances
at the consequent advance of price; and the edict was re-
voked in six months. Memoires de Sully, liv. ii.</li>

<li>The national convention of France prohibited the im-
port of raw hides from Spain, on the plea that they injured
the trade in those of France; not observing, that the self-
same hides went back to Spain in a tanned state. The tan-
neries of France being obliged to procure the raw article
at too dear a rate, were quickly abandoned; and the manu-
facture was transferred to Spain, along with great part of
the capital, and many of the hands employed. It is next to
impossible for a government, not only to do any good to
national production by its interference but even to avoid
doing mischief.</li>
<li>It is not my design to insinuate by this, that it is desir-
able that all minds should be imbued with all kinds of
knowledge; but that every one should have just and cor-
rect notions of that, in which he is more immediately con-
cerned. Nor is the general and complete diffusion of in-
formation requisite for the beneficial ends of science. The
good resulting from it is proportionate to the extent of its
progress=  and the welfare of nations differs in degree, ac-
cording to the correctness of their ideas upon those points,
which most intimately concern them respectively.</li>
<li>There is no great weight in this plea of justification. For
experience has shown, that saltpetre is stored against the
moment of need, in the largest quantity, when it is most an
article of habitual import. Yet the legislature of France has
saddled it with duties amounting to prohibition.</li>
<li>The transatlantic colonies, that have within these few
years thrown off their colonial dependence, amongst oth-
ers, the provinces of La Plata, and St. Domingo or Haiti,
have opened their ports to foreigners, without any demand
of reciprocity, and are more rich and prosperous than they
ever were under the operation of the exclusive system. We
are told that the trade and prosperity of Cuba have doubled
since its ports have been opened to the flags of all nations,
by a concurrence of imperious circumstances, and in vio-
lation of the system of the mother country. The elder states
of Europe go on like wrong-headed farmers, in a bigoted
attachment to their old prejudices and methods, while they
have exam pies of the good effects of an improved system
all around them.</li>
<li>Mr. Villiers and Dr. Bowring, in their very valuable re-
port on the commercial relations between France and Great
Britain, presented to both Houses of Parliament, during
the present year, (1834) in remarking upon the disappoint-
ments which had been experienced from treaties of com-
merce between France and Great Britain, point out the true
causes of the failure of these arrangements, however use-
fully they were intended; and as it is of importance in other
countries to guard against a recurrence to similar experi-
ments which might present a formidable barrier against
any permanent or solid change to a more liberal interna-
tional intercourse, we cannot do better, in this place, than
to copy their excellent observations on this head.
“These arrangements, however usefully intended,
were productive of so much inconvenience and suffering
from the sudden shifting of capital, as to induce an unwill-
ingness to await patiently for their ultimate but somewhat
remote advantages. Every treaty of commercial change
must, it is certain, affect some interest or other, and by
these treaties, particularly the treaty of 1786, so many in-
terests were suddenly and severely affected, that they were
enabled, by combining together, to overthrow all the ex-
pectations of future good which would have inevitably
followed the removal of restrictions and prohibitions.”
“It may also be observed, that treaties of commerce
are generally agreements for mutual preferences; and in
so far, are encroachments upon sound commercial prin-
ciples. They are intended to benefit the contracting parties
by common intercourse, to the exclusion (and consequently
to the detriment) of other nations. They ordinarily pro-
pose exclusive advantages, which, if they open some chan-
nels of commercial profit, necessarily close others, and
prevent the negotiating nations from availing themselves
of the improvements or accommodating themselves to the
changes which the fluctuations of agriculture, manufac-
tures, or trade demand. The Methuen treaty, for example,
bound Great Britain to take the produce of a particular
country at diminished duties, whatever superior advantages
any other country might chance to offer; while Portugal
was, at the same time, compelled to receive the manufac-
tures of England, whether or not she might have supplied
herself more profitably elsewhere. A treaty, therefore, with
France, proffering reciprocal advantages, that is to say,
giving to France peculiar privileges in the English market,
or obtaining peculiar privileges for England in the mar-
kets of France, did not appear to offer any prospect of
permanent utility; but, if it were possible that each coun-
try should, for itself, and, with a special view to its own
interests, remove those impediments to intercourse which
had grown out of hostile feelings or erroneous calcula-
tions, and by comparing the facts which each government
141Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
was enabled to furnish for the elucidation of the inquiry,
each should find that it could safely and judiciously pre-
pare for more extended transactions; if, in a word, it could
be shown that each possessed sources of wealth which
might be made productive to the other, while they lost
nothing of their productiveness to the nation that possessed
them, we believed that, in selecting such topics for our
examination, and such objects for their result, we were
best discharging the duty which had devolved on us.”

<li>The political circumstances of England, during the late
war, and her practice of supporting and subsidizing mili-
tary operations on the continent, furnished her with a more
plausible excuse for attempting to export, in the shape of
manufactured produce, those values, which she thus ex-
pended without return. But she had no need to be at any
expense for that purpose. Had England charged a seignor-
age upon the coinage of gold and silver, as she ought to
have done, she needed not to have given herself any trouble
about the form of the values she exported to meet her for-
eign subsidies and expenditure=  guineas would themselves
have been an object of manufacture. [So they were with-
out the imposition of a seignorage, which, however, should
have been charged, But England had no occasion to give
bounties with a view to facilitate her foreign expenditure.
The discount of her bills was a sufficient premium to the
manufacturer; and, where that expenditure was large,
greatly exceeded either drawbacks or bounties. Had specie
been directly procurable, perhaps it might have saved
something to the government, in the reduced profit pay-
able to the merchants upon a mere complex operation. But
the merchants must have made their profit upon bullion.
The sole difference occasioned by the absurdity of gratu-
itous coinage was, the expense incurred in that coinage;
but the imposition of a seignorage would neither have pro-
moted the import of bullion, nor facilitated its transport to
the scene of expenditure. Tr.]</li>
<li>We already have had occasion to remark that there can
be few or no cases in which it would ever be politic to
incur a loss by the payment of bounties, even with the ex-
pectation of insuring the production of objects necessary
to the public safety. For the end aimed at never can be
attained by such means. The naval preponderance of En-
gland, as we before observed, was not owing to any act of
parliament, but can satisfactorily be traced to those causes
we have mentioned in the note referred to. Holland, be-
sides, rose to the nighest point of European maritime power,
without any navigation laws, or bounties to her shipping;
and France, it must be remembered, notwithstanding the
famous Ordonnance in 1664, of Louis XIV, “to engage
builders and mer chants to construct French vessels,” never
obtained the so much desired superiority in ships and in
seamen. American Editor.</li>

<li>I am far from equally approving all the encouragements
of this kind held out by this minister; particularly the sums
lavished on several establishments of pure ostentation,
which, like that of the Gobelin tapestry, have constantly
cost more than they have produced.</li>
<li>Our author, here, has permitted, although with some slight
qualification, an observation to escape from his pen, in
direct contradiction with his own general principles, and
which, therefore, it is necessary to point out and refute
“France,” he remarks, in speaking of her manufactures of
silk and woollen. “probably indebted for them to the wise
encouragement of Colbert’s administration.” What is this
but admitting that beneficial consequences to manufac-
tures necessarily flow from a protecting system. Now, this
we deny, and, in support of this denial, fortunately can at
present invoke the highest authority. In the report on the
commercial relations between France and Great Britain,
which we cannot too often refer to in support of sound
principles, Mr. Villiers and Dr. Bowring, both on this point,
and regarding the merits and character of Colbert’s ad-
ministration, supply us with the following admirable stric-
tures, which we have great satisfaction in presenting to
our readers. They will be found to contain a complete an-
swer to the gratuitous assumption of M. Say, of the wis-
dom herein displayed by Colbert “by this species of en-
couragement” to manufactures.
“France thus became the country which adopted and
still exhibits the consequences of a protecting system on a
large scale. Its introduction maybe traced, or rather its ex-
tension as far as possible, to Colbert, a minister to whose
name and administration a great portion of applause has
been given, but whose system of encouragement was based
on a complete ignorance of the true principles of commer-
cial legislation. How small an amount of manufacturing
prosperity Colbert produced, and how great an amount of
agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing wealth he
either destroyed or checked in its natural progress, will be
obvious to any observer who looks at the immense natural
resources and the active intelligence of France. It may be
safely asserted, that the whole of the bounties by which he
induced adventurers to enter into remote speculations, as
well as the excessive duties which he imposed on cheaper
foreign articles, were almost uncompensated sacrifices;
while, on the other hand, of the manufactures which he
transplanted into France, and which he protected by the
exclusion of rival productions, scarcely one took perma-
nent root; and of those which still exist, and which he in-
tended to support, there is perhaps none which would not
have been more prosperous and extensive, but for those
regulations with which his zeal encumbered the early march
of manufacturing industry. The popularity in France of
Colbert’s commercial legislation, and the erroneous de-
ductions drawn from the consequences of his interference,
have produced a most prejudicial effect on the minds of a
142Book I=  On Production
large portion of the French public. Colbert’s system was a
vain attempt to force capital in new directions. Thus, in
order to compel the establishment of a trade with the West
Indies, he made the French people pay a premium of thirty
francs upon every ton of goods exported, and of fifty francs
for every ton of goods imported, independently of other
encouragements. In the same spirit, he incited manufac-
turing settlers, by large rewards, to establish themselves
in different parts of France, and boasted of his having set
tip more than 40,000 looms, whose produce was protected
by legal enactments; and no one was found to estimate the
counterbalance of loss, while the most flattering pictures
were drawn of enormous gain. He begat in miscalcula-
tion; he brought the most despotic interference to support
his errors; and, if their consequences be faithfully traced,
they will be found little creditable to his own saga. city,
while greatly ruinous to the nation for whose benefit they
were intended. The French Revolution broke down many
of the absurd and pernicious regulations which Colbert
had introduced, but the vestiges of others remain; and al-
though they have become habitual, they interfere with
improvement, and give superiority to countries where the
action of industry and capital is unfettered.”
“Having stated thus much, it would be unjust to with-
hold from Colbert the credit to which he is entitled for the
admirable order he established in the finances, the efforts
which he made to improve, in many particulars, the sys-
tem rf taxation, and his opposition to the inconsiderate
plan of funding adopted by Louvois. The commercial and
maritime legislation of France owes to him the compila-
tion of the ordonnance of 1681, a body of maritime law
unrivalled to this moment.”
As there is, also, another error, in the same paragraph, we
must be allowed briefly to notice it. By advancing to the
manufacturers 2000 francs for every loom at work, our
author thinks Colbert displayed a degree of wisdom hardly
to be expected, inasmuch, as in this instance, “a part of the
advance would be employed in reproduction,” whereas,
according to him, “in ordinary cases, whatever the gov-
ernment levies upon the products of individual exertion is
wholly lost to future production.” Now, nothing can be
more clear, than that the tax levied, for the payment of this
advance, is a pure loss to the tax-paying people, and with
this peculiar aggravation, that a large class of the tax-pay-
ers are not even the consumers of the “encouraged” prod-
uct. Nor is it exactly true, that in “ordinary cases whatever
the government levies is wholly lost to future production,”
for whether the tax be advanced for every loom at work,
or for the work of the looms themselves, is precisely the
same thing; and, as to the destination of the tax, a portion
of it is quite as likely to be employed in reproduction in
the latter as in the former case. Finally, where the tax is
simply an “encouragement” to the products, the amount
of it will be limited by the effective demand for them,
whereas, when the advance is made for every loom at work,
there is no such limit to a useless tax. American Editor.</li>
<li>Under the old regime of the canton of Berne, every pro-
prietor of land was required to furnish, in the proper sea-
son of the year, so many bushels of cockchafers, in pro-
portion to the extent of his property. The rich landholders
were in the habit of buying their contingents from the poor-
est sort of people, who made it their business to collect
them, and did it so effectually, that the district was ulti-
mately cleared of them. But the extreme difficulty, that
even the most provident government meets with in doing
good by its interference in the business of production, may
be judged of by a fact of which I am credibly assured. viz.,
that this act of paternal care gave rise to the singular fraud
of transporting these insects in sacks from the Savoy side
of the Leman lake into the Pays de Vaud.</li>

<li>Colbert’s early education in the counting-house of the
Messrs. Mascrani, of Lyons, a very considerable mercan-
tile establishment, very early imbued him with the prin-
ciples of the manufacturers. Commerce and manufacture
thrived prodigiously under his powerful and judicious pa-
tronage; but, though he liberated them from abundance of
oppression, he was himself hardly sparing enough of ordi-
nances and regulations; he encouraged manufactures at
the expense of agriculture, and saddled the people at large
with the extraordinary profits of monopolists. We cannot
shut our eyes to the fact, that to this system, acted upon
143Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
ever since the days of Colbert, France owed the striking
inequalities of private fortune, the overgrown wealth of
some, and the superlative misery of others; the contrast of
a few splendid establishments of industry, with a wide waste
of poverty and degradation. This is no ideal picture, but
one of sad reality, which one study of principles will help
us to explain.</li>
<li>The loss of this trade has been erroneously imputed to
the liberty of commerce, consequent upon the revolution.
But Felix Beaujour, in his Tableau du Commerce de la
Grèce, has shown that it must be referred to an earlier
period, when restrictions were still in force.</li>

<li>This has been exemplified in the commercial relations
of the United States with China. The American traders
conduct themselves at Canton with more discretion, and
are regarded by the Chinese authorities with less jealousy
than the agents of the English company. The Portuguese,
for upwards of a century, carried on the trade with the
Eastern seas, without the intervention of a company, and
with greater success than any of their contemporaries.</li>

the French East India Company, who asked how it was,
that he had managed his own interests so much better than
those of the company, will long be remembered=  — “Be-

the dictates of my own judgment but. am obliged to fol-
low your instructions in regard to those of the company”</li>
<li>The first French East India Company was established in
the reign of Henry IV, A. D. 1604, at the instance of a
Fleming of the name of Gerard Leroi. It met with no suc-
cess.</li>
<li>The commercial monopoly of the English East India
Company was finally abolished by three acts of Parlia-
ment, passed during the year 1833, namely, chapters 85,
93, and 101 of the 3d and 4th William IV. The first is
entitled, an act for effecting an arrangement with the East
India Company, and for the better government of His
Majesty’s Indian territories, till the 30th day of April, 1851;
the second, an act to regulate the trade of China and India;
and the third, an act to provide for the collection and man-
agement of duties on tea.
By these acts the trade with both China and India is
thrown open, for the first time, to British enterprise and
capital, and British subjects are also permitted to take up
their residence in these countries. It is needless to point
out the vast importance of these enactments, and the great
advantages that must result from them, not only to British
subjects, but to the whole commercial world. The resources
of regions of rich countries that have hitherto lain dor-

<li>It is singular, that, after the very careful revision which
this section has undergone in the last edition, this para-
graph should have been suffered to stand. Indeed, one
would almost suspect that our author had left it rather in
compliment to the popular notions of his own country, than
from personal conviction of the propriety of the measure
he suggests; which is impugned by the whole context of
the remaining part of the section. The best security against
famine is, the total absence of all official interference what-
ever, whether permanent or temporary, as the example of
Great Britain will testify. There the government has at all
times abstained from taking a personal part in the supply
either of town or country, and has limited its interference
to the mere export and import, which have only been
cramped and impeded by ill-advised operations. Another
important ground of security is, the variety of the national
food. Upon this our author has observed. — Vide, infra.

<li>Lamarre, who was a great advocate for the interference
of authority in these matters, and was commissioned by
the government, in the scarcities of the years 1699–1709,
to discover all concealed hoards, and bring to light the
monopolists, frankly confesses, that he was not able to
make seizure of so much as 100 quarters altogether. —

<li>The French minister of the interior, in his report, pre-
sented in December, 1817, admits that the markets were
never so ill supplied as immediately after the decree of
May 4, 1812, prohibiting all sales out of open market. The
consumers crowded thither, having nowhere else to resort
to; while the farmers, being obliged to sell below the cur-
rent price, pretended to have nothing for sale.</li>
<li>In all ages and in all places this effect will follow. The
Emperor Julian, A. D. 362, caused to be sold at Antioch
420,000 modii of wheat imported from Chalsis and Egypt
for the purpose, at a price lower than the average of the
market; the supplies of private commerce were immedi-
ately stopped in consequence, and the famine was aggra-
vated. Vide Gibbon, c. 24. The principles of political
economy are eternal and immutable; but one nation is ac-

to feed more than 50 individuals; whereas the same extent
of surface in Europe, supposing it to yield eight-fold, will
give an annual product of no more than 576 kils. of wheat
flour, which is not enough for the sustenance of two per-
sons. It is natural that Europeans, on their first arrival in a
tropical region, should be surprised at the very limited
extent of cultivated ground, encircling the crowded cab-
ins of the native population.</li>
<li>The same author informs us, that, in St. Domingo, a
superficial square of 3403 toises, is reckoned at an aver-
age capable of producing 10,000 lbs. weigh; of sugar; and
that the total consumption of that commodity in France,
taking it at the fair average of 20,000,000 kils. might be
raised upon a superficial area of seven square leagues.</li>

<li>The question of a free trade in corn is itself of such mag-
nitude and importance, that it would not be practicable to
discuss it within the compass of a note. As our author,
however, has in this paragraph intimated at least doubts of
the superior advantages of entire freedom in the trade in
grain, and even speaks of the “many serious inconveniences
to be apprehended from the ruin of internal tillage,” and
deems it “neither prudent nor safe to become dependent
upon distant supply,” it would not be proper to withhold
from the reader some notice of the labours of the more
recent political economists and practical inquirers, who
have poured a flood of light over this whole inquiry, and
satisfactorily demonstrated the entire inexpediency, as well
as injustice, of restrictions and prohibitions on the impor-
tation of foreign corn.
The first work to which we refer, is the Essay on the
External Corn Trade, by R. Torrens, Esq. M. P. F. R. S.,
fourth edition, London, 1827. It is entitled to distinguished
notice, as a profound and masterly investigation of the prin-
ciples relating to the trade in grain, and explains the man-
ner in which restrictive and prohibitive laws on this sub-
ject have contributed to create revulsions and embarrass-
ments, from which England has experienced so much suf-
fering in her commerce and manufactures. The doctrines
unfolded by Colonel Torrens, in relation to the foreign trade
in corn, have been sanctioned and confirmed by the au-
thority of all the principal writers on political economy,
who have of late directed their attention to the same im-
portant topic. He condemns these laws as unwise, unjust,
and wholly inexpedient.
Next in order we name Mr. James Mill, the author
of the Elements of Political Economy, and the History of
British India. In a pamphlet, which he published in Lon-
don, in 1823, entitled an Essay on the Impolicy of a Bounty
on the Exportation of Grain, and on the Principles which
ought to regulate the Commerce of Grain, he has given a
quainted with them, and another not. The metropolis of
the Roman empire was always destitute of subsistence,
when the government withheld the gratuitous largesses of
grain drawn from a tributary world; and these very lar-
gesses were the real cause of the scarcity felt and com-
plained of.</li>
<li>One of the most frequent causes of famine is, indeed, of
human creation, and that is war, which both interrupts pro-
duction, and wastes existing products. This cause is, there-
fore, within human control; but we can hardly expect it to
be effectually exerted, until governments shall entertain
more accurate notions of their own, as well as of the na-
tional interests; and nations be weaned of the puerility of
attaching sentiments of admiration and glory to perils en-
countered without necessity or reason.</li>
<li>It is mere mockery to talk of the paternal care, solici-
tude, or beneficence of government, which are never of
any avail, either to extend the powers of authority, or to
diminish the suffering of the people. The solicitude of the
government can never be doubted; a sense of intense per-
sonal interest will always guide it to the conservation of
social order, by which it is sure to be the principal gainer.
And its beneficence can have little merit; for it can exert
none but at the expense of its subjects.</li>
<li>Custom, the tyrant of weak minds, and of such, unfortu-
nately, is the great mass of mankind, and of the lower
classes in particular, is always a formidable opponent to
the introduction of a new article of food. I have observed
in some provinces of France, a decided distaste for the
paste prepared in the Italian method, although a most nu-
tritious substance, and well calculated for keeping the flour
sound and good. Probably, nothing but the frequent recur-
rence of scarcity during the political agitations of the na-
tion could have extended the cultivation and consumption
of the potato, so as to have made it a staple article of food
in many districts. The appetite for that vegetable would be
still more general, were a little more attention bestowed
upon preserving and ameliorating the species, and the prac-
tice of raising it from the seed rather than the root more
strictly observed.</li>
<li>Humboldt tells us, in his Essai pol. sur la Nouvelle
Espagne, c. ix. that an equal area of land in that country
will produce bananas, potatoes, and wheat, in the follow-
ing proportions of weight=
Bananas
Potatoes
Wheat
Kilogrammes.
106,000
2,400

The product of bananas is, therefore, in weight, 133
times that of wheat, and 44 times that of potatoes. But a
large deduction must be made for the aqueous particles of
the banana.
A demi-hectare of fertile land in Mexico, by proper
cultivation of the larger species of banana, may be made
145Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
most able examination of these questions. He notices most
of the arguments urged in favour of restrictions and prohi-
bitions in the corn trade, and successfully combats them.
He, moreover, presents many new and luminous views,
and discusses the whole subject with a fairness and candour
that cannot fail to produce conviction in any unprejudiced
mind.
Among the numerous works, to which this impor-
tant subject has given birth in England, none has awak-
ened more attention, or had a more extensive circulation
than the Catechism on the Corn Laws, by T. Perronet Th-
ompson, of Queen’s College, Cambridge. It was first pub-
lished in 1827, and we believe has now passed through
ten editions. The author has given a candid and complete
exhibition of the fallacies that, from time to time, have
been advanced by any writer or journalist of celebrity in
support of the English corn laws, and has annexed to them
respectively the most triumphant and conclusive answers.
No point at issue in the controversy has been left un-
touched, and every objection to the freedom of trade in
grain, we think, removed.
We must not omit to mention the Address to the
Landowners of England on the Corn Laws, by Viscount
Milton, (now Earl Fitzwilliam,) published in London in</li>
<li>This is an appeal by Lord Fitzwilliam to his fellow
proprietors, for he is said to be one of the largest landown-
ers in England, against the course they are pursuing on
this great question, and beseeching them, by every con-
sideration of their country’s peace and welfare, to consent
to the abolition of what he so satisfactorily proves to be a
vicious system. Passing over the anti-commercial charac-
ter of the corn laws and their effects upon the expenses of
government, he confines himself to exposing the perni-
cious consequences which a high price of corn produces
upon the population at large, and upon the operations of
industrious capitalists, abridging the comforts of the
former, frustrating the exertions of the latter, and not even
promoting the welfare of the agriculturists themselves. The
impartial review this author has taken of the controversy,
the careful manner in which he has sifted the arguments
on either side, and the known bias of the order to which he
belongs in favour of the corn laws, must convince every
dispassionate and honest inquirer, that the same process
which changed his opinions must change theirs. Years may
elapse in England, from the undue influence of the landed
aristocracy in legislation, before these restrictive laws can
be repealed; but the force of truth is too great to be re-
sisted very long, and must ultimately prevail.
The last writer we shall refer to is William Jacobs, Esquire, F.
R. S., the author of the Tracts relating to the Corn Trade
and Corn Laws=  including the Second Report ordered to
be printed by the two Houses of Parliament, published in
London, in 1828. Mr. Jacobs has peculiar claims to the
reader’s attention on this subject. He has been for many
years devoted to the examination of the corn trade, is the
Comptroller of Corn Returns, and, from his great knowl-
edge and experience, was selected by the English Board
of Trade to proceed to the continent, and there carefully
examine the actual condition of the agriculture and trade
in corn of the principal grain-growing countries in the North
of Europe. This work contains the results of his observa-
tions and laborious researches, and is entirely a practical
view of the past and present state of the trade in corn,
supported by a variety of curious and entirely authentic
documents. In this place it would be impracticable to give
any detailed account of its great merits as a statistical view
of the subject; and this is not its only excellence. From the
comprehensive and careful survey the author took of the
actual condition of agriculture and trade in corn, in Eu-
rope, he became thoroughly satisfied of the inexpediency
of the corn laws, and declares it to be his deliberate con-
viction that the fair and honest trade of speculation in corn
should be by law restored, as the only means by which the
due price between the producer and consumer can be eq-
uitably adjusted; and he adds, that the destruction of this
trade has been the chief cause of the depression of the
agricultural proprietors both ir England and on the conti-
nent of Europe. American Editor.</li>
<li>It must not be forgotten, that the consumption of the
value of the productive agency, exerted in the course of
production, is quite as real as that of the raw material. And
under this term, productive agency, I comprise that of capi-
tal as well as of human beings.</li>
<li>This is equally true, when the government speculates
with its own private or peculiar funds, as with the produce
of the national lands; for whatever is thus expended might
have gone towards alleviating the public burthens.</li>
<li>The same may be observed of commercial enterprises
undertaken by the public authority. During the scarcity of
1816–17, the French government bought up corn in for-
eign markets; the price of corn rose to an exorbitant rate in
the. home market, and the government resold at a very
high rate, although somewhat below the average of the
market. Individual traders would have found this very prof-
itable venture; but the government was out of pocket 21
millions of francs and upwards. — Rapport au Roi du 24

perity of Great Britain, places at the head of the list, “That
equal and impartial administration of justice, which ren-

fruits of his own industry, gives the greatest and most ef-
fectual encouragement to every sort of industry.” — Wealth

security of person and property.</li>
<li>This security is in fact the main duty of all government.
Were it not for the imperfections of human nature — the
propensity of mankind to vice — society night exist with-
out government, for no man would injure another. It is to
protect one against the vices of another that the forms and
institutions of society are established or supported; thus
arming individual right with the aggregate of social
strength. But the same moral imperfections which drive
mankind into the bonds of society, undermine and vitiate
its institutions. The very engine erected to protect, is di-
rected to the injury and spoliation of individuals, and be-
comes occasionally more dangerous than individual wrong.

<li>The distinction of the two systems is more imaginary
than real. Most of the early establishments of the Europe-
ans in the West were made with the view of absolute mi-
gration. The French at St. Domingo, the English at
Barbadoes, the Spaniards almost universally, settled with-
out the intention of returning home. The introduction of
negro labour was an after-thought. Slavery was an estab-
lished practice in all the ancient world, and colonies either
made prize of the indigenes, or imported slaves from
abroad, as soon as they were rich enough to buy them. Tr.</li>
<li>Vide infra, under the head of Population, Book II. c. 11.</li>
<li>There have been many exceptions in North America and
elsewhere. The colonies of Spain and Portugal in the New
World were of an ambiguous character. Some of the colo-
nists contemplated a return=  others went to establish them-
selves and their posterity; but the whole plan of them has
been subverted, since the commencement of the struggle
for emancipation.</li>

<li>In this calculation no account has been taken of the
housing of the negro, the tools and implements supplied
to him, or the clothing furnished by the master; neither
does our author seem to make any allowance for the prob-
able increase of agricultural production, which free negro
labour might afford. Free European labour would doubt-
less be far more expensive, were it practicable. The inter-
est of money is also estimated far too low, and the infant
and the aged must be provided for by the master. Tr.</li>
<li>It should be observed here, that the free labourers, who
are so much better paid, are commonly engaged in occu-
pations which, though less laborious, require a greater
degree of intelligence and personal skill. Tailors and watch-
makers are generally free men. And the mere existence of
slavery itself enhances the price of free field labour by
driving all competition out of the market.</li>
<li>What reference can this inequality have to the relative
position of the proprietor and the different productive
agents one to another? At is a mere question of difference
of interest of capital. Capital in the West Indies brings a
return very different, in its ratio, to rent or the profit of
land, from what it yields in Europe. Land, the source of
production, sells cheap, because of the greater
unhealthiness of climate, insecurity of tenure, abundance,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Tr.</li>
<li>So it is now from Hindostan, where labour is free and
most abundant. Cotton will flow towards machinery, which
has become too powerful for the competition of human
labour, even where it is the cheapest. That is, therefore,
not the effect of the toleration of slavery in those states.
Tr.</li>
<li>Therefore our author has come to this correct conclu-
sion, his reasoning is neither logical nor satisfactory; in-
deed, the whole or this important subject is dismissed with
a precipitation little suited to its importance. There are
two motives of human industry, the hope of enjoyment,
and the fear of suffering. The slave is actuated principally
by the latter, the free agent by the former. Neither of these
motives should have been thus cursorily adverted to in the
analysis of actual production, but have been fairly set forth
in the outset, immediately after the detail of the sources of
production; being both of them the stimuli which give ac-
tivity to those sources. After all that our author and others
have done, much yet remains for the organization of the
science. Tr.</li>
<li>Or equinoctial; the term is applied to the ordinary prod-
ucts of equinoctial latitudes.</li>
<li>Poivre, a writer of great information and probity, as-
sures us, that white sugar of the best quality is sold in
Cochin-China, at the rate of about 3 dollars per quintal of
the country, which is little more than two cents per pound,
and that more than 80 millions of pounds are thence ex-
ported annually to China at that rate. Adding 300 per cent.
for the charges and profits of trade, which is a most liberal
allowance, the sugar of Cochin-China might, under a free
trade, be sold in France at from 8 to 9 cents a pound.
The English already derive from Asia a consider-
able quantity both of sugar and indigo, at a cheaper rate
than those of the West Indies. And, doubtless, if the Euro-
peans were to plant independent and industrious colonies
along the northern coast of Africa, the culture of equinoc-
tial products there would rapidly gain ground, and supply
Europe in greater abundance at a still cheaper rate.</li>
<li>Arthur Young, in 1789, estimated the annual charge en-
tailed on France, by the possession of St. Domingo, at 9
millions of dollars. He has gone into detail to prove, that,
if the sums spent on her colonies for 25 years only had
been devoted to the improvement of any one of her own
provinces, she would have acquired an annual addition of
24 millions of dollars, net revenue, consisting of actual
products, without loss to any body. Vide his Journey in
France.
147Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy</li>
<li>Œuvres de Poivre, p. 209. In this estimate he takes no
account of the charge of the military and marine establish-
ment of France herself of which a part should be set down
to the colony.</li>
<li>Vide the works of Benjamin Franklin, vol. ii. p. 50, for
the. opinion of that celebrated man, who had so much ex-
perience in these matters I find it stated in the Travels of
Lord Valentia that the Cape of Good Hope, in 1802, cost
England an excess of from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 dollars
per annum above its own revenue.</li>
<li>“Bristol was one of the chief entrepots of North Ameri-
can commerce. Her principal merchants and inhabitants
joined in a most energetic representation to parliament,
that their city would be infallibly ruined by the acknowl-
edgment of American independence; adding, that their port
would be so deserted, as not to be worth the charge of
keeping up. Notwithstanding their representations, peace
became a matter of necessity, and the dreaded separation
was consented to. Ten years had scarcely elapsed after this
event, when the same worthy persons petitioned the par-
liament for leave to enlarge and deepen the port, which,
instead of being deserted, as they had apprehended, was
incapable of receiving the influx of additional shipping,
that the commerce of independent America had given birth
to.” De Levis, Lettres Chinoises.</li>
<li>These remarks are not altogether applicable to the Brit-
ish dependencies in the East; because there the nation is
rather a conqueror than a colonist, having the domination
over thirty-two millions of inhabitants, and the absolute
disposal of the revenue levied upon them. But the clear
national profits derived from the acquisition is by no means
so considerable, as may be generally supposed; for the
charges of administration and protection must be deducted.
Colquhoun, in his Treatise on the Wealth, Power, and Re-
sources of the British Empire, which gives an exaggerated
picture of them, states the total revenue of the sovereign
company, at £18,051,478 sterling; and its expenditure at
£16,984,271; leaving a surplus of £1,0167,207.
In all probability were India in a state of national
independence, the commerce between her and Great Brit-
ain would increase so much, as to produce to the latter an
additional revenue, larger than the amount of that surplus,
to say nothing of the increase of individual profits.</li>
<li>The population of France, notwithstanding the interrup-
tion to industry, and the drains occasioned by the long wars,
has increased since the commencement of the Revolution.
According to calculations made by the National Assem-
bly in 1791, France contained 26,363,074 inhabitants, and
in 1831 it contained 32,560,000 within the same limits.
The annual increase is about 200,000 individuals. (Vide
Annuaire pour l’An 1834.) American Editor.</li>
<li>The vast continent of New Holland, with its surround-
ing islands, is now generally considered by geographers
as a distinct portion of the globe, under the denomination
of Australia or. Australasia, which has been given to it on
account of its position exclusively within the southern
hemisphere.</li>
<li>A strange country has some advantages over the travel-
ler, and its dealings with him may be considered as lucra-
tive; for his ignorance of the language and of prices, and
often a spice of vanity, make him pay for most of the ob-
jects of his consumption above the current rate. Besides,
the public sights and exhibitions, which he there pays for
seeing, are expenses already incurred by the nation, which
he nowise aggravates by his presence. But these advan-
tages, though real and positive, are very limited in amount,
and must not be over-rated.</li>
<li>This has become a matter of some interest to England,
whose unproductive capitalists and proprietors have ab-
solutely overwhelmed the society of France and a great
part of Italy, where they consume an immense revenue,
derived from Britain by the export of her manufactures
without any return. Thus their native country is, pro tanto,
a producer without being a consumer the scene of exer-
tion but not of enjoyment. This circumstance, although
nowise prejudicial to her productive powers, is extremely
so to the comfort and enjoyment and content of her popu-
lation; for there are few enjoyments so personal and self-
ish, as not to be diffused in some degree or other at the
moment and place of consumption. Besides, the presence
of the proprietor is always a benefit, especially in Great
Britain, where so many public duties are gratuitously per-
formed. Ireland suffers in a worse degree; her gentry are
attracted by England as well as the continent; and the con-
sequences have long been matter of regret and complaint.
Though it might be impolitic to check the efflux by au-
thoritative measures, it should at least not be directly en-
couraged and stimulated, as it really is, by the financial
system, which the English ministry so obstinately perse-
vere in. Almost the whole of the taxation is thrown imme-
diately upon consumption; whilst the permanent sources
of production and the clear rent they yield to the idle pro-
prietor are left untouched. The proprietor has, therefore,
an obvious interest in effecting his consumption where it
is least burthened with taxation; that is to say, anywhere
but in England. His property’s protected gratuitously, and
the charge of its protection defrayed by the productive
classes, who thus are compelled to pay for the security of
other people’s property as well as their own, and are them-
selves unable to imitate their unproductive countrymen,
by running away from domestic taxation. A more unjust
and discouraging system could not have been devised. Its
evils are daily increasing, and threaten the most serious
diminution of the national resources, But the ministers nei-
ther see the mischief themselves, nor will listen to the warn-
ings of others. Many of them, indeed, have an interest in
perpetuating an exemption, by which they benefit person-
ally. Tr.
148Book I=  On Production</li>
<li>In 1796, when the new authorities of France indemni-
fied the holders of suppressed offices in paper-money, these
discarded functionaries for the most part converted their
assignats into specie, or other commodities of equal value,
which they took or sent out of the country. The conse-
quent national loss to France was nearly as great, as if
they had received their indemnities in cash=  for its paper
representative had not then suffered any material depre-
ciation. Even when the individual remains himself in the
country, he can not be prevented from transferring his for-
tune thence, if he be determined on so doing.</li>
<li>The utility of money is intense, in the compound ratio of
the division of labour and the variety of individual con-
sumption. A sugar colony in the West Indies, though highly
productive in proportion to its population, requires little
money to facilitate the transfer of the produce; because
the bulk of the population, the negroes, have very little
variety of consumption=  they are fed, clothed, &amp;c. in the
wholesale, and in the plainest and most uniform manner.
Yet, possibly, the division both of agricultural and manu-
facturing labour on each plantation may be carried to con-
siderable length. Tr.</li>

<li>When the intercourse between the Europeans and the
negroes of the river Gambia first commenced, the com-
modity most in request with them was iron, for the pur-
poses of war and of tillage. Iron, therefore, became the
standard of comparison of value. In a little time, it became
a mere nominal standard in their mercantile dealings; and
a bar of tobacco consisting of 20 or 30 leaves of that herb,
was given for a bar of rum consisting of four or five pints,
according to the abundance or scarcity of the article. In
such a state of society, each product successively performs
the functions of money in reference to all other products;
which leaves the community subject to all the inconve-
niences of barter in kind, the chief of which is, the inabil-
ity to offer any one article in general request and accepta-
tion, and capable of ready apportionment in amount to
other commodities at large. Vide Travels of Mungo Park,
vol. i. c. 2.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, book i. c. 4.</li>
<li>The money of Lacedaemon is a proof of the position,
that public authority is incompetent of itself to give cur-
rency to its money. The laws of Lycurgus directed the
money to be made of iron, purposely to prevent its being
easily hoarded, or transferred in large quantities; but they
were inoperative, because they went to defeat these, the
principal purposes of money. Yet no legislate was ever
more rigidly obeyed than Lycurgus.</li>
<li>The present silver coin of France contains one part cop-
per to nine parts fine silver; the relative value of copper to
silver being as 1 to 60, or thereabouts. So that the copper
contained in the whole silver coinage, amounts to about 1/
600 of the total value of the silver coin, or 1 cent in 6 fr.
Supposing it were attempted to disengage the copper, it
would not pay the expenses of the process of separation;
to say nothing of the value of the impression that must be
destroyed. Wherefore, it is reckoned for nothing in the
valuation of the coin. A piece of 5 fr. presents the idea of
the 221 grammes of fine silver contained in it, though ac-
tually weighing 25 gr. inclusive of the alloy. [The values
of the gold, silver, and copper coins of the United States,
were first regulated by the act of Congress of the 2d of
April, 1792, establishing the mint. By that act, the eagle
contained 247.5 grains of pure gold and 22.5 grains of
alloy, making together 270 grains of standard gold; and
the half eagle and the quarter eagle, their respective frac-
tional proportions of the same metals. By the act of Con-
gress of the 30th of June, 1834, this standard has been
debased, and the weight of the gold coins reduced=  the
eagle now contains 232 grains of pure gold and 26 grains
of alloy, making together 258 grains of standard gold; and
the half eagle and the quarter eagle are reduced in like
proportions. By the act of 1792, the standard of gold was
eleven-twelfths of pure gold to one-twelfth of alloy, or 22
carats fine. By the act of the present year, the relative fine-
ness or number of carats has been reduced to about 21.58,
equivalent to a debasement of about 1.9 per cent; and the
actual quantity of pure metal in the coin has been dimin-
ished more than 6.25 per cent — (6.262626+). The alloy
of standard gold is composed of silver and copper, not
exceeding one half silver.
In the silver coins of the United States, no change
has been made, since the act of 1792, which regulated their
value. The dollar, by that act, is made the unit, of the same
value as the Spanish milled dollar then current. The dollar
of the United States contains 371.25 grains of pure silver
and 416 grains of standard silver; the half dollar 185.625
grains of pure silver and 208 grains of standard silver; the
quarter dollar 92.8125 grains of pure silver and 104 grains
of standard silver; the dime 37.125 grains of pure silver
and 41.6 grains of standard silver; and the half dime
18.5625 grains of pure silver and 20.8 grains of standard
silver. The standard of silver is 1485 parts of fine to 179
parts alloy; accordingly, 1485 parts in 1664 parts of the
entire weight of the silver coins are of pure silver, and the
remaining 179 parts of alloy. The alloy of standard silver
is wholly composed of copper.
The copper coins of the United States are the cent
and the half cent; the weight of which, since the act of
1792, has been twice reduced. By the act of 1792, the cent
contained 264 grains, and the half cent 132 grains, of cop-
per, and the cent was fixed at the value of the hundredth
part of the dollar, or unit. By an act of the 14th of January,
1793, the cent was reduced to 208 grains, and the half
cent to 104 grains, of copper; and by an act of the 3d of
March, 1795, the President was authorized by proclama-
tion, and accordingly, on the 26th of January, 1796, re-
149Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
duced the cent to 168 grains, and the half cent to 84 grains
of copper, their present weight., The proportional mint
value of gold to silver, by the act of 1792, was as 1 of pure
gold to 15 of pure silver; and by the set of the present year
the proportional mint value of gold to silver is as 1 of pure
gold in 16.002112+ of pure silver. American Editor.</li>
<li>The other property of money, the capability of subdivi-
sion, and apportionment of the value parted with, must
not be lost sight of=  by it the jeweller is enabled to ex-

<li>Ricardo and some other writers maintain, that the charges
of obtaining the metal wholly determine its price or rela-
tive value in exchange for all other commodities. Accord-
ing to their notions, therefore, the want or demand nowise
influences that price; a position in direct contradiction to
daily and indisputable experience, which leads us invari-
ably to the conclusion, that value is increased by increase
of demand. Supposing that, by the discovery of new mines,
silver were to become as common as copper, it would be
subject to all the disqualifications of copper for the pur-
poses of money, and gold would be more generally em-
ployed. The consequent increase of the demand for gold
would increase the intensity of its value; and mines would
be worked, that are now abandoned, because they do not
defray the expense. It is true that the ore would then be
obtained at a heavier rate; but will any one deny, that the
increased value of the metal would be owing to the in-
creased demand for it? It is the increased intensity of that
demand, that determines the miner to incur the increased
charge of production.</li>
<li>Before the Bank of England can pay off its notes in cash,
the government, its principal debtor, must discharge its
debts in specie; which it can not do unless it purchase the
specie, either with its savings, or with the proceeds of fur-
ther taxation. In doing so, it would, in effect, substitute a
new and very costly engine of circulation, which must be
purchased by the state, for the present one, which, although
much out of order, and altogether destitute of intrinsic
value, is yet made to do the business well enough. [The
Bank of England, notwithstanding the opinion expressed
by the author in this note, has long since resumed and con-
tinued the payment of its notes on demand in specie; and,
it must be added, without any intention having been ex-
pressed, or attempt made, by the British government, to
“discharge its debts in specie” which M. Say seemed here
to think must be previously effected. By an act of parlia-
ment, passed in July 1819, generally known as Mr. Peel’s
Act, the Bank of England was required, from the 1st of
May, 1823, to pay its notes on demand, in the legal coins
of the realm. The final resumption of cash payments by
the Bank of England took place, however, at a still earlier
period; for, finding itself in possession of sufficient gold
to make payments in cash sooner than this law prescribed,
the bank obtained the passage of another act, which made
it imperative upon the institution to pay all demands in the
legal coin of the realm on the 1st of May, 1822, since which
time it has never ceased to “discharge its debts in specie”
when required. American Editor.]</li>
<li>It must not be supposed, that our author is ignorant of
the wide difference between Bank of England and country
bank paper, viz=  that the one is paper-money, the princi-
pal; the other, its convertible representative. This position
is perfectly correct. The credit, embodied, as it were, in
the provincial paper, is equally an agent of circulation with
the inconvertible principal, the paper-money; which, but
for its presence and rivalry, would be required in double
the quantity, to maintain the same scale of money-prices.
Great confusion hay hitherto prevailed on this subject for
want of a clear conception of the concurrent operation of
coin and its rival, credit. Tr.</li>

money, vide infra, Chap. XXII. sect. 4. where the subject
of paper-money is discussed.</li>
<li>The multiplication of paper-money, and its consequent
depreciation, effects no augmentation of the wealth of the
community, although it makes necessary a more liberal
use of figures in the estimation; just in the same way as its
valuation in wheat instead of silver would do. The total of
national wealth might be 20,000,000,000 kilogr. of wheat,
and but 25,000,000 kilogr. of silver, and yet the value pre-
cisely the same. If the value of the money be less intense,
it will inquire more of it to express the same degree of
value.</li>

<li>That is to say, to receive the certificate of coinage, for
use, not in the character of money, but as an article of
commerce. The assay is charged for at the English mint,
upon bullion re-delivered without coinage. And, before
the export of coin was made free, the risk was probably
equal to the value of the certificate conferred by coinage.
These remarks apply to the coinage of gold only, silver
being now subject to a seignorage of 4s. in 66s. But silver
is no longer the material of the metallic money, except for
minute and fractional exchanges. Tr.</li>
<li>It is hardly necessary to repeat, that the specie exported
is not so much value lost to the community; for nobody
will feel inclined to make a present of it to the foreigner.
Its value is transmitted, for the purpose of obtaining a cor-
responding value in return; but the nation loses the value
of the coinage in this operation. When guineas are exported
from England, she receives in exchange the value of the
metal only, and nothing for the impression it bears. [This
is hardly true to the full extent. The Spanish dollars pass
150Book I=  On Production
current in many countries at a considerable advance on
bullion of equal weight and fineness, and constitute the
legal currency of some communities, that have not under-
taken the business of coinage themselves; as in Hayti, and
elsewhere. The difference is the local value of the coin-
age, which is paid for sometimes very liberally. But to
whom is it paid? to the Spanish individual or to the Span-
ish government. If to the former, it is an undue advantage
to the individual at the expense of the community; if to the
latter, it is the recompense of productive agency. Were the
gold coinage of England subject to a seignorage like the
silver, it would never be exported habitually, but to such
nations as were con. tent to pay the extra value of the coin-
age. Indeed, our author presently says in express terms,
that the value of the coinage is not always lost on importa-
tion. Tr.]</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, book i. c. 5.</li>
<li>One of my German translators, the learned Professor
Morstadt, of Heidelberg, has observed upon this passage,
that since 1810, the Russian government has made no
charge for the coinage. It might with equal reason execute
gratuitously the business of letter-carriage, instead of charg-
ing for it to the individuals.
I am perhaps incorrect in saying, that most govern-
ments make a profit over and above the expense of execu-
tion. The French government charges a seignorage, equal
at most to defray the expense of the mere process. But the
interest and wear and tear of the capital vested in build-
ings, machinery, &amp;c. and the charge of administration, &amp;c.
are so much dead loss to the government; and probably
many other governments are in the same predicament.</li>
<li>The value of the coinage, or fashion of the metal, is not
always lost in the export. The impression is, to a certain
degree, a recommendation beyond the limits of the au-
thority which executes it, and raises the value somewhat
higher than that of bullion in bars.</li>
<li>The 5 fr. pieces of France, have, by their invariable uni-
formity of weight and standard since their first issue, ac-
quired a similar currency in many parts of the world.</li>
<li>This paragraph contains three errors in relation to the
coinage of dollars by the United States, and the exporta-
tion of specie, which it is of importance to point out=  1st.
Spanish dollars are not, and never have been, simply
restamped at our mint, without varying their weight or stan-
dard=  2d. A pound, troy, of Spanish dollars, contains 10
oz. 15 dwts. of fine silver=  a pound, troy, of American dol-
lars contains 10 oz. 14 dwts. 5 grains of fine silver=  3d. No
law has ever been enacted by Congress, directing the ex-
portation of specie to be made in dollars of our own coin-
age; nor has the executive the power to regulate, or in any
manner interfere with the exportation of specie from the
United States. American Editor.</li>
<li>In Spanish America, a higher duty is charged, amount-
ing, according to Humboldt, to 11 per cent on silver, and 3
per cent on gold, over and above the actual charges of
coinage; for the government allows no bullion to be ex-
ported in an uncoined state. So that, in fact, this is not a
seignorage, but a duty on exportation, exacted at the time
of converting the bullion into coin.</li>
<li>The measure of weight called a livre contained 12 oz. in
the time of Charlemagne.</li>
<li>According to the principles established supra, sect. 3 of
this chapter, there is reason to believe, that the value of
the adulterated livre of 8 oz. of fine silver might have been
kept up to that of the old livre of 12 oz., if the volume of
the coin had not been augmented. But the rise of money
prices, consequent upon the adulteration of the coin, is a
ground of presumption, that the government, with a view
to profit by this momentary operation, ordered a recoinage,
and made 12 pieces out of 8, by the addition of alloy, so as
to increase the total quantity proportionately to the reduc-
tion of the standard of quality.</li>
<li>We find in the Prolegomènes of Le Blanc, 25, that the
silver sol of St. Louis weighed 1 gros. 7½ grains, which,
multiplied by 20, makes 2 oz. 6 gros 6 grains, the livre.</li>
<li>The same expedient was resorted to by that monster of
prodigality, the Roman emperor Heliogabalus. The taxes
of the empire were payable in specific gold coin, called
aurei, and not in gold by the tale=  and the emperor, to en-
large his receipts, made a new issue of aurei, weighing as
much as 24 oz. each. The virtuous Alexander Severus,
actuated by an opposite motive, made a considerable re-
duction of the weight.</li>
<li>Philip de Valois, in his official instructions to the offic-
ers of the mint, A. D. 1350, enjoins the utmost secrecy on
the subject of the purposed adulteration, even with the
sanction of an oath, for the express purpose of taking in
the commercial classes; directing them “to put a good face
upon the matter of the course of exchange of the mark of
gold, so that the intended adulteration might not be dis-
covered.” Many similar instances are to be met with in the
reign of King John. Le Blanc, Traité Hist. des Monnaies,

<li>The term, “representative,” or “sign,” of silver or specie,
as applied to bank-notes, has no precise or definite mean-
ing. A bank-note, with no sort of accuracy can be said to
be “the representative of money;” and as such loose meta-
phorical expressions have given occasion to most of the
vague and mystical notions respecting paper-money which
151Jean-Baptise Say, A Treatise on Political Economy
have been too long current, and only serve to involve the
subject in obscurity and confusion, they cannot too soon
be discarded.
We have already seen, that coins are neither more
nor less than commodities, which are bought and sold for
their value, like other commodities. Bank-notes are not,
any more than bills of exchange, or other transferable en-
gagements for the payment of money, the representatives
or symbols of these commodities, but are actual obliga-
tions for the payment, on demand, or at a stated time, of
the quantity of the coins expressed on the face of them,
and are themselves received in payment as readily as specie
itself, only when it is perfectly understood that the specie
can be obtained for them, or when it is generally known,
thus they will be as readily received in the market as the
coins which they specify. American Editor.</li>
<li>If credit-paper be thrown into the scale, it will not help
us over this difficulty. The agent of circulation, whether in
form of specie or of paper, can ever exceed in amount the
total utility vested in it. The expansion of the volume of a
national money, whether of metal or of paper, is sure to be
followed by a proportionate dilution of its value, which
disables the whole from being equal to the purchase of a
greater portion of commodities at large=  and the value,
devoted to the business of circulation, is always a trifle,
compared with the value it is employed to circulate. Vide

<li>Wealth of Nations, book i. c. 5. On this point, Smith
observes, that “labour was the first price, the original pur-
chase-money, that was paid for all things. It was not by
gold or silver, but by labour, that all the wealth of the world
was originally purchased.” I think I have succeeded in prov-
ing that he is mistaken. Nature executes an essential part
of the production of values; and her agency is in most cases
paid for, and forms a portion of the value of the product.
The profit of land, which is called rent, is paid to the pro-
prietor, who does nothing himself, and stands in place of
the original occupant; and it affects the value of the prod-
uct, raised by the joint agency of nature and industry; the
portion of value contributed by nature is not the product
of human labour. Capital also, which is, for the most part,
the accumulated product of labour, concurs, like nature,
in the business of production, and receives in recompense
a portion of the product; but the gains, accruing to the
capitalist, are quite distinct from the accumulated labour
vested in the capital itself, which can be expended or con-
sumed in toto, by one set of persons; while its share in the
product, in other words, the interest paid for its use; may
be consumed by another.</li>

<li>12 oz. of silver were given for 1 oz. of gold, in Cesar’s
time. Wherefore, silver having fallen in the ratio of 4 to 1,
1 oz. of gold was worth as much m his days, as 48 oz. of
pure silver at the present period. But 48 oz. of silver are
now worth 3 oz. of gold or thereabouts=  so that gold must
have fallen in the ratio of about 3 to 1.</li>
<li>The same error of calculation has led these translators
involuntarily to underrate the prodigality of the worst of
the emperors. Thus we are told, that Caligula, in less than
a year, squandered the whole of the treasure accumulated
by Tiberius, amounting to 2700 millions of sestertii, which
La Harpe translates into no more than 540 millions of
livres=  whereas, supposing the value of gold to have var-
ied little between the days of Caesar and of Caligula, which
is probable enough, it will be found to amount to very
nearly 3000 millions of livres. Indeed, it seems hardly
possible, that a less sum would have sufficed for the mon-
strous extravagancies recorded of him.
Horace, Epist. 2. lib. ii. speaks of an estate, that,
from the context, must have been a considerable one, as
being of the value of 300,000 sestertii, which, according
to my view, amounted to 303,600 fr. (about 56,470 dol-
lars) of our present money. His commentator, Dacier, per-
verts the meaning of the passage, by estimating the estate
in question, at 22,500 fr. only, or 4185 dollars.</li>
<li>Le Blanc. Traité Monnaies, p. 3. estimates the Roman
lb. of 12 oz. at the actual weight of only 10 2/3 oz. of our
standard, taking as a guide, the weight of some of the coins
of the emperors which are in a state of high preservation
The valuation I have here given of the oz. of gold, takes it
at the mint standard, viz., with a proportion of 1/10 alloy;
for I take it for granted, that the gold, thus laid hands upon
by Caesar, was not pure gold, but coin with a mixture of
alloy.</li>
<li>Until the period specified, the ratio of gold to silver in
Europe was 1 to 12. At present, it is in most nations of Eu-
152Book I=  On Production
rope 1 to 14, or 1 to 15; so that taking the average ratio in
ancient times at 1 to 11¼ and in modern times at 1 to 15,
gold will have increased in relative value to silver in the
proportion of 4 to 3. Wherefore, if gold be multiplied by 3,
and silver by 4, the result will be equal.</li>
<li>I am disposed to believe, that the value of both gold and
silver began again to decline about the commencement of
the present century; for more gold and silver are now given
for most of the commodities least liable to vary in the costs
of production. [In the very able and laborious “Historical
Inquiry into the Production and Consumption of the Pre-
cious Metals, by William Jacobs, Esq. F. R. S. London, 1831,”
we are furnished with a chapter (xxv) on the production of
gold and silver from the end of the year 1809 to the end of</li>
<li>The author remarks, “that it was at the first named
period, 1809, when a great change took place in the produc-
tion of the mines of gold and silver, in every part of the west-
ern continent, after a space of more than three centuries,
during the whole of which there had been a constant increase
of the quantities obtained; each succeeding decennial pe-
riod yielding a larger portion than the similar number of years
that preceded it; and though they have in some measure been
restored, it has been by slow degrees, and they are yet very
far from having approached the copious produce which they
yielded before their general abruption from European gov-
ernment.” After then examining the productiveness of the
mines of Mexico, Colombia, including New Grenada, Peru,
Buenos Ayres, Chili, and Brazil, in gold and silver, and also
after taking notice of the gold found in North and South Caro-
lina and Georgia, from 1824 to 1830, he sums up the whole
of the amount of the gold and silver supplied by the late
Spanish dominions in America, during the twenty years, from
the end of the year 1809 to the end of 1829, thus=
twenty years mentioned, at 13 per cent. American Edi-
tor.]</li>
<li>The relative position of gold and silver, in respect to
value, is by no means determined by the respective supply
of each from the mines. Humboldt states, in his Essai Pol.
sur la Nouvelle Espagne, tom. iv. p. 222, oct., that silver
is produced from the mines of America and Europe jointly,
in the ratio to gold, of 45 to 1. Now the ratio of their value,
instead of being 45 to 1, is only,

The difference is probably owing to the superior
utility and demand of silver for the purposes of plate, &amp;c.
as well as of money. It would seem, that this cause oper-
ates more forcibly in the East than in the West; for gold
jewellery is relatively cheaper there than in our part of the
world.</li>

the diminution in the mass of metallic money, during the

probably never be revived. In fact they are clumsy expe-
dients, suited only to the early stages of commercial pros-
perity, and are liable to many inconveniences. They hold
out a strong temptation to internal fraud and violence, as
well as to external rapacity; they withdraw from active
utility a large portion of the precious metals, which might
perhaps be turned to better account elsewhere; and they
yield a degree of facility of circulation nowise superior to
what may be afforded by the a common process of bank-
ing, except perhaps in security, and infinitely more expen-
sive to the public and to individuals. They have accord-
ingly been everywhere supplanted by banks of circulation,
or by the expedient of an inconvertible paper-money. Tr.</li>
<li>The two methods resolve themselves practically into one;
for merchants ut good credit can always procure discount-
able paper; and the sole essential difference is, that, in one
case, the credit is individual and unevidenced, in the other,
evidenced, and, in most cases, joint also. The bank of En-
gland requires the names of more than one firm on the
paper it discounts. Country bankers often content them-
selves with the security, or note of hand, of the borrower
alone. Tr.</li>

<li>Since the first publication of this passage, this very cir-
cumstance has happened in respect to the bank of Paris, in
1814 and 1815, when that capital was besieged and occu-
pied by the allied armies. The advances of the bank to the
government, and to individuals, which could not be re-
called immediately, did not exceed the capital of the es-
tablishment, for which the shareholders can not be called
upon; and its paper-issues, payable to bearer, were all cov-
ered, either by specie in hand, or by commercial paper of
short dates. By this means, notwithstanding the very criti-
cal circumstances of the moment, the merchants contin-
ued to employ its notes=  which they could not- well do
without; and they were paid as usual in cash without inter-
ruption, during the whole of the hostile occupation=  which
shows at once the utility of a bank of circulation, and the
advantage of leaving inviolate the convertibility of paper-
issues.</li>
<li>In 1803, the land-bank of Paris was, for this reason,
obliged to suspend the payment of its notes in cash; and to
give notice, that they would be paid off by instalments out
of the proceeds of its real securities.</li>
<li>That is to say, advances its notes. A bank, like an indi-
vidual, may advance its capital, which then becomes more
or less vested and fixed. The whole capital of the bank of
England has been thus advanced; and there would have
been no danger, had it not advanced its notes also. When
the advances of paper ire made upon transferable securi-
ties, stock, exchequer bills, and the like, those securities
may be sold for cash, or for the notes of the bank itself, so
long as they retain their value, and thus the safety and sol-
vency of the bank maintained. But this operation is unnec-
essarily complex; for the government might itself have sold,
and thus have saved the brokerage or profit accruing upon
the opera lion to the bank. Tr.</li>
<li>Thornton, in his tract on the Paper Credit of Great Brit-
ain, written expressly with a view to justify the suspen-
sion of cash-payments by that establishment, has attacked
the positions of Smith upon this subject. He tells us, that
the extraordinary run upon the bank, which brought about
the suspension, was occasioned, not by the excess of its
issues, but, on the contrary, by their partial contraction.
“An excessive limitation of bank-notes,” he observes, “will
produce failures, failures must cause consternation, and
consternation must lead to a run upon the bank for guin-
eas.” By this reference to an extreme case, he endeavours
to support his paradoxical opinions. When a convertible
paper has succeeded in driving out of the country too large
a portion of the metallic money, and the confidence in the
paper happens suddenly to decline, great confusion and
embarrassment will doubtless ensue, because the remain-
ing agent of circulation is insufficient to effect the busi-
ness; but it is a great mistake to suppose, that the defi-
ciency can be remedied by the multiplication of a paper,
not enjoying the confidence of the public. If the bank of
England was able to survive the shock, it was because of
the indispensable necessity of some agent of transfer, of
some money or other, of paper in default of all others, in
so commercial a country; because the government and the
bankers of London, who were interested in the safety of
the bank, unanimously agreed not to call upon it for cash,
until it should be in a condition to pay, that is to say, until
the government should have paid its advances in actual
value. The bank had lent to the government more than its
whole capital; for to that extent it might have gone with
safety, its capital not being wanted for the discharge or
convertibility of its paper; had it not so lone, the short
bills in its possession would have been sufficient for the
extinction of its convertible paper.</li>
<li>Wealth of Nations, book ii. chap. 2.</li>
<li>Wherever a paper-money has been established, the dif-
ference between its value in the home market, where it has
utility, and its value in foreign markets, where it has no
utility, has afforded a fruitful field for speculation, that
has enriched many adventurers. In 1811, 100 guineas in
gold would purchase at Paris a bill of exchange on Lon-
don, for £140 sterling, payable in the paper which was the
only currency of England. Yet the difference between gold
and paper in the London market at the same period, was
only 15 per cent. It was in this way, that the paper was of
higher value in England than abroad. Accordingly, I find
from returns with which I have been favoured, that gold in
guineas or bullion was smuggled into the ports of Dunkirk
154Book I=  On Production
and Gravelines alone, in the years 1810, 11, 12, and 13, to
the amount of 33,875,090 dollars. There was a similar
speculation in other commodities at large; but it was at-
tended with more risk and difficulty; the import into France
being very hazardous, although the export from England
was encouraged in every possible way. Yet this traffic
would soon have found its level, for it must have produced
bills on England in such quantity, as to have brought the
exchange to par at least, had not the continental subsidies
of England furnished a continual supply of bills on Lon-
don without any return.</li>
