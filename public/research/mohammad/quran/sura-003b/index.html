 Believers are not to take disbelievers forfriends instead of believers. Whoever does that has nothing to do with Allah, unless it is to protect your own selves against them. Allah warns you to beware of Him.</p>

 When she delivered her, she said, “My Lord, I have delivered a female and the male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and have commended her and her descendants to Your protection, from Satan the outcast.”</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>
<p>Her Lord accepted her with a gracious reception, and brought her a beautiful upbring-
ing, and entrusted her to the care of Zechariah. Whenever Zechariah entered upon her
in the sanctuary, he found her with provision.
He said, “O Mary, where did you get this from?” She said, “It is from Allah; Allah provides to whom He wills without reckoning.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thereupon Zechariah prayed to his Lord; he said, “My Lord, bestow on me good off-
spring from Your presence; You are the Hearer of Prayers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the angels called out to him, as he stood praying in the sanctuary: “Allah gives you good news of John; confirming a Word from Allah, and honorable, and moral, and a prophet; one of the upright.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “My Lord, how will I have a son, when old age has overtaken me, and my wife is barren?” He said, “Even so, Allah does whatever He wills.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said, “Your sign is that you shall not speak to the people for three days, except by gestures. And remember your Lord much, and praise in the evening and the morning.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The angels said, “O Mary, Allah has chosen you, and has purified you. He has chosen you over all the women of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O Mary, be devoted to your Lord, and bow down, and kneel with those who kneel.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are accounts from the Unseen, which We reveal to you. You were not with them when they cast their lots as to which of them would take charge of Mary; nor were you with them as they quarreled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Angels said, “O Mary, Allah gives you good news of a Word from Him. His name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, well-esteemed in this world and the next, and one of
the nearest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will speak to the people from the crib, and in adulthood, and will be one of the righteous.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She said, “My Lord, how can I have a child, when no man has touched me?” He said, “It will be so. Allah creates whatever He wills. To have anything done, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A messenger to the Children of Israel: “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord.
I make for you out of clay the figure of a bird.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>then I breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the
leprous, and I revive the dead, by Allah’s leave. And I inform you concerning what you eat, and what you store in your homes. In that
is a sign for you, if you are believers.”</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>
<p>“And verifying what lies before me of the Torah, and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord; so fear Allah, and obey me.”</p>

<li>
<p>“Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Jesus sensed disbelief on their part, he said, “Who are my allies towards Allah?” The disciples said, “We are Allah’s allies; we have believed in Allah, and bear witness that we submit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our Lord, we have believed in what You have revealed, and we have followed the Messenger, so count us among the witnesses.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They planned, and Allah planned; but Allah is the Best of planners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah said, “O Jesus, I am terminating your life, and raising you to Me, and clearing you of those who disbelieve. And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then to Me is your return; then I will judge between you regarding what you were disputing.</p>

<p>As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment, in this world
and the next, and they will have no helpers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And as for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their rewards in full.
Allah does not love the unjust.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what We recite to you of the Verses and the Wise Reminder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likeness of Jesus in Allah’s sight is that of Adam: He created him from dust, then
said to him, “Be,” and he was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The truth is from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if anyone disputes with you about him, after the knowledge that has come to you, say, “Come, let us call our children and your children, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves, and let us invoke Allah’s curse on the liars.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the narrative of truth: there is no god but Allah. Allah is the Mighty, the Wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if they turn away—Allah knows the corrupt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “O People of the Book, come to terms common between us and you: that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate
nothing with Him, and that none of us takes others as lords besides Allah.” And if they
turn away, say, “Bear witness that we have submitted.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O People of the Book! Why do you argue about Abraham, when the Torah and the
Gospel were not revealed until after him?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Will you not reason?</p>
<ol start="66">
<li>
<p>Here you are—you argue about things you know, but why do you argue about things you
do not know? Allah knows, and you do not know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian. But he was a Monotheist, a Muslim, not a Polytheist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people most deserving of Abraham are those who followed him, and this prophet,
and those who believe. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A party of the People of the Book would love to lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray, and they do not realize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O People of the Book! Why do you reject the revelations of Allah, even as you witness?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood, and knowingly conceal the truth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the People of the Book say, “Believe in what was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day, and reject it at its
end, so that they may return.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And trust none except those who follow your religion.” Say, “Guidance is Allah’s guidance. If someone is given the like of what you were given, or they argue with you before your Lord, say, “All grace is in Allah’s hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He gives it to whomever He wills.” Allah is Bounteous and Knowing.</p>
<ol start="74">
<li>
<p>He specifies His mercy for whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of Sublime Grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the People of the Book is he, who, if you entrust him with a heap of gold, he will give it back to you. And among them is he, who, if you entrust him with a single coin, he will not give it back to you, unless you keep after him. That is because they say, “We are
under no obligation towards the gentiles.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They tell lies about Allah, and they know it.</p>
<ol start="76">
<li>
<p>Indeed, whoever fulfills his commitments and maintains piety—Allah loves the pious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who exchange the covenant of Allah, and their vows, for a small price, will have no
share in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on
the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. They will have a painful punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And among them are those who twist the Scripture with their tongues, that you may
think it from the Scripture, when it is not from the Scripture. And they say, “It is from
Allah,” when it is not from Allah. They tell lies and attribute them to Allah, knowingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No person to whom Allah has given the Scripture, and wisdom, and prophethood would ever say to the people, “Be my wor-
shipers rather than Allah’s.” Rather, “Be people of the Lord, according to the Scripture
you teach, and the teachings you learn.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nor would he command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would he
command you to infidelity after you have submitted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah received the covenant of the prophets, “Inasmuch as I have given you of scrip-
ture and wisdom; should a messenger come to you verifying what you have, you shall be-
lieve in him, and support him.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He said, “Do you affirm My covenant and take it upon yourselves?” They said, “We affirm it.” He
said, “Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.”</p>
<p>Whoever turns away after that—these are the deceitful.</p>
<ol start="83">
<li>
<p>Do they desire other than the religion of Allah, when to Him has submitted everything in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “We believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to
Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between
any of them, and to Him we submit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in
the Hereafter he will be among the losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will Allah guide a people who disbelieved after having believed, and had wit-
nessed that the Messenger is true, and the clear proofs had come to them? Allah does
not guide the unjust people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those—their penalty is that upon them falls the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remaining in it eternally, without their punishment being eased from them, and
without being reprieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except those who repent afterwards, and reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for those who disbelieve after having believed, then plunge deeper into disbelief,
their repentance will not be accepted; these are the lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for those who disbelieve and die disbelievers, even the earth full of gold would not
be accepted from any of them, were he to offer it for ransom. These will have a painful
torment, and will have no saviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will not attain virtuous conduct until you give of what you cherish. Whatever you
give away, Allah is aware of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All food was permissible to the Children of Israel, except what Israel forbade for itself before the Torah was revealed. Say, “Bring the Torah, and read it, if you are truthful.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever forges lies about Allah after that—these are the unjust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham the Monotheist; he was not a Pagan.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first house established for mankind is the one at Bekka; blessed, and guidance for all
people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In it are evident signs; the Station of Abra-
ham. Whoever enters it attains security. Pil-
grimage to the House is a duty to Allah for all
who can make the journey. But as for those
who refuse—Allah is Independent of the
worlds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“O People of the Scripture, why do you reject the Revelations of Allah, when Allah witnesses what you do?”</li>
<li>“O People of the Scripture, why do you hinder from Allah’s path those who believe, seeking to distort it, even though you are wit-
nesses? Allah is not unaware of what you do.”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="100">
<li>
<p>O you who believe! If you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture, they will
turn you, after your belief, into disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And how could you disbelieve, when Allah’s revelations are being recited to you, and
among you is His Messenger? Whoever cleaves to Allah has been guided to a straight
path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Revere Allah with due reverence, and do not die except as Muslims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And hold fast to the rope of Allah, altogether, and do not become divided. And remember Allah’s blessings upon you; how you were enemies, and He reconciled your hearts,
and by His grace you became brethren. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He
saved you from it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Allah thus clarifies His revelations for you, so that you may be guided.</p>
<ol start="104">
<li>
<p>And let there be among you a community calling to virtue, and advocating righteousness, and deterring from evil.
These are the successful.
And do not be like those who separated and disputed after the clear proofs came to
them; for them is a great punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Day when some faces will be whitened, and some faces will be blackened. As
for those whose faces are blackened: “Did you disbelieve after your belief?” Then taste the
punishment for having disbelieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But as for those whose faces are whitened: they are in Allah’s mercy, remaining in it forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are the revelations of Allah. We recite them to you in truth. Allah desires no in-
justice for mankind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth, and to Allah all
events are referred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the best community that ever emerged for humanity: you advocate what is
moral, and forbid what is immoral, and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Scripture
believed, it would have been better for them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Among them are the believers, but most of them are sinners.</p>
<ol start="111">
<li>
<p>They will do you no harm, beyond insulting you. And if they fight you, they will turn
around and flee, then they will not be helped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They shall be humiliated wherever they are encountered, except through a rope from
Allah, and a rope from the people; and they incurred wrath from Allah, and were stricken
with misery. That is because they rejected Allah’s revelations, and killed the prophets un-
justly. That is because they rebelled and committed aggression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not alike. Among the People of the Scripture is a community that is upright;
they recite Allah’s revelations throughout the night, and they prostrate themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They believe in Allah and the Last Day, and advocate righteousness and forbid evil,
and are quick to do good deeds. These are among the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. Allah knows the righteous.

As for those who disbelieve, neither their possessions nor their children will avail them
anything against Allah. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, abiding therein forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a frosty wind that strikes
the harvest of a people who have wronged
their souls, and destroys it. Allah did not
wrong them, but they wronged their own
selves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Do not befriend out-
siders who never cease to wish you harm.
They love to see you suffer. Hatred has al-
ready appeared from their mouths, but what
their hearts conceal is worse. We have made
the messages clear for you, if you understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There you are, you love them, but they do
not love you, and you believe in the entire
scripture. And when they meet you, they say,
“We believe;” but when they are alone, they
bite their fingers in rage at you. Say, “Die in
your rage; Allah knows what is within the
hearts.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If something good happens to you, it up-
sets them; but if something bad befalls you,
they rejoice at it. But if you persevere and
maintain righteousness, their schemes will
not harm you at all. Allah comprehends what
they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when you left your home in the
morning, to assign battle-positions for the
believers. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When two groups among you almost fal-
tered, but Allah was their Protector. So in Al-
lah let the believers put their trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah had given you victory at Badr, when
you were weak. So fear Allah, that you may be
thankful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you said to the believers, “Is it not
enough for you that your Lord has reinforced
you with three thousand angels, sent down?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is; but if you persevere and remain cau-
tious, and they attack you suddenly, your
Lord will reinforce you with five thousand
angels, well trained.
Allah made it but a message of hope for
you, and to reassure your hearts thereby. Vic-
tory comes only from Allah the Almighty, the
Wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He thus cuts off a section of those who dis-
believed, or subdues them, so they retreat dis-
appointed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is no concern of yours whether He re-
deems them or punishes them. They are
wrongdoers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
ens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills,
and He punishes whom He wills. Allah is
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Do not feed on usury,
compounded over and over, and fear Allah,
so that you may prosper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And guard yourselves against the Fire that
is prepared for the disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And obey Allah and the Messenger, that
you may obtain mercy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And race towards forgiveness from your
Lord, and a Garden as wide as the heavens
and the earth, prepared for the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who give in prosperity and adver-
sity, and those who restrain anger, and those
who forgive people. Allah loves the doers of
good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And those who, when they commit an in-
decency or wrong themselves, remember Al-
lah and ask forgiveness for their sins—and
who forgives sins except Allah? And they do
not persist in their wrongdoing while they
know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those—their reward is forgiveness from
their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers
flow, abiding therein forever. How excellent
is the reward of the workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many societies have passed away before
you. So travel the earth and note the fate of
the deniers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a proclamation to humanity, and
guidance, and advice for the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And do not waver, nor feel remorse. You
are the superior ones, if you are believers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a wound afflicts you, a similar wound
has afflicted the others. Such days We alter-
nate between the people, that Allah may
know those who believe, and take martyrs
from among you. Allah does not love the evil-
doers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So that Allah may prove those who believe,
and eliminate the disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or do you expect to enter Paradise, before
Allah has distinguished those among you
who strive, and before He has distinguished
the steadfast?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You used to wish for death before you
have faced it. Now you have seen it before
your own eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muhammad is no more than a messenger.
Messengers have passed on before him. If he
dies or gets killed, will you turn on your
heels? He who turns on his heels will not
harm Allah in any way. And Allah will re-
ward the appreciative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No soul can die except by Allah’s leave, at
a predetermined time. Whoever desires the
reward of the world, We will give him some
of it; and whoever desires the reward of the
Hereafter, We will give him some of it; and
We will reward the appreciative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many a prophet fought alongside
him numerous godly people? They did not
waver for what afflicted them in the cause of
Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they give
in. Allah loves those who endure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their only words were, “Our Lord, forgive
us our offences, and our excesses in our con-
duct, and strengthen our foothold, and help
us against the disbelieving people.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Allah gave them the reward of this
world, and the excellent reward of the Here-
after. Allah loves the doers of good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! If you obey those who
disbelieve, they will turn you back on your
heels, and you end up losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah
is your Master, and He is the Best of
Helpers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will throw terror into the hearts of
those who disbelieve, because they attribute
to Allah partners for which He revealed no
sanction. Their lodging is the Fire. Miserable
is the lodging of the evildoers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah has fulfilled His promise to you, and
you defeated them by His leave; until when
you faltered, and disputed the command, and
disobeyed after He had shown you what you
like. Some of you want this world, and some
of you want the next. Then He turned you
away from them, to test you; but He par-
doned you. Allah is Gracious towards the be-
lievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when you fled, not caring for
anyone, even though the Messenger was call-
ing you from your rear. Then He repaid you
with sorrow upon sorrow, so that you would
not grieve over what you missed, or for what
afflicted you. Allah is Informed of what you
do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then after the setback, He sent down se-
curity upon you. Slumber overcame some of
you, while others cared only for themselves,
thinking of Allah thoughts that were un-
true—thoughts of ignorance—saying, “Is an-
ything up to us?” Say, “Everything is up to Al-
lah.” They conceal within themselves what
they do not reveal to you. And they say, “If it
was up to us, none of us would have been
killed here.” Say, “Even if you Had stayed in
your homes, those destined to be killed would
have marched into their death beds.” Allah
thus tests what is in your minds, and purifies
what is in your hearts. Allah knows what the
hearts contain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those of you who turned back on the day
when the two armies clashed—it was Satan
who caused them to backslide, on account of
some of what they have earned. But Allah has
forgiven them. Allah is Forgiving and Pru-
dent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Do not be like those
who disbelieved, and said of their brethren who marched in the land, or went on the of-
fensive, “Had they stayed with us, they would
not have died or been killed.” So that Allah
may make it a cause of regret in their hearts.
Allah gives life and causes death. Allah is Seeing of what you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are killed in the cause of Allah, or die—forgiveness and mercy from Allah are
better than what they hoard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you die, or are killed—to Allah you will be gathered up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is by of grace from Allah that you were gentle with them. Had you been harsh, hard-
hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the
conduct of affairs. And when you make a decision, put your trust in Allah; Allah loves the
trusting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Allah supports you, there is none who
can overcome you. But if He fails you, who is
there to help you after Him? So in Allah let
the believers put their trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not for a prophet to act dishonestly.
Whoever acts dishonestly will bring his dis-
honesty on the Day of Resurrection. Then
every soul will be paid in full for what it has
earned, and they will not be wronged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is someone who pursues Allah&rsquo;s approval
the same as someone who incurs Allah&rsquo;s
wrath and his refuge is Hell—the miserable
destination?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have different ranks with Allah, and
Allah is Seeing of what they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah has blessed the believers, as He
raised up among them a messenger from
among themselves, who recites to them His
revelations, and purifies them, and teaches
them the Scripture and wisdom; although be-
fore that they were in evident error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when a calamity befell you, even after
you had inflicted twice as much, you said,
“How is this?” Say, “It is from your own
selves.” Allah is Able to do all things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What befell you on the day the two armies
clashed was with Allah’s permission; that He
may know the believers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that He may know the hypocrites.
And it was said to them, “Come, fight in the
cause of Allah, or contribute.” They said, “If
we knew how to fight, we would have fol-
lowed you.” On that day they were closer to
infidelity than they were to faith. They say
with their mouths what is not in their hearts;
but Allah knows what they hide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who said of their brethren, as they
stayed behind, “Had they obeyed us, they
would not have been killed.” Say, “Then avert
death from yourselves, if you are truthful.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not consider those killed in the cause
of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive, at their
Lord, well provided for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delighting in what Allah has given them
out of His grace, and happy for those who
have not yet joined them; that they have
nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They rejoice in grace from Allah, and
bounty, and that Allah will not waste the re-
ward of the faithful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who responded to Allah and the
Messenger, despite the persecution they had
suffered. For the virtuous and the pious
among them is a great reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those to whom the people have said, “The
people have mobilized against you, so fear
them.” But this only increased them in faith,
and they said, “Allah is enough for us; He is
the Excellent Protector.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So they came back with grace from Allah,
and bounty, and no harm having touched
them. They pursued what pleases Allah. Al-
lah possesses immense grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is only Satan frightening his parti-
sans; so do not fear them, but fear Me, if you
are believers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And do not be saddened by those who
rush into disbelief. They will not harm Allah
in the least. Allah desires to give them no
share in the Hereafter. A terrible torment
awaits them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who exchange blasphemy for faith
will not harm Allah in the least. A painful tor-
ment awaits them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who disbelieve should not assume
that We respite them for their own good. In
fact, We only respite them so that they may
increase in sinfulness. A humiliating torment
awaits them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah will not leave the believers as you
are, without distinguishing the wicked from
the sincere. Nor will Allah inform you of the
future, but Allah elects from among His mes-
sengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah
and His messengers. If you believe and prac-
tice piety, you will have a splendid reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who withhold what Allah has given
them of his bounty should not assume that is
good for them. In fact, it is bad for them.
They will be encircled by their hoardings on
the Day of Resurrection. To Allah belongs the
inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and
Allah is well acquainted with what you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah has heard the statement of those
who said, “Allah is poor, and we are rich.” We
will write down what they said, and their
wrongful killing of the prophets; and We will
say, “Taste the torment of the burning.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“This is on account of what your hands
have forwarded, and because Allah is not un-
just towards the creatures.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who said, “Allah has made a cove-
nant with us, that we shall not believe in any
messenger unless he brings us an offering to
be consumed by fire.” Say, “Messengers have
come to you before me with proofs, and with
what you asked for; so why did you assassi-
nate them, if you are truthful?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they accuse you of lying, messengers be-
fore you were accused of lying. They came
with the proofs, and the Psalms, and the Illu-
minating Scripture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every soul will have a taste of death, and
you will receive your recompense on the Day
of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire, and admitted to Paradise, has won. The
life of this world is merely enjoyment of delusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be tested through your posses-
sions and your persons; and you will hear
from those who received the Scripture before
you, and from the idol worshipers, much
abuse. But if you persevere and lead a right-
eous life—that indeed is a mark of great de-
termination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah received a pledge from those who
were given the Scripture: “You shall proclaim
it to the people, and not conceal it.” But they
disregarded it behind their backs, and ex-
changed it for a small price. What a miserable
exchange they made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not think that those who rejoice in
what they have done, and love to be praised
for what they have not done—do not think
they can evade the punishment. They will
have a painful punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the
heavens and the earth. Allah has power over
all things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the creation of the heavens and the
earth, and in the alternation of night and day,
are signs for people of understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who remember Allah while stand-
ing, and sitting, and on their sides; and they
reflect upon the creation of the heavens and
the earth: “Our Lord, You did not create this
in vain, glory to You, so protect us from the
punishment of the Fire.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our Lord, whomever You commit to the Fire, You have disgraced. The wrongdoers will have no helpers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our Lord, we have heard a caller calling to the faith: `Believe in your Lord,&rsquo; and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit our misdeeds, and make us die in the company of the virtuous.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Our Lord, and give us what You have promised us through Your messengers, and
do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Surely You never break a promise.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so their Lord answered them: “I will not waste the work of any worker among you, whether male or female.
You are one of another. For those who emigrated, and were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted because of Me, and fought and were killed—I will remit for them their sins, and will admit them into gardens beneath which rivers flow—a reward from Allah. With Allah is the ultimate reward.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not be impressed by the disbelievers’ movements in the land.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brief enjoyment, then their abode is Hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for those who feared their Lord: for them will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever—hospitality from Allah. What Allah possesses is
best for the just.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah, and in what was revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They are humble before Allah, and
they do not sell Allah’s revelations for a cheap price. These will have their reward with their Lord.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
