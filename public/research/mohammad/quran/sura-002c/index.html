                        <ol start="87">
<li>We gave Moses the Scripture, and sent a succession of messengers after him. And We
gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is it that whenever a messenger comes to you with anything your souls do not desire, you grew
arrogant, calling some impostors, and killing others?</p>
<ol start="88">
<li>
<p>And they said, “Our hearts are sealed.” Rather, Allah has cursed them for their ingrati-
tude. They have little faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when a scripture came to them from Allah, confirming what they have—although previously they were seeking victory against those who disbelieved—but when there came to them what they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So Allah’s curse is upon the disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miserable is what they sold their souls for—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of
resentment that Allah would send down His grace upon whomever He chooses from
among His servants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers.
And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they say, “We be-
lieve in what was revealed to us,” and they reject anything beyond that, although it is the
truth which confirms what they have.</p>
<p>Say, “Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if
you were believers?”</p>
<ol start="92">
<li>
<p>Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you
were in the wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: “Take what We
have given you firmly, and listen.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They said, “We hear and disobey.” And their hearts be-
came filled with the love of the calf because of
their disbelief. Say, “Wretched is what your
faith commands you to do, if you are believ-
ers.”</p>
<ol start="94">
<li>
<p>Say, “If the Final Home with Allah is yours
alone, to the exclusion of all other people,
then wish for death if you are sincere.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But they will never wish for it, because of
what their hands have forwarded. Allah is
aware of the evildoers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will find them, of all mankind, the
most eager for life, even more than the poly-
theists. Every one of them wishes he could
live a thousand years; but to be granted a long
life will not nudge him from the punishment.
Allah is Seeing of what they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel—it is
he who revealed it to your heart by Allah’s
leave, confirming what preceded it, and guid-
ance and good news for the believers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever is hostile to Allah, and His angels,
and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Mi-
chael—Allah is hostile to the faithless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have revealed to you clear signs, and
none rejects them except the sinners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it not that whenever they make a cove-
nant, some of them toss it aside? In fact, most
of them do not believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when there came to them a messen-
ger from Allah, confirming what they had, a
faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs,
as if they do not know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solo-
mon who disbelieved, but it was the devils
who disbelieved. They taught the people
witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon
to the two angels Harut and Marut. They did
not teach anybody until they had said, “We
are a test, so do not lose faith.” But they
learned from them the means to cause sepa-
ration between man and his wife. But they
cannot harm anyone except with Allah&rsquo;s per-
mission. And they learned what would harm
them and not benefit them. Yet they knew
that whoever deals in it will have no share in
the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold
their souls for, if they only knew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had they believed and been righteous, the
reward from Allah would have been better, if
they only knew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Do not say ambiguous
words, but say words of respect, and listen.
The disbelievers will have a painful torment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is never the wish of the disbelievers from
among the People of the Book, nor of the pol-
ytheists, that any good should be sent down
to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for
His mercy whomever He wills. Allah is Pos-
sessor of Sublime Grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be
forgotten, unless We bring one better than it,
or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah
is capable of all things?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you not know that to Allah belongs the
sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and
that apart from Allah you have no guardian
or helper?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or do you want to question your Messen-
ger as Moses was questioned before? Who-
ever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed
from the right path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of the People of the Book wish to
turn you back into unbelievers after you have
believed, out of envy on their part, after the
Truth has become clear to them. But pardon and overlook, until Allah brings His com-
mand. Allah has power over all things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And perform the prayer, and give alms.
Whatever good you forward for yourselves,
you will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of
everything you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they say, “None will enter Heaven un-
less he is a Jew or a Christian.” These are their
wishes. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are
truthful.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, whoever submits himself to Allah,
and is a doer of good, will have his reward
with his Lord—they have nothing to fear, nor
shall they grieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jews say, “The Christians are not
based on anything;” and the Christians say,
“The Jews are not based on anything.” Yet
they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ig-
norant said the same thing. Allah will judge
between them on the Day of Resurrection re-
garding their differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is more unjust than him who forbids
the remembrance of Allah’s name in places of
worship, and contributes to their ruin? These
ought not to enter them except in fear. For
them is disgrace in this world, and for them
is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Allah belong the East and the West.
Whichever way you turn, there is Allah’s
presence. Allah is Omnipresent and Omnis-
cient.

And they say, “Allah has begotten a son.”
Be He glorified. Rather, His is everything in
the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to
Him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Originator of the heavens and the earth.
Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it,
“Be,” and it becomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who do not know say, “If only Allah
would speak to us, or a sign would come to
us.” Thus said those who were before them.
Their hearts are alike. We have made the
signs clear for people who are certain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have sent you with the truth—bring-
ing good news, and giving warnings. You will
not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jews and the Christians will not ap-
prove of you, unless you follow their creed.
Say, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.”
Should you follow their desires, after the
knowledge that has come to you, you will
have in Allah neither guardian nor helper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those to whom We have given the Scrip-
ture follow it, as it ought to be followed—
these believe in it. But as for those who reject
it—these are the losers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
ing which I bestowed upon you, and that I
have favored you over all people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And beware of a Day when no soul will
avail another soul in any way, and no ransom
will be accepted from it, and no intercession
will benefit it, and they will not be helped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when his Lord tested Abraham with
certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said,
“I am making you a leader of humanity.” He
said, “And my descendants?” He said, “My
pledge does not include the wrongdoers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And We made the House a focal point for
the people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of
Abraham as a place of prayer. And We com-
missioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify
My House for those who circle around it, and
those who seclude themselves in it, and those
who kneel and prostrate.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Abraham said, “O My Lord, make
this a peaceful land, and provide its people
with fruits—whoever of them believes in Al-
lah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever
disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment,
then I will consign him to the punishment of
the Fire; how miserable the destiny!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Abraham raises the foundations of the
House, together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, ac-
cept it from us, You are the Hearer, the
Knower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Lord, and make us submissive to You,
and from our descendants a community sub-
missive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor
of Repentance, the Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Lord, and raise up among them a
messenger, of themselves, who will recite to
them Your revelations, and teach them the
Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are
the Almighty, the Wise.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who would forsake the religion of Abra-
ham, except he who fools himself? We chose
him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will
be among the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He
said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the
Worlds.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Ja-
cob, “O my sons, Allah has chosen this reli-
gion for you, so do not die unless you have
submitted.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or were you witnesses when death ap-
proached Jacob, and he said to his sons,
“What will you worship after Me?” They said,
“We will worship your God, and the God of
your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac;
One God; and to Him we submit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was a community that has passed; for
them is what they have earned, and for you is
what you have earned; and you will not be
questioned about what they used to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, and
you will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion
of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an
idolater.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “We believe in Allah; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to
Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the prophets—from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we
surrender.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. But if
they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah will protect you against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allah’s coloring. And who gives better coloring than Allah? “And we are devoted to Him.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “Do you argue with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We
have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or
Christians? Say, “Do you know better, or Allah?”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has from Allah?
Allah is not unaware of what you do.</p>
<ol start="141">
<li>
<p>That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is
what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ignorant among the people will say, “What has turned them away from the direc-
tion of prayer they once followed?” Say, “To Allah belong the East and the West. He
guides whom He wills to a straight path.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus We made you a moderate community, that you may be witnesses to humanity,
and that the Messenger may be a witness to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We only established the direction of prayer, which you once followed, that We
may distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels. It
is indeed difficult, except for those whom Allah has guided. But Allah would never let
your faith go to waste.</p>
<ol start="144">
<li>
<p>We have seen your face turned towards the heaven. So We will turn you towards a di-
rection that will satisfy you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever
you may be, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Book know that it is the
Truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of what they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you were to bring to those who were given the Book every proof, they would
not follow your direction, nor are you to follow their direction, nor do they follow the direction of one another. And if you were to
follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you would be in that case
one of the wrongdoers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those to whom We have given the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children. But some of them conceal the truth
while they know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The truth is from your Lord, so do not be a skeptic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To every community is a direction towards which it turns. Therefore, race towards goodness. Wherever you may be, Allah will
bring you all together. Allah is capable of everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is the
truth from your Lord, and Allah is not heedless of what you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And wherever you come from, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you may be, turn your faces towards it.
So that the people may not have any argument against you—except those who do wrong among them. So do not fear them, but
fear Me, that I may complete My blessings upon you, and that you may be guided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as We sent to you a messenger from among you, who recites Our revelations to
you, and purifies you, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you
did not know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So remember Me, and I will remember you. And thank Me, and do not be ungrateful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek help through patience and prayers. Allah is with the steadfast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And do not say of those who are killed in the cause of Allah, “Dead.” Rather, they are
alive, but you do not perceive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will certainly test you with some fear and hunger, and some loss of possessions and
lives and crops. But give good news to the steadfast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, say, “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will return.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon these are blessings and mercy from
their Lord. These are the guided ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safa and Marwa are among the rites of Al-
lah. Whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the
House, or performs the Umrah, commits no
error by circulating between them. Whoever
volunteers good—Allah is Appreciative and
Cognizant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who suppress the proofs and the
guidance We have revealed, after We have
clarified them to humanity in the Scripture—
those—Allah curses them, and the cursers
curse them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except those who repent, and reform, and
proclaim. Those—I will accept their repent-
ance. I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the
Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But as for those who reject faith, and die
rejecting—those—upon them is the curse of
Allah, and of the angels, and of all humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will remain under it forever, and the
torment will not be lightened for them, and
they will not be reprieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your God is one God. There is no god but
He, the Benevolent, the Compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the creation of the heavens and the
earth; in the alternation of night and day; in
the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of
mankind; in the water that Allah sends down
from the sky, and revives the earth with it af-
ter it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of
creatures; in the changing of the winds, and
the clouds disposed between the sky and the
earth; are signs for people who understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet among the people are those who take
other than Allah as equals to Him. They love
them as the love of Allah. But those who be-
lieve have greater love for Allah. If only the
wrongdoers would realize, when they see the
torment; that all power is Allah’s, and that Al-
lah is severe in punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who were followed will then disown
those who followed them, and they will see
the retribution, and ties between them will be
severed.
Those who followed will say, “If only we
can have another chance, we will disown
them, as they disowned us.” Thus Allah will
show them their deeds, as regrets to them,
and they will not come out of the Fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O people! Eat of what is lawful and good
on earth, and do not follow the footsteps of
Satan. He is to you an open enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He commands you to do evil and vice, and
to say about Allah what you do not know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when it is said to them, “Follow what
Allah has revealed,” they say, “We will follow
what we found our ancestors following.”
Even if their ancestors understood nothing,
and were not guided?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parable of those who disbelieve is that
of someone who calls upon someone who
hears nothing except screaming and yelling.
Deaf, dumb, and blind—they do not under-
stand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Eat of the good things
We have provided for you, and give thanks to
Allah, if it is Him that you serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has forbidden you carrion, and blood,
and the flesh of swine, and what was dedi-
cated to other than Allah. But if anyone is
compelled, without desiring or exceeding, he
commits no sin. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who conceal what Allah revealed in
the Book, and exchange it for a small price—
those swallow nothing but fire into their bel-
lies. And Allah will not speak to them on the
Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them,
and they will have a painful punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is they who exchange guidance for error,
and forgiveness for punishment. But why do
they insist on the Fire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is because Allah has revealed the
Book in truth; and those who differ about the
Book are in deep discord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Righteousness does not consist of turning
your faces towards the East and the West. But
righteous is he who believes in Allah, and the
Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets. Who gives money, though
dear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the
needy, and the homeless, and the beggars,
and for the freeing of slaves; those who perform the prayers, and pay the obligatory
charity, and fulfill their promise when they promise, and patiently persevere in the face
of persecution, hardship, and in the time of conflict. These are the sincere; these are the
pious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Retaliation for the
murdered is ordained upon you: the free for
the free, the slave for the slave, the female for
the female. But if he is forgiven by his kin,
then grant any reasonable demand, and pay
with good will. This is a concession from
your Lord, and a mercy. But whoever com-
mits aggression after that, a painful torment
awaits him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is life for you in retaliation, O peo-
ple of understanding, so that you may refrain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is decreed for you: when death ap-
proaches one of you, and he leaves wealth, to
make a testament in favor of the parents and
the relatives, fairly and correctly—a duty
upon the righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But whoever changes it after he has heard
it, the guilt is upon those who change it. Allah
is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should someone suspect bias or injustice
on the part of a testator, and then reconciles
between them, he commits no sin. Allah is
Forgiving and Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed
for you, as it was prescribed for those before
you, that you may become righteous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a specified number of days. But who-
ever among you is sick, or on a journey, then
a number of other days. For those who are
able: a ransom of feeding a needy person. But
whoever volunteers goodness, it is better for
him. But to fast is best for you, if you only
knew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ramadan is the month in which the Quran
was revealed. Guidance for humanity, and
clear portents of guidance, and the Criterion. Whoever of you witnesses the month, shall
fast it. But whoever is sick, or on a journey,
then a number of other days. Allah desires
ease for you, and does not desire hardship for
you, that you may complete the number, and celebrate Allah for having guided you, so that you may be thankful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when My servants ask you about Me, I Am near; I answer the call of the caller when
he calls on Me. So let them answer Me, and have faith in Me, that they may be rightly
guided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permitted for you is intercourse with your
wives on the night of the fast. They are a gar-
ment for you, and you are a garment for
them. Allah knows that you used to betray
yourselves, but He turned to you and par-
doned you. So approach them now, and seek
what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and
drink until the white streak of dawn can be
distinguished from the black streak. Then
complete the fast until nightfall. But do not
approach them while you are in retreat at the
mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do
not come near them. Allah thus clarifies His
revelations to the people, that they may attain
piety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And do not consume one another’s wealth
by unjust means, nor offer it as bribes to the
officials in order to consume part of other
people’s wealth illicitly, while you know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They ask you about the crescents. Say,
“They are timetables for people, and for the
Hajj.” It is not virtuous that you approach
homes from their backs, but virtue is to be pi-
ous. So approach homes from their doors,
and observe Allah, that you may succeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And fight in the cause of Allah those who
fight you, but do not commit aggression; Al-
lah does not love the aggressors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And kill them wherever you overtake
them, and expel them from where they had
expelled you. Oppression is more serious
than murder. But do not fight them at the Sa-
cred Mosque, unless they fight you there. If
they fight you, then kill them. Such is the ret-
ribution of the disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if they cease, then Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And fight them until there is no oppres-
sion, and worship becomes devoted to Allah
alone. But if they cease, then let there be no
hostility except against the oppressors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sacred month for the sacred month;
and sacrilege calls for retaliation. Whoever
commits aggression against you, retaliate
against him in the same measure as he has
committed against you. And be conscious of
Allah, and know that Allah is with the right-
eous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And spend in the cause of Allah, and do
not throw yourselves with your own hands
into ruin, and be charitable. Allah loves the
charitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And carry out the Hajj and the Umrah for
Allah. But if you are prevented, then what-
ever is feasible of offerings. And do not shave
your heads until the offering has reached its
destination. Whoever of you is sick, or has an
injury of the head, then redemption of fast-
ing, or charity, or worship. When you are se-
cure: whoever continues the Umrah until the
Hajj, then whatever is feasible of offering. But
if he lacks the means, then fasting for three
days during the Hajj and seven when you
have returned, making ten in all. This is for
he whose household is not present at the Sa-
cred Mosque. And remain conscious of Allah, and know that Allah is stern in retribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hajj is during specific months. Who-
ever decides to perform the Hajj—there shall
be no sexual relations, nor misconduct, nor
quarrelling during the Hajj. And whatever
good you do, Allah knows it. And take provi-
sions, but the best provision is righteousness.
And be mindful of Me, O people of under-
standing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You commit no error by seeking bounty
from your Lord. When you disperse from Ar-
afat, remember Allah at the Sacred Land-
mark. And remember Him as He has guided
you. Although, before that, you were of those
astray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then disperse from where the people dis-
perse, and ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is
Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have completed your rites, re-
member Allah as you remember your par-
ents, or even more. Among the people is he
who says, “Our Lord, give us in this world,”
yet he has no share in the Hereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And among them is he who says, “Our
Lord, give us goodness in this world, and
goodness in the Hereafter, and protect us
from the torment of the Fire.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These will have a share of what they have
earned. Allah is swift in reckoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And remember Allah during the desig-
nated days. But whoever hurries on in two
days commits no wrong, and whoever stays
on commits no wrong—provided he main-
tains righteousness. And obey Allah, and
know that to Him you will be gathered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the people is he whose speech
about the worldly life impresses you, and he
calls Allah to witness what is in his heart,
while he is the most hostile of adversaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he gains power, he strives to spread
corruption on earth, destroying properties
and lives. Allah does not like corruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when he is told, “Beware of Allah,”
his pride leads him to more sin. Hell is
enough for him—a dreadful abode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And among the people is he who sells
himself seeking Allah’s approval. Allah is
kind towards the servants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! Enter into submission,
wholeheartedly, and do not follow the foot-
steps of Satan; he is to you an outright enemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if you slip after the proofs have come
to you, know that Allah is Powerful and Wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they waiting for Allah Himself to
come to them in the shadows of the clouds,
together with the angels, and thus the matter
is settled? All things are returned to Allah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We have given them. Whoever alters the blessing of Allah after it has come to
him—Allah is severe in retribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who
believe. But the righteous will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides to
whomever He wills without measure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Humanity used to be one community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Then Allah sent the prophets, the Scripture and the truth, bringing good news and giving warnings to judge between people regarding their differences.</li>
</ul>
<p>But none differed over it except those who were given it—after the proofs had
come to them—out of mutual envy between
them.</p>
<p>Then Allah guided those who believed to the truth they had disputed, in accordance
with His will. Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path.</p>
<ol start="214">
<li>
<p>Or do you expect to enter Paradise before the example of those who came before you had reached you? Adversity and hardship
had afflicted them, and they were so shaken up, that the Messenger and those who believed with him said, “When is Allah’s victory?” Indeed, Allah’s victory is near.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They ask you what they should give. Say, “Whatever charity you give is for the parents,
and the relatives, and the orphans, and the
poor, and the wayfarer. Whatever good you
do, Allah is aware of it.</p>
