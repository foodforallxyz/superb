<p>Scripture was revealed to you, so let there be no anxiety in your heart because of it. You
are to warn with it—and a reminder for the believers.



<sup style="color: dimgray">
    3

  Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, and do not follow other masters beside
Him. Little you recollect.</p>

  How many towns have We destroyed?</p>
<p>Our might came upon them by night, or while they were napping.



<sup style="color: dimgray">
    5

  When Our might came upon them, their only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”
6. We will question those to whom messengers were sent, and We will question the messengers.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>We will narrate to them with knowledge, for We were never absent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scales on that Day will be just. Those whose weights are heavy—it is they who are
the successful.



<sup style="color: dimgray">
    9
</sup>
  But as for those whose weights are light—it is they who have lost their souls, because they used to mistreat Our revelations.



<sup style="color: dimgray">

  We have established you firmly on earth, and made for you in it livelihood—but rarely do you give thanks.

  We created you, then We shaped you, then We said to the angels, “Bow down before Adam;” so they bowed down, except for Satan; he was not of those who bowed down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “What prevented you from bowing down when I have commanded you?” He said, “I am better than he; You created me from fire, and You created him from mud.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of the lowly!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “Give me respite, until the Day they are resurrected.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “You are of those given respite.”
said, “Because you have lured me, I will waylay them on Your straight path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I will come at them from before them, and from behind them, and from their right, and from their left; and you will not find most of them appreciative.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “Get out of it, despised and vanquished. Whoever among them follows you—I will fill up Hell with you all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your wife, and eat whatever you wish; but do not approach this tree, lest you become
sinners.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to them their nakedness, which was invisible to
them. He said, “Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree, lest you become angels, or
become immortals.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he swore to them, “I am a sincere advisor to you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So he lured them with deceit. And when they tasted the tree, their nakedness became
evident to them, and they began covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden.
And their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from this tree, and say to you that
Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They said, “Our Lord, we have done wrong to ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have
mercy on us, we will be among the losers.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “Fall, some of you enemies to one another. On earth you will have residence
and livelihood for a while.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said, “In it you will live, and in it you will die, and from it you will be brought out.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O children of Adam! We have provided you with clothing to cover your bodies, and
for luxury. But the clothing of piety—that is best. These are some of Allah’s revelations, so
that they may take heed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan seduce you, as he drove your parents out of the
Garden, stripping them of their garments, to
show them their nakedness. He sees you, him
and his clan, from where you cannot see
them. We have made the devils friends of
those who do not believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when they commit an indecency, they
say, “We found our parents doing this, and
Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “Al-
lah does not command indecencies. Are you
attributing to Allah what you do not know?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to
stand devoted at every place of worship. So
call upon Him, and dedicate your faith to</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Him alone. Just as He originated you, so you will return.”
30. Some He has guided, and some have de-
served misguidance. They have adopted the
devils for patrons rather than Allah, and they
assume that they are guided.
31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at
every place of worship, and eat and drink, but
do not be excessive. He does not love the ex-
cessive.
32. Say, “Who forbade Allah’s finery which He
has produced for His servants, and the de-
lights of livelihood?” Say, “They are for those
who believe, in this present world, but exclu-
sively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” We
thus detail the revelations for people who
know.
33. Say, “My Lord has forbidden immorali-
ties—both open and secret—and sin, and un-
justified aggression, and that you associate
with Allah anything for which He revealed no
sanction, and that you say about Allah what
you do not know.”
34. For every nation is an appointed time.
When their time has come, they cannot delay
it by one hour, nor can they advance it.
35. O Children of Adam! When messengers
from among you come to you, relating to you
My revelations—whoever practices piety and
reforms—upon them shall be no fear, nor
shall they grieve.
36. But as for those who reject Our revelations,
and are too proud to accept them—these are
the inmates of the Fire, where they will re-
main forever.
37. Who does greater wrong than he who in-
vents lies about Allah, or denies His revela-
tions? These—their share of the decree will
reach them. Until, when Our envoys come to
them, to take their souls away, they will say,
“Where are they whom you used to pray to
besides Allah?” They will say, “They have
abandoned us,” and they will testify against
themselves that they were faithless.
38. He will say, “Join the crowds of jinn and
humans who have gone into the Fire before</p>
<p>you.” They have not entered it, but they are
hoping.
47. And when their eyes are directed towards
the inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our
Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing
people.”
48. And the dwellers of the Elevations will call
to men they recognize by their features, say-
ing, “Your hoardings did not avail you, nor
did your arrogance.”
49. “Are these the ones you swore Allah will
not touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden;
you have nothing to fear, and you will not
grieve.”
50. The inmates of the Fire will call on the in-
habitants of the Garden, “Pour some water
over us, or some of what Allah has provided
for you.” They will say, “Allah has forbidden
them for the disbelievers.”
51. Those who took their religion lightly, and
in jest, and whom the worldly life deceived.
Today We will ignore them, as they ignored
the meeting on this Day of theirs, and they
used to deny Our revelations.
52. We have given them a Scripture, which We
detailed with knowledge—guidance and
mercy for people who believe.
53. Are they waiting for anything but its fulfill-
ment? The Day its fulfillment comes true,
those who disregarded it before will say, “The
messengers of our Lord did come with the
truth. Have we any intercessors to intercede
for us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave
differently from the way we behaved before?”
They ruined their souls, and what they used
to invent has failed them.
54. Your Lord is Allah; He who created the
heavens and the earth in six days, then estab-
lished Himself on the Throne. The night
overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently;
and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are
subservient by His command. His is the cre-
ation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al-
lah, Lord of all beings.
55. Call upon your Lord humbly and privately.
He does not love the aggressors.
you.” Every time a crowd enters, it will curse
its sister-crowd. Until, when they are all in it,
the last of them will say to the first of them,
“Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us,
so inflict on them a double punishment in the
Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a double,
but you do not know.”
39. The first of them will say to the last of them,
“You have no advantage over us, so taste the
torment for what you used to earn.”
40. Those who reject Our revelations and are
too arrogant to uphold them—the doors of
Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will
they enter Paradise, until the camel passes
through the eye of the needle. Thus We repay
the guilty.
41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them
are sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong-
doers.
42. As for those who believe and do righteous
works—We never burden any soul beyond its
capacity—these are the inhabitants of the
Garden; abiding therein eternally.
43. We will remove whatever rancor is in their
hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. And
they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has
guided us to this. Had Allah not guided us,
we would never be guided. The messengers of
our Lord did come with the truth.” And it will
be proclaimed to them, “This is the Garden
you are made to inherit, on account of what
you used to do.”
44. And the inhabitants of the Garden will call
out to the inmates of the Fire, “We found
what our Lord promised us to be true; did
you find what your Lord promised you to be
true?” They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a
caller will announce in their midst, “The
curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.”
45. “Those who hinder from the path of Allah,
and seek to distort it, and who deny the Here-
after.”
46. And between them is a partition, and on
the Elevations are men who recognize every-
one by their features. They will call to the in-
habitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon
557. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
56. And do not corrupt on earth after its refor-
mation, and pray to Him with fear and hope.
Allah’s mercy is close to the doers of good.
57. It is He who sends the wind ahead of His
mercy. Then, when they have gathered up
heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land,
where We make water come down, and with
it We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We
bring out the dead—perhaps you will reflect.
58. As for the good land, it yields its produce
by the leave of its Lord. But as for the bad, it
produces nothing but hardship and misery.
Thus We explain the revelations in various
ways for people who are thankful.
59. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god
other than Him. I fear for you the punish-
ment of a tremendous Day.”
60. The dignitaries among his people said,
“We see that you are in obvious error.”
61. He said, “O my people, I am not in error,
but I am a messenger from the Lord of the
Worlds.”
62. “I deliver to you the messages of my Lord,
and I advise you, and I know from Allah what
you do not know.”
63. “Do you wonder that a reminder has come
to you from your Lord, through a man from
among you, to warn you, and to lead you to
righteousness, so that you may attain
mercy?”
64. But they called him a liar. So We saved him
and those with him in the Ark, and We
drowned those who rejected Our revelations.
They were blind people.
65. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god
other than Him. Will you not take heed?”
66. The elite of his people who disbelieved
said, “We see foolishness in you, and we think
that you are a liar.”
67. He said, “O my people! There is no foolish-
ness in me, but I am a messenger from the
Lord of the Worlds.
68. “I
convey to you the messages of my Lord,
and I am a trustworthy adviser to you.”
69. “Are you surprised that a reminder has
come to you from your Lord, through a man
from among you, to warn you? Remember
how He made you successors after the people
of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature.
And remember Allah’s blessings, so that you
may prosper.”
70. They said, “Did you come to us to make us
worship Allah alone, and abandon what our
ancestors used to worship? Then bring us
what you threaten us with, if you are truth-
ful.”
71. He said, “Condemnation and wrath have
befallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing
with me over names, which you and your an-
cestors invented, for which Allah sent down
no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with
you.”
72. So We saved him and those with him, by
mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of
those who rejected Our revelations and were
not believers.
73. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He
said, “O my people! Worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. Clarification has
come to you from your Lord. This she-camel
of Allah is a sign for you. So leave her to graze
on Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a
painful penalty seizes you.”
74. “And remember how He made you succes-
sors after Aad, and settled you in the land.
You make for yourselves mansions on its
plains, and carve out dwellings in the moun-
tains. So remember Allah’s benefits, and do
not roam the earth corruptingly.”
75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant,
said to the common people who had believed,
“Do you know that Saleh is sent from his
Lord?” They said, “We are believers in what
he was sent with.”
76. Those who were arrogant said, “We reject
what you believe in.”
77. So they hamstrung the she-camel, and de-
fied the command of their Lord, and said, “O
567. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us
with, if you are one of the messengers.”
78. Whereupon the quake overtook them, and
they became lifeless bodies in their homes.
79. Then he turned away from them, and said,
“O my people, I have delivered to you the
message of my Lord, and I have advised you,
but you do not like those who give advice.”
80. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do
you commit lewdness no people anywhere
have ever committed before you?”
81. “You lust after men rather than women.
You are an excessive people.”
82. And his people&rsquo;s only answer was to say,
“Expel them from your town; they are purist
people.”
83. But We saved him and his family, except
for his wife; she was of those who lagged be-
hind.
84. And We rained down on them a rain; note
the consequences for the sinners.
85. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He
said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. A clear proof has
come to you from your Lord. Give full meas-
ure and weight, and do not cheat people out
of their rights, and do not corrupt the land
once it has been set right. This is better for
you, if you are believers.”
86. “And do not lurk on every path, making
threats and turning away from the path of Al-
lah those who believe in Him, seeking to dis-
tort it. And remember how you were few, and
how He made you numerous. So note the
consequences for the corrupters.”
87. “Since some of you believed in what I was
sent with, and some did not believe, be pa-
tient until Allah judges between us; for He is
the Best of Judges.”
88. The arrogant elite among his people said,
“O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town,
along with those who believe with you, unless
you return to our religion.” He said, “Even if
we are unwilling?”
89. “We would be fabricating falsehood
against Allah, if we were to return to your re-
ligion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is
not for us to return to it, unless Allah, our
Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in
knowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our
Lord, decide between us and our people in
truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”
90. The elite of his people who disbelieved
said, “If you follow Shuaib, you will be los-
ers.”
91. Thereupon, the quake struck them; and
they became lifeless bodies in their homes.
92. Those who rejected Shuaib—as if they
never prospered therein. Those who rejected
Shuaib—it was they who were the losers.
93. So he turned away from them, and said, “O
my people, I have delivered to you the mes-
sages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so
why should I grieve over a disbelieving peo-
ple?”
94. We did not send any prophet to any town
but We afflicted its people with misery and
adversity, so that they may humble them-
selves.
95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of
hardship. Until they increased in number,
and said, “Adversity and prosperity has
touched our ancestors.” Then We seized
them suddenly, while they were unaware.
96. Had the people of the towns believed and
turned righteous, We would have opened for
them the blessings of the heaven and the
earth; but they rejected the truth, so We
seized them by what they were doing.
97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that
Our might will not come upon them by night,
while they sleep?
98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that
Our might will not come upon them by day,
while they play?
99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None
feel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing
people.
577. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the
land after its inhabitants, that if We willed,
We could strike them for their sins? And seal
up their hearts, so that they would not hear?
101. These towns—We narrate to you some of
their tales. Their messengers came to them
with the clear signs, but they would not be-
lieve in what they had rejected previously.
Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.
102. We found most of them untrue to their
covenants; We found most of them corrupt.
103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our
miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment,
but they denounced them. So consider the
end of the evildoers.
104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger
from the Lord of the Worlds.”
105. “It is only proper that I should not say
about Allah anything other than the truth. I
have come to you with clear evidence from
your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go
with me.”
106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then
present it, if you are truthful.”
107. So he threw his staff, and it was an appar-
ent serpent.
108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was
white to the onlookers.
109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people
said, “This is really a skilled magician.”
110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so
what do you recommend?”
111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother,
and send heralds to the cities.”
112. “And let them bring you every skillful ma-
gician.”
113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said,
“Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the
victors.”
114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my
favorites.”
115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or
we are the ones to throw.”
He said, “You throw!” And when they
threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people,
and intimidated them, and produced a
mighty magic.
117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your
staff.” And at once, it swallowed what they
were faking.
118. So the truth came to pass, and what they
were producing came to nothing.
119. There they were defeated, and utterly re-
duced.
116.
120. And
the magicians fell to their knees.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord
of the Worlds.”
121.
122. “The
Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
said, “Did you believe in Him be-
fore I have given you permission? This is
surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city,
in order to expel its people from it. You will
surely know.”
124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet on
opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”
125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will
return.”
126. “You are taking vengeance on us only be-
cause we have believed in the signs of our
Lord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord!
Pour out patience upon us, and receive our
souls in submission.”
127. The chiefs of Pharaoh&rsquo;s people said, “Will
you let Moses and his people cause trouble in
the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He
said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their
women. We have absolute power over them.”
128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Al-
lah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al-
lah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever
He wills of His servants, and the future be-
longs to the righteous.”
129. They said, “We were persecuted before
you came to us, and after you came to us.” He
said, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your
enemy, and make you successors in the land;
then He will see how you behave.”
123. Pharaoh
587. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh
with barren years, and with shortage of crops,
that they may take heed.
131. When something good came their way,
they said, “This is ours.” And when some-
thing bad happened to them, they ascribed
the evil omen to Moses and those with him.
In fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of
them do not know.
132. And they said, “No matter what sign you
bring us, to bewitch us with, we will not be-
lieve in you.”
133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and
the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and
blood—all explicit signs—but they were too
arrogant. They were a sinful people.
134. Whenever a plague befell them, they
would say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for
us, according to the covenant He made with
you. If you lift the plague from us, we will be-
lieve in you, and let the Children of Israel go
with you.”
135. But when We lifted the plague from them,
for a term they were to fulfill, they broke their
promise.
136. So We took vengeance on them, and
drowned them in the sea—because they re-
jected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.
137. And We made the oppressed people in-
herit the eastern and western parts of the
land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair
promise of your Lord to the Children of Israel
was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And
We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people
had built, and what they had harvested.
138. And We delivered the Children of Israel
across the sea. And when they came upon a
people who were devoted to some statues of
theirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god,
as they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an
ignorant people.”
139. “What these people are concerned with is
perdition, and their deeds are based on false-
hoods.”
140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other
than Allah, when He has favored you over all
other people?”
141. Remember how We saved you from Phar-
aoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst
of sufferings—killing your sons and sparing
your women. In that was a tremendous trial
from your Lord.
142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights,
and completed them with ten; and thus the
time appointed by his Lord was forty nights.
And Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take
my place among my people, and be upright,
and do not follow the way of the mischief-
makers.”
143. And when Moses came to Our appoint-
ment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said,
“My Lord, allow me to look and see You.” He
said, “You will not see Me, but look at the
mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see
Me.” But when his Lord manifested Himself
to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and
Moses fell down unconscious. Then, when he
recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent
to you, and I am the first of the believers.”
144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over
all people for My messages and for My
Words. So take what I have given you, and be
one of the thankful.”
145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets
all kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex-
planation of all things. “Hold fast to them,
and exhort your people to adopt the best of
them. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”
146. I will turn away from My revelations those
who behave proudly on earth without justifi-
cation. Even if they see every sign, they will
not believe in it; and if they see the path of
rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and
if they see the path of error, they will adopt it
for a path. That is because they denied Our
revelations, and paid no attention to them.
147. Those who deny Our revelations and the
meeting of the Hereafter—their deeds will
come to nothing. Will they be repaid except
according to what they used to do?
130.
597. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
it upon whomever I will, but My mercy en-
compasses all things. I will specify it for those
who act righteously and practice regular
charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”
157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Un-
lettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned
in the Torah and the Gospel in their posses-
sion. He directs them to righteousness, and
deters them from evil, and allows for them all
good things, and prohibits for them wicked-
ness, and unloads the burdens and the shack-
les that are upon them. Those who believe in
him, and respect him, and support him, and
follow the light that came down with him—
these are the successful.
158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Al-
lah to you all—He to whom belongs the king-
dom of the heavens and the earth. There is no
god but He. He gives life and causes death.”
So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the
Unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah
and His words. And follow him, that you may
be guided.
159. Among the people of Moses is a commu-
nity that guides by truth, and thereby does
justice.
160. We divided them into twelve tribal com-
munities. And We inspired Moses, when his
people asked him for something to drink:
“Strike the rock with your staff.” Whereupon
twelve springs gushed from it. Each group
recognized its drinking-place. And We
shaded them with clouds, and We sent down
upon them manna and quails: “Eat of the
good things We have provided for you.” They
did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong
their own selves.
161. And it was said to them, “Settle this town,
and eat therein whatever you wish, and speak
modestly, and enter the gate in humility—
We will forgive your sins, and will promote
the righteous.”
162. But the wicked among them substituted
other words for the words given to them; so
We sent down upon them a plague from the
sky, because of their wrongdoing.
In his absence, the people of Moses
adopted a calf made from their ornaments—
a body which lowed. Did they not see that it
could not speak to them, nor guide them in
any way? They took it for worship. They were
in the wrong.
149. Then, when they regretted, and realized
that they had erred, they said, “Unless our
Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives
us, we will be among the losers.”
150. And when Moses returned to his people,
angry and disappointed, he said, “What an
awful thing you did in my absence. Did you
forsake the commandments of your Lord so
hastily?” And he threw down the tablets; and
he took hold of his brother’s head, dragging
him towards himself. He said, “Son of my
mother, the people have overpowered me,
and were about to kill me; so do not allow the
enemies to gloat over me, and do not count
me among the unjust people.”
151. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and my
brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for
you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”
152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred
wrath from their Lord, and humiliation in
this life. We thus requite the innovators.
153. As for those who commit sins, and then
repent afterwards and believe—your Lord,
thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took
up the tablets. In their transcript is guidance
and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.
155. And Moses chose from his people seventy
men for Our appointment. When the tremor
shook them, he said, “My Lord, had You
willed, You could have destroyed them be-
fore, and me too. Will you destroy us for what
the fools among us have done? This is but
Your test—with it You misguide whomever
You will, and guide whomever You will. You
are our Protector, so forgive us, and have
mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”
156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this
world, and in the Hereafter. We have turned
to You.” He said, “My punishment—I inflict
148.
607. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
what We have given you, and remember what
it contains, so that you may be saved.”
172. And when Your Lord summoned the de-
scendants of Adam, and made them testify
about themselves. “Am I not your Lord?”
They said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot
say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un-
aware of this.”
173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced
idolatry before; and we are their descendants
who came after them; will you destroy us for
what the falsifiers did?”
174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that
they may return.
175. And relate to them the story of him to
whom We delivered Our signs, but he de-
tached himself from them, so Satan went af-
ter him, and he became one of the perverts.
176. Had We willed, We could have elevated
him through them; but he clung to the
ground, and followed his desires. His meta-
phor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants;
and if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the
metaphor of the people who deny Our signs.
So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.
177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re-
ject Our signs and wrong themselves.
178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one.
And whomever He sends astray—these are
the losers.
179. We have destined for Hell multitudes of
jinn and humans. They have hearts with
which they do not understand. They have
eyes with which they do not see. They have
ears with which they do not hear. These are
like cattle. In fact, they are further astray.
These are the heedless.
180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful
Names, so call Him by them, and disregard
those who blaspheme His names. They will
be repaid for what they used to do.
181. Among those We created is a commu-
nity—they guide by truth, and do justice
thereby.
163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when
they violated the Sabbath. When they ob-
served the Sabbath, their fish would come to
them abundantly. But when they violated the
Sabbath, their fish would not come to them.
Thus We tried them because they disobeyed.
164. And when a group of them said, “Why do
you counsel a people whom Allah will anni-
hilate, or punish with a severe punishment?”
They said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so
that they may become righteous.”
165. Then, when they neglected what they were
reminded of, We saved those who prohibited
evil, and We seized those who did wrong with
a terrible punishment, because of their sinful-
ness.
166. Then, when they rebelled against the com-
mands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des-
picable apes.”
167. Your Lord has announced that, He would
send against them, until the Day of Resurrec-
tion, those who would inflict terrible suffer-
ing upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribu-
tion, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.
168. And We scattered them into communities
on earth. Some of them righteous, and some
of them short of that. And We tested them
with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they
may return.
169. They were succeeded by generations who
inherited the Scripture and chose the materi-
als of this world, saying, “We will be for-
given.” And should similar materials come
their way, they would again seize them. Did
they not make a covenant to uphold the
Scripture, and to not say about Allah except
the truth? Did they not study its contents?
But the Home of the Hereafter is better for
the cautious; will you not understand?
170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and
practice prayer—We will not waste the re-
ward of the reformers.
171. And when We suspended the mountain
over them, as if it was an umbrella, and they
thought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to</p>

but most people do not know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say, “I have no control over any benefit or
harm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I
known the future, I would have acquired
much good, and no harm would have
touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald
of good news to a people who believe.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is He who created you from a single per-
son, and made from it its mate, that he may
find comfort with her. Then, when he has
covered her, she conceives a light load, and
she carries it around.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But when she has grown heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You
give us a good child, we will be among the thankful.”</p>
<ol start="190">
<li>
<p>But when He has given them a good child, they attribute partners to Him in what He has
given them. Allah is exalted above what they associate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they idolize those who create nothing, and are themselves created?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And can neither help them, nor help their own selves?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you, whether you invite them, or remain silent.</p>
<ol start="194">
<li>
<p>Those you call upon besides Allah are servants like you. So call upon them, and let
them answer you, if you are truthful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they have feet with which they walk?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Or do they have hands with which they strike? Or do they have eyes with which they
see?</p>
<p>Or do they have ears with which they hear?</p>
<p>Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot against me, and do not wait.”</p>
<ol start="196">
<li>
<p>“My Master is Allah, He Who sent down the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those you call upon besides Him cannot help you, nor can they help themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if you call them to guidance, they will not hear. And you see them looking at you, yet they do not see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be tolerant, and command decency, and avoid the ignorant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And when a suggestion from Satan assails you, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing and Knowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who are righteous—when an impulse from Satan strikes them, they remind themselves, and immediately see clearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But their brethren lead them relentlessly into error, and they never stop short.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do not produce a miracle for them, they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.” Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord.” These are insights from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people who believe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and pay attention, so that you may experience mercy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the morning and the evening, and do not be of the neglectful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who are in the presence of your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>you water from the sky, to cleanse you with
it, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to
fortify your hearts, and to strengthen your
foothold.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with you, so support those who believe. I will cast
terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve.</li>
</ol>
<p>So strike above the necks, and strike off every fingertip of theirs.”</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>
<p>That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His
Messenger—Allah is severe in retribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers there is the suffering of the Fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who believe! When you meet those who disbelieve on the march, never turn your backs on them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>

</sup>
Anyone who turns his back on them on that Day, except while maneuvering for battle, or to join another group, has incurred
wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell!</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>
<p>It was not you who killed them, but it was Allah who killed them. And it was not you
who launched when you launched, but it was Allah who launched. That He may bestow
upon the believers an excellent reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such is the case. Allah will undermine the strategy of the disbelievers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if you desist, it would be best for
you. And if you return, We will return; and
your troops, however numerous, will not
benefit you. Allah is with the believers.</p>

<li>And be not like those who say, “We hear,” when they do not hear.</li>
<li>The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf and dumb—those who do not reason.</li>
<li>Had Allah recognized any good in them, He would have made them hear; and had He
recite His praises, and to Him they bow down.</li>
