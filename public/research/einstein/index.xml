      <description>The idea of the ether comes from=
 the theory of action at a distance the properties of light which have led to the undulatory theory  Outside of physics, we know nothing of action at a distance*.
 *Superphysics note= This is false because most actions in metaphysics are actions at a distance.
 It seems to us that there are only actions of immediate contact=
 collision push and pull heating or inducing combustion by means of a flame, etc.</description>
