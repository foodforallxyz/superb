article, and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act.</li>

the Union or a State, is appointed under this Constitution to hold such a post may, if the President or the
Governor 4 ***, as the case may be, deems it necessary in order to secure the services of a person having

required to vacate that post.</li>

(3) If, in respect of any such person as aforesaid, a question arises whether it is reasonably practicable
to hold such inquiry as is referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of the authority empowered to
dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank shall be final.]</li>
<li>All-India services.—(1) Notwithstanding anything in 1 [Chapter VI of Part VI or Part XI], if the
Council of States has declared by resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present
and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest so to do, Parliament may by law provide
for the creation of one or more all India services 2 [(including an all-India judicial service)] common to the
