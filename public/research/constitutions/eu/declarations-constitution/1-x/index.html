1.
Declaration on Article I-6
The Conference notes that Article I-6 reflects existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
2.
Declaration on Article I-9(2)
The Conference agrees that the Union&rsquo;s accession to the European Convention on the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be arranged in such a way as to preserve the
specific features of Union law. In this connection, the Conference notes the existence of a regular
dialogue between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human
Rights; such dialogue could be reinforced when the Union accedes to that Convention.
3.
Declaration on Articles I-22, I-27 and I-28
In choosing the persons called upon to hold the offices of President of the European Council,
President of the Commission and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, due account is to be taken of the
need to respect the geographical and demographic diversity of the Union and its Member States.
4.
Declaration on Article I-24(7) concerning the European Council decision on the
exercise of the Presidency of the Council
The Conference declares that the Council should begin preparing the European decision establishing
the measures for applying the European decision of the European Council on the exercise of the

<li>Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
The Conference takes note of the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and
updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, as set out below.
EXPLANATIONS RELATING TO THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
These explanations were originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention
which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They have been updated
under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, in the light of the drafting
adjustments made to the text of the Charter by that Convention (notably to Articles 51 and 52 ( 1 ))
and of further developments of Union law. Although they do not as such have the status of law, they
are a valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter.
PREAMBLE
The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful
future based on common values.
Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values
of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the
rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the
Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while
respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national
identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional
and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free
movement of persons, services, goods and capital, and the freedom of establishment.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes
in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more
visible in a Charter.
This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and the principle of
subsidiarity, the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international
obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the
Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the
European Court of Human Rights. In this context the Charter will be interpreted by the courts of the
Union and the Member States with due regard to the explanations prepared under the authority of
the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of

the Praesidium of the European Convention.
Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons, to the
human community and to future generations.
The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out hereafter.
TITLE I
DIGNITY
Article 1 ( 1 )
Human dignity
Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.
Explanation
The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental
rights. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined human dignity in its preamble: ‘Whereas
recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.’ In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98
Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR 7079, at grounds 70 to 77, the Court of Justice confirmed
that a fundamental right to human dignity is part of Union law.
It results that none of the rights laid down in this Charter may be used to harm the dignity of another person, and that
the dignity of the human person is part of the substance of the rights laid down in this Charter. It must therefore be
respected, even where a right is restricted.

(c) the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain;
(d) the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
Explanation</li>
<li>In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98 Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR
7079, at grounds 70, 78 to 80, the Court of Justice confirmed that a fundamental right to human integrity is part
of Union law and encompasses, in the context of medicine and biology, the free and informed consent of the donor
and recipient.</li>
<li>The principles of Article 3 of the Charter ( 1 ) are already included in the Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine, adopted by the Council of Europe (ETS 164 and additional protocol ETS 168). The Charter does not
set out to depart from those principles, and therefore prohibits only reproductive cloning. It neither authorises nor
prohibits other forms of cloning. Thus it does not in any way prevent the legislature from prohibiting other forms
of cloning.</li>
<li>The reference to eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons, relates to possible
situations in which selection programmes are organised and implemented, involving campaigns for sterilisation,
forced pregnancy, compulsory ethnic marriage among others, all acts deemed to be international crimes in the
Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 (see its Article 7(1)(g)).
Article 4 ( 2 )
Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Explanation
The right in Article 4 ( 2 ) is the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the ECHR, which has the same wording: ‘No one shall be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. By virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 3 ),
it therefore has the same meaning and the same scope as the ECHR Article.

<li>No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.</li>
<li>Trafficking in human beings is prohibited.
Explanation</li>
<li></li>
<li>Paragraph 3 stems directly from human dignity and takes account of recent developments in organised crime, such
as the organisation of lucrative illegal immigration or sexual exploitation networks. The Annex to the Europol
Convention contains the following definition which refers to trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation:
‘traffic in human beings: means subjection of a person to the real and illegal sway of other persons by using
violence or menaces or by abuse of authority or intrigue with a view to the exploitation of prostitution, forms of
sexual exploitation and assault of minors or trade in abandoned children’. Chapter VI of the Convention
implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has been integrated into the Union&rsquo;s acquis, in which the United
Kingdom and Ireland participate, contains the following wording in Article 27(1) which refers to illegal
immigration networks: ‘The Contracting Parties undertake to impose appropriate penalties on any person who, for
financial gain, assists or tries to assist an alien to enter or reside within the territory of one of the Contracting
Parties in breach of that Contracting Party&rsquo;s laws on the entry and residence of aliens.’ On 19 July 2002, the
Council adopted a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings (OJ L 203/1) whose Article 1
defines in detail the offences concerning trafficking in human beings for the purposes of labour exploitation or
sexual exploitation, which the Member States must make punishable by virtue of that framework decision.

TITLE II
FREEDOMS
Article 6 ( 1 )
Right to liberty and security
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
Explanation
The rights in Article 6 ( 1 ) are the rights guaranteed by Article 5 of the ECHR, and in accordance with Article 52(3) of
the Charter ( 2 ), they have the same meaning and scope. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be
imposed on them may not exceed those permitted by the ECHR, in the wording of Article 5:
‘1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the
following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;
(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to
secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal
authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered
necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;
(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for
the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;
(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of
unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;
(f)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of
a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.</li>
<li>Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his
arrest and of any charge against him.</li>
<li>Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought
promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial
within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.

Final act</li>
<li>Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the
lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.</li>
<li>Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall
have an enforceable right to compensation.’
The rights enshrined in Article 6 ( 1 ) must be respected particularly when the European Parliament
and the Council adopt laws and framework laws in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal
matters, on the basis of Articles III-270, III-271 and III-273 of the Constitution, notably to define
common minimum provisions as regards the categorisation of offences and punishments and certain
aspects of procedural law.
Article 7 ( 2 )
Respect for private and family life
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.
Explanation
The rights guaranteed in Article 7 ( 2 ) correspond to those guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR. To take account of
developments in technology the word ‘correspondence’ has been replaced by ‘communications’.
In accordance with Article 52(3) ( 3 ), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those of the corresponding
article of the ECHR. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be imposed on this right are the same as
those allowed by Article 8 of the ECHR:
‘1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.</li>
<li>There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance
with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,
or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’

Article 8 ( 1 )
Protection of personal data</li>
<li></li>
<li>Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the
person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right includes
freedom to change religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in
public or in private, to manifest religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.</li>
<li>The right to conscientious objection is recognised, in accordance with the national laws
governing the exercise of this right.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in paragraph 1 corresponds to the right guaranteed in Article 9 of the ECHR and, in accordance
with Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 2 ), has the same meaning and scope. Limitations must therefore respect Article 9(2) of
the Convention, which reads as follows: ‘Freedom to manifest one&rsquo;s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the
protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’
The right guaranteed in paragraph 2 corresponds to national constitutional traditions and to the development of
national legislation on this issue.
Article 11 ( 3 )
Freedom of expression and information</li>
<li>Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority
and regardless of frontiers.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Article 11 ( 3 ) corresponds to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive
and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article
shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.

<li>Paragraph 2 of this Article spells out the consequences of paragraph 1 regarding freedom of the media. It is based
in particular on Court of Justice case-law regarding television, particularly in case C-288/89 (judgment of 25 July 1991,
Stichting Collectieve Antennevoorziening Gouda and others [1991] ECR I-4007), and on the Protocol on the system of
public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the EC Treaty and now to the Constitution, and on Council
Directive 89/552/EC (particularly its seventeenth recital).
Article 12 ( 2 )
Freedom of assembly and of association</li>
<li>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all
levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of everyone to
form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests.</li>
<li>Political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the
Union.
Explanation</li>
<li>Paragraph 1 of this Article corresponds to Article 11 of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the
right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.</li>
<li>No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder
or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This
article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the
armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.’

Final act
The meaning of the provisions of paragraph 1 is the same as that of the ECHR, but their scope is wider since they apply
at all levels including European level. In accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 1 ), limitations on that right may
not exceed those considered legitimate by virtue of Article 11(2) of the ECHR.</li>

<li>Everyone has the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training.</li>
<li>This right includes the possibility to receive free compulsory education.</li>
<li>The freedom to found educational establishments with due respect for democratic principles and

religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions shall be respected, in accordance with the
national laws governing the exercise of such freedom and right.

<li>Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of
establishment and to provide services in any Member State.</li>
<li>Nationals of third countries who are authorised to work in the territories of the Member States
are entitled to working conditions equivalent to those of citizens of the Union.
Explanation
Freedom to choose an occupation, as enshrined in Article 15(1) ( 2 ), is recognised in Court of Justice case-law (see inter
alia judgment of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraphs 12 to 14 of the grounds; judgment of
13 December 1979, Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 8 October 1986, Case 234/85 Keller [1986]
ECR 2897, paragraph 8 of the grounds).
This paragraph also draws upon Article 1(2) of the European Social Charter, which was signed on 18 October 1961 and
has been ratified by all the Member States, and on point 4 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights
of Workers of 9 December 1989. The expression ‘working conditions’ is to be understood in the sense of Article III-213
of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 deals with the three freedoms guaranteed by Articles I-4 and III-133, III-137 and III-144 of the
Constitution, namely freedom of movement for workers, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
Paragraph 3 has been based on TEC Article 137(3), fourth indent, now replaced by Article III-210(1)(g) of the
Constitution, and on Article 19(4) of the European Social Charter signed on 18 October 1961 and ratified by all the
( 1 ) Article II-84 of the Constitution.

Member States. Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ) is therefore applicable. The question of recruitment of seamen having the
nationality of third States for the crews of vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the Union is governed by Union
law and national legislation and practice.
Article 16 ( 2 )
Freedom to conduct a business
The freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices is
recognised.
Explanation
This Article is based on Court of Justice case-law which has recognised freedom to exercise an economic or commercial
activity (see judgments of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraph 14 of the grounds, and of
27 September 1979, Case 230-78 SPA Eridiana and others [1979] ECR 2749, paragraphs 20 and 31 of the grounds) and
freedom of contract (see inter alia Sukkerfabriken Nykøbing judgment, Case 151/78 [1979] ECR 1, paragraph 19 of the
grounds, and judgment of 5 October 1999, C-240/97 Spain v Commission, [1999] ECR I-6571, paragraph 99 of the
grounds) and Article I-3(2) of the Constitution, which recognises free competition. Of course, this right is to be
exercised with respect for Union law and national legislation. It may be subject to the limitations provided for in
Article 52(1) of the Charter ( 3 ).
Article 17 ( 4 )
Right to property</li>
<li>Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired
possessions. No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in
the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in
good time for their loss. The use of property may be regulated by law insofar as is necessary for the
general interest.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or
she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 of this Article has the same meaning and scope as Article 4 of Protocol 4 to the ECHR concerning
collective expulsion. Its purpose is to guarantee that every decision is based on a specific examination and that no single
measure can be taken to expel all persons having the nationality of a particular State (see also Article 13 of the Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights).
Paragraph 2 incorporates the relevant case-law from the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 3 of the
ECHR (see Ahmed v Austria, judgment of 17 December 1996, [1996] ECR VI-2206 and Soering, judgment of 7 July
1989).

TITLE III
EQUALITY
Article 20 ( 1 )
Equality before the law
Everyone is equal before the law.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to a general principle of law which is included in all European constitutions and has also been
recognised by the Court of Justice as a basic principle of Community law (judgment of 13 November 1984, Case 283/
83 Racke [1984] ECR 3791, judgment of 17 April 1997, Case 15/95 EARL [1997] ECR I-1961, and judgment of
13 April 2000, Case 292/97 Karlsson [2000] ECR 2737).
Article 21 ( 2 )
Non-discrimination</li>
<li>Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic
features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national
minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</li>
<li>Within the scope of application of the Constitution and without prejudice to any of its specific
provisions, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 draws on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-124 of the Constitution, Article 14 of the
ECHR and Article 11 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine as regards genetic heritage. Insofar as this
corresponds to Article 14 of the ECHR, it applies in compliance with it.
There is no contradiction or incompatibility between paragraph 1 and Article III-124 of the Constitution which has a
different scope and purpose: Article III-124 confers power on the Union to adopt legislative acts, including
harmonisation of the Member States&rsquo; laws and regulations, to combat certain forms of discrimination, listed
exhaustively in that Article. Such legislation may cover action of Member State authorities (as well as relations between
private individuals) in any area within the limits of the Union&rsquo;s powers. In contrast, the provision in paragraph 1 does
not create any power to enact anti-discrimination laws in these areas of Member State or private action, nor does it lay
down a sweeping ban of discrimination in such wide-ranging areas. Instead, it only addresses discriminations by the
institutions and bodies of the Union themselves, when exercising powers conferred under other articles of Parts I and III
( 1 ) Article II-80 of the Constitution.

of the Constitution, and by Member States only when they are implementing Union law. Paragraph 1 therefore does not
alter the extent of powers granted under Article III-124 nor the interpretation given to that Article.
Paragraph 2 corresponds to Article I-4(2) of the Constitution and must be applied in compliance with that Article.
Article 22 ( 1 )
Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity
The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and on Article 151(1) and (4) of the EC
Treaty, now replaced by Article III-280(1) and (4) of the Constitution, concerning culture. Respect for cultural and
linguistic diversity is now also laid down in Article I-3(3) of the Constitution. The Article is also inspired by Declaration
No 11 to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations, now
taken over in Article I-52 of the Constitution.
Article 23 ( 2 )
Equality between women and men
Equality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and
pay.
The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for
specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.
Explanation
The first paragraph has been based on Articles 2 and 3(2) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles I-3 and III-116 of
the Constitution which impose the objective of promoting equality between men and women on the Union, and on
Article 141(1) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(1) of the Constitution. It draws on Article 20 of the
revised European Social Charter of 3 May 1996 and on point 16 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
It is also based on Article 141(3) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(3) of the Constitution, and Article 2
(4) of Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as
regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
The second paragraph takes over in shorter form Article III-214(4) of the Constitution which provides that the principle
of equal treatment does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in order
to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for

Article III-214(4).
Article 24 ( 2 )
The rights of the child</li>
<li>Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being. They
may express their views freely. Such views shall be taken into consideration on matters which
concern them in accordance with their age and maturity.</li>
<li>In all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the
child&rsquo;s best interests must be a primary consideration.</li>
<li>Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct
contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests.
Explanation
This Article is based on the New York Convention on the Rights of the Child signed on 20 November 1989 and ratified
by all the Member States, particularly Articles 3, 9, 12 and 13 thereof.
Paragraph 3 takes account of the fact that, as part of the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, Union
legislation on civil matters having cross-border implications, for which Article III-269 of the Constitution confers
power, may include notably visiting rights ensuring that children can maintain on a regular basis a personal and direct
contact with both his or her parents.
Article 25 ( 3 )
The rights of the elderly
The Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence
and to participate in social and cultural life.
Explanation
This Article draws on Article 23 of the revised European Social Charter and Articles 24 and 25 of the Community
Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. Of course, participation in social and cultural life also covers
participation in political life.

SOLIDARITY
Article 27 ( 2 )
Workers&rsquo; right to information and consultation within the undertaking
Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and
consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Union law and
national laws and practices.
Explanation
This Article appears in the revised European Social Charter (Article 21) and in the Community Charter on the rights of
workers (points 17 and 18). It applies under the conditions laid down by Union law and by national laws. The reference
to appropriate levels refers to the levels laid down by Union law or by national laws and practices, which might include
the European level when Union legislation so provides. There is a considerable Union acquis in this field: Articles III-211
and III-212 of the Constitution, and Directives 2002/14/EC (general framework for informing and consulting employees
in the European Community), 98/59/EC (collective redundancies), 2001/23/EC (transfers of undertakings) and
94/45/EC (European works councils).
Article 28 ( 3 )
Right of collective bargaining and action
Workers and employers, or their respective organisations, have, in accordance with Union law and
national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the
appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their
interests, including strike action.

Explanation
This Article is based on Article 6 of the European Social Charter and on the Community Charter of the Fundamental
Social Rights of Workers (points 12 to 14). The right of collective action was recognised by the European Court of
Human Rights as one of the elements of trade union rights laid down by Article 11 of the ECHR. As regards the
appropriate levels at which collective negotiation might take place, see the explanation given for the above Article. The
modalities and limits for the exercise of collective action, including strike action, come under national laws and
practices, including the question of whether it may be carried out in parallel in several Member States.
Article 29 ( 1 )

Explanation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paragraph 1 of this Article is based on Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage
improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. It also draws on Article 3 of the Social Charter and point 19
of the Community Charter on the rights of workers, and, as regards dignity at work, on Article 26 of the revised Social
Charter. The expression ‘working conditions’ must be understood in the sense of Article III-213 of the Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paragraph 2 is based on Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time,
Article 2 of the European Social Charter and point 8 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
Article 32 ( 1 )
Prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work
The employment of children is prohibited. The minimum age of admission to employment may not
be lower than the minimum school-leaving age, without prejudice to such rules as may be more
favourable to young people and except for limited derogations.
Young people admitted to work must have working conditions appropriate to their age and be
protected against economic exploitation and any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical,
mental, moral or social development or to interfere with their education.
Explanation
This Article is based on Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work, Article 7 of the European Social
Charter and points 20 to 23 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
Article 33 ( 2 )
Family and professional life</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>To reconcile family and professional life, everyone shall have the right to protection from
dismissal for a reason connected with maternity and the right to paid maternity leave and to parental
leave following the birth or adoption of a child.
Explanation
Article 33(1) ( 2 ) is based on Article 16 of the European Social Charter.

The second paragraph draws on Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage
improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are
breastfeeding and Directive 96/34/EC on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and
the ETUC. It is also based on Article 8 (protection of maternity) of the European Social Charter and draws on Article 27
(right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment) of the revised Social Charter.
‘Maternity’ covers the period from conception to weaning.
Article 34 ( 1 )
Social security and social assistance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Union recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services
providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age,
and in the case of loss of employment, in accordance with the rules laid down by Union law and
national laws and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone residing and moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security
benefits and social advantages in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to combat social exclusion and poverty, the Union recognises and respects the right to
social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient
resources, in accordance with the rules laid down by Union law and national laws and practices.
Explanation
The principle set out in Article 34(1) ( 1 ) is based on Articles 137 and 140 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles III-
210 and III-213 and on Article 12 of the European Social Charter and point 10 of the Community Charter on the rights
of workers. The Union must respect it when exercising the powers conferred on it by Articles III-210 and III-213 of the
Constitution. The reference to social services relates to cases in which such services have been introduced to provide
certain advantages but does not imply that such services must be created where they do not exist. ‘Maternity’ must be
understood in the same sense as in the preceding Article.
Paragraph 2 is based on Articles 12(4) and 13(4) of the European Social Charter and point 2 of the Community Charter
of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and reflects the rules arising from Regulation No 1408/71 and Regulation
No 1612/68.
Paragraph 3 draws on Article 13 of the European Social Charter and Articles 30 and 31 of the revised Social Charter
and point 10 of the Community Charter. The Union must respect it in the context of policies based on Article III-210 of
the Constitution.

treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices. A high level of human
health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and
activities.
Explanation
The principles set out in this Article are based on Article 152 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-278 of the

Article 36 ( 2 )
Access to services of general economic interest
The Union recognises and respects access to services of general economic interest as provided for in
national laws and practices, in accordance with the Constitution, in order to promote the social and
territorial cohesion of the Union.
Explanation
This Article is fully in line with Article III-122 of the Constitution and does not create any new right. It merely sets out
the principle of respect by the Union for the access to services of general economic interest as provided for by national
provisions, when those provisions are compatible with Union law.
Article 37 ( 3 )
Environmental protection
A high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the environment
must be integrated into the policies of the Union and ensured in accordance with the principle of
sustainable development.
Explanation
The principles set out in this Article have been based on Articles 2, 6 and 174 of the EC Treaty, which have now been
replaced by Articles I-3(3), III-119 and III-233 of the Constitution.
It also draws on the provisions of some national constitutions.

secret ballot.
Explanation
Article 39 ( 2 ) applies under the conditions laid down in Parts I and III of the Constitution, in accordance with Article 52

Explanation
This Article corresponds to the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2) of the Constitution (see also the legal base in
Article III-126 for the adoption of detailed arrangements for the exercise of that right). In accordance with Article 52(2)
of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions set out in these Articles of Parts I and III of the Constitution.
Article 41 ( 2 )
Right to good administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a
reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Every person has the right to have the Union make good any damage caused by its institutions or
by its servants in the performance of their duties, in accordance with the general principles common
to the laws of the Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of
the Constitution and must have an answer in the same language.
Explanation
Article 41 ( 2 ) is based on the existence of the Union as subject to the rule of law whose characteristics were developed in
the case-law which enshrined, inter alia, good administration as a general principle of law (see, inter alia, Court of Justice
judgment of 31 March 1992 in Case C-255/90 P, Burban [1992] ECR I-2253, and Court of First Instance judgments of
18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-2589, and 9 July 1999 in Case T-231/97 New Europe
Consulting and others [1999] ECR II-2403). The wording for that right in the first two paragraphs results from the case-
law (Court of Justice judgment of 15 October 1987 in Case 222/86 Heylens [1987] ECR 4097, paragraph 15 of the
grounds, judgment of 18 October 1989 in Case 374/87 Orkem [1989] ECR 3283, judgment of 21 November 1991 in
Case C-269/90 TU München [1991] ECR I-5469, and Court of First Instance judgments of 6 December 1994 in Case T-
450/93 Lisrestal [1994] ECR II-1177, 18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-258) and the wording
regarding the obligation to give reasons comes from Article 253 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article I-38(2) of the
Constitution (see also the legal base in Article III-398 of the Constitution for the adoption of legislation in the interest
of an open, efficient and independent European administration).

Paragraph 3 reproduces the right now guaranteed by Article III-431 of the Constitution. Paragraph 4 reproduces the
right now guaranteed by Articles I-10(2)(d) and III-129 of the Constitution. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the
Charter ( 1 ), those rights are to be applied under the conditions and within the limits defined by Part III of the
Constitution.
The right to an effective remedy, which is an important aspect of this question, is guaranteed in Article 47 of this
Charter ( 2 ).
Article 42 ( 3 )
Right of access to documents
Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State, has a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of
the Union, whatever their medium.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article has been taken over from Article 255 of the EC Treaty, on the basis of which
Regulation 1049/2001 has subsequently been adopted. The European Convention has extended this right to documents
of institutions, bodies and agencies generally, regardless of their form, see Article I-50(3) of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), the right of access to documents is exercised under the conditions and
within the limits for which provision is made in Articles I-50(3) and III-399.
Article 43 ( 4 )
European Ombudsman
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State has the right to refer to the European Ombudsman cases of maladministration in the
activities of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, with the exception of the Court
of Justice of the European Union acting in its judicial role.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article is the right guaranteed by Articles I-10 and III-335 of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these two Articles.
( 1 ) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.

Article 44 ( 1 )
Right to petition
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State has the right to petition the European Parliament.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article is the right guaranteed by Articles I-10 and III-334 of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 2 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these two Articles.
Article 45 ( 3 )
Freedom of movement and of residence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every citizen of the Union has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the
Member States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom of movement and residence may be granted, in accordance with the Constitution, to
nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State.
Explanation
The right guaranteed by paragraph 1 is the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2)(a) of the Constitution (cf. also the legal
base in Article III-125; and the judgement of the Court of Justice of 17 September 2002, C-413/99 Baumbast, [2002]
ECR 709). In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 2 ), it applies under the conditions and within the limits
defined for which provision is made in Part III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 refers to the power granted to the Union by Articles III-265 to III-267 of the Constitution. Consequently,
the granting of this right depends on the institutions exercising that power.
Article 46 ( 4 )
Diplomatic and consular protection
Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of
which he or she is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or
consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that
Member State.

Explanation
The right guaranteed by this Article is the right guaranteed by Article I-10 of the Constitution; cf. also the legal base in
Article III-127. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these
Articles.
TITLE VI
JUSTICE
Article 47 ( 2 )
Right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial
Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to
an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article.
Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised,
defended and represented.
Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary
to ensure effective access to justice.
Explanation
The first paragraph is based on Article 13 of the ECHR:
‘Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a
national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.’
However, in Union law the protection is more extensive since it guarantees the right to an effective remedy before a
court. The Court of Justice enshrined that right in its judgment of 15 May 1986 as a general principle of Union law
(Case 222/84 Johnston [1986] ECR 1651; see also judgment of 15 October 1987, Case 222/86 Heylens [1987]
ECR 4097 and judgment of 3 December 1992, Case C-97/91 Borelli [1992] ECR I-6313). According to the Court, that
general principle of Union law also applies to the Member States when they are implementing Union law. The inclusion
of this precedent in the Charter has not been intended to change the system of judicial review laid down by the Treaties,
and particularly the rules relating to admissibility for direct actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The European Convention has considered the Union&rsquo;s system of judicial review including the rules on admissibility, and
confirmed them while amending them as to certain aspects, as reflected in Articles III-353 to III-381 of the
Constitution, and in particular in Article III-365(4). Article 47 ( 2 ) applies to the institutions of the Union and of
Member States when they are implementing Union law and does so for all rights guaranteed by Union law.

The second paragraph corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows:
‘In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a
fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment
shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of
morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the
private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special
circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.’
In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations. That is
one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in
Case 294/83, ‘Les Verts’ v European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339). Nevertheless, in all
respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.
With regard to the third paragraph, it should be noted that in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of
Human Rights, provision should be made for legal aid where the absence of such aid would make it impossible to
ensure an effective remedy (ECHR Judgment of 9 October 1979, Airey, Series A, Volume 32, 11). There is also a system
of legal assistance for cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Article 48 ( 1 )
Presumption of innocence and right of defence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone who has been charged shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect for the rights of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed.
Explanation
Article 48 ( 1 ) is the same as Article 6(2) and (3) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did
not constitute a criminal offence under national law or international law at the time when it was
committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than that which was applicable at the time the
criminal offence was committed. If, subsequent to the commission of a criminal offence, the law
provides for a lighter penalty, that penalty shall be applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission
which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles
recognised by the community of nations.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time
when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.’

In paragraph 2, the reference to ‘civilised’ nations has been deleted; this does not change the meaning of this
paragraph, which refers to crimes against humanity in particular. In accordance with Article 52(3) ( 1 ), the right
guaranteed here therefore has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by the ECHR.
Paragraph 3 states the general principle of proportionality between penalties and criminal offences which is
enshrined in the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and in the case-law of the Court of Justice
of the Communities.
Article 50 ( 2 )
Right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for an offence for which
he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted within the Union in accordance with the law.
Explanation
Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR reads as follows:
‘1. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State
for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal
procedure of that State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law
and the penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has
been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No derogation from this Article shall be made under Article 15 of the Convention.’
The ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies in Union law (see, among the many precedents, the judgment of 5 May 1966, Cases
18/65 and 35/65, Gutmann v Commission [1966] ECR 103 and a recent case, the decision of the Court of First
Instance of 20 April 1999, Joined Cases T-305/94 and others, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij NV v. Commission [1999]
ECR II-931). The rule prohibiting cumulation refers to cumulation of two penalties of the same kind, that is to say
criminal law penalties.
In accordance with Article 50 ( 2 ), the ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies not only within the jurisdiction of one State but also
between the jurisdictions of several Member States. That corresponds to the acquis in Union law; see Articles 54 to 58 of
the Schengen Convention and the judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 February 2003, C-187/01 Gözütok (not yet
published), Article 7 of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities&rsquo; Financial Interests and
Article 10 of the Convention on the fight against corruption. The very limited exceptions in those Conventions
permitting the Member States to derogate from the ‘non bis in idem’ rule are covered by the horizontal clause in
Article 52(1) of the Charter ( 3 ) concerning limitations. As regards the situations referred to by Article 4 of Protocol
No 7, namely the application of the principle within the same Member State, the guaranteed right has the same meaning
and the same scope as the corresponding right in the ECHR.

TITLE VII
GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER
Article 51 ( 1 )
Field of application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of
the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they
are implementing Union law. They shall therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and
promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers and respecting the limits
of the powers of the Union as conferred on it in the other Parts of the Constitution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of
the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined in
the other Parts of the Constitution.
Explanation
The aim of Article 51 ( 1 ) is to determine the scope of the Charter. It seeks to establish clearly that the Charter applies
primarily to the institutions and bodies of the Union, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This provision
was drafted in keeping with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which required the Union to respect
fundamental rights, and with the mandate issued by Cologne European Council. The term ‘institutions’ is enshrined in
Part I of the Constitution. The expression ‘bodies, offices and agencies’ is commonly used in the Constitution to refer to
all the authorities set up by the Constitution or by secondary legislation (see, e.g., Articles I-50 or I-51 of the
Constitution).
As regards the Member States, it follows unambiguously from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the requirement
to respect fundamental rights defined in a Union context is only binding on the Member States when they act in the
scope of Union law (judgment of 13 July 1989, Case 5/88 Wachauf [1989] ECR 2609; judgment of 18 June 1991, ERT
[1991] ECR I-2925); judgment of 18 December 1997 (C-309/96 Annibaldi [1997] ECR I-7493). The Court of Justice
confirmed this case-law in the following terms: ‘In addition, it should be remembered that the requirements flowing
from the protection of fundamental rights in the Community legal order are also binding on Member States when they
implement Community rules &hellip;’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, [2000] ECR 2737, paragraph 37 of the
grounds). Of course this rule, as enshrined in this Charter, applies to the central authorities as well as to regional or local
bodies, and to public organisations, when they are implementing Union law.
Paragraph 2, together with the second sentence of paragraph 1, confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of
extending the competences and tasks which the other Parts of the Constitution confer on the Union. Explicit mention is
made here of the logical consequences of the principle of subsidiarity and of the fact that the Union only has those
powers which have been conferred upon it. The fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Union do not have any effect
other than in the context of the powers determined by Parts I and III of the Constitution. Consequently, an obligation,
pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph 1, for the Union&rsquo;s institutions to promote principles laid down in the

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe

Paragraph 2 also confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of extending the field of application of Union law
beyond the powers of the Union as established in the other Parts of the Constitution. The Court of Justice has already
established this rule with respect to the fundamental rights recognised as part of Union law (judgment of 17 February
1998, C-249/96 Grant, 1998 ECR I-621, paragraph 45 of the grounds). In accordance with this rule, it goes without
saying that the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution cannot be understood as extending by itself the range
of Member State action considered to be ‘implementation of Union law’ (within the meaning of paragraph 1 and the
above-mentioned case-law).
Article 52 ( 1 )
Scope and interpretation of rights and principles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be
provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of
proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of
general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in other Parts of the Constitution
shall be exercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by these relevant Parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those
rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent
Union law providing more extensive protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insofar as this Charter recognises fundamental rights as they result from the constitutional
traditions common to the Member States, those rights shall be interpreted in harmony with those
traditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and
executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of
Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers.
They shall be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their
legality.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The explanations drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights shall be given due regard by the courts of the Union and of the Member States.

Final act
Explanation
The purpose of Article 52 ( 1 ) is to set the scope of the rights and principles of the Charter, and to lay down rules for
their interpretation. Paragraph 1 deals with the arrangements for the limitation of rights. The wording is based on the
case-law of the Court of Justice: ‘&hellip; it is well established in the case-law of the Court that restrictions may be imposed on
the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular in the context of a common organisation of the market, provided that
those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and do not constitute,
with regard to the aim pursued, disproportionate and unreasonable interference undermining the very substance of
those rights’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, paragraph 45 of the grounds). The reference to general
interests recognised by the Union covers both the objectives mentioned in Article I-2 of the Constitution and other
interests protected by specific provisions of the Constitution such as Articles I-5(1), III-133(3), III-154 and III-436.
Paragraph 2 refers to rights which were already expressly guaranteed in the Treaty establishing the European
Community and have been recognised in the Charter, and which are now found in other Parts of the Constitution
(notably the rights derived from Union citizenship). It clarifies that such rights remain subject to the conditions and
limits applicable to the Union law on which they are based, and for which provision is now made in Parts I and III of the
Constitution. The Charter does not alter the system of rights conferred by the EC Treaty and now taken over by Parts I
and III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 3 is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the Charter and the ECHR by establishing the rule
that, insofar as the rights in the present Charter also correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR, the meaning and
scope of those rights, including authorised limitations, are the same as those laid down by the ECHR. This means in
particular that the legislator, in laying down limitations to those rights, must comply with the same standards as are
fixed by the detailed limitation arrangements laid down in the ECHR, which are thus made applicable for the rights
covered by this paragraph, without thereby adversely affecting the autonomy of Union law and of that of the Court of
Justice of the European Union.
The reference to the ECHR covers both the Convention and the Protocols to it. The meaning and the scope of the
guaranteed rights are determined not only by the text of those instruments, but also by the case-law of the European
Court of Human Rights and by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The last sentence of the paragraph is
designed to allow the Union to guarantee more extensive protection. In any event, the level of protection afforded by
the Charter may never be lower than that guaranteed by the ECHR.
The Charter does not affect the possibilities of Member States to avail themselves of Article 15 ECHR, allowing
derogations from ECHR rights in the event of war or of other public dangers threatening the life of the nation, when
they take action in the areas of national defence in the event of war and of the maintenance of law and order, in
accordance with their responsibilities recognised in Articles I-5 (1), III-131, III-262 of the Constitution.
The list of rights which may at the present stage, without precluding developments in the law, legislation and the
Treaties, be regarded as corresponding to rights in the ECHR within the meaning of the present paragraph is given
hereafter. It does not include rights additional to those in the ECHR.</p>

<p>Declaration on Article IV-440(7)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The High Contracting Parties agree that the European Council, pursuant to Article IV-440(7), will
take a European decision leading to the modification of the status of Mayotte with regard to the
Union in order to make this territory an outermost region within the meaning of Article IV-440(2)
and Article III-424, when the French authorities notify the European Council and the Commission
that the evolution currently underway in the internal status of the island so allows.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Declaration on Article IV-448(2)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Conference considers that the possibility of producing translations of the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe in the languages mentioned in Article IV-448(2) contributes to fulfilling the
objective of respecting the Union&rsquo;s rich cultural and linguistic diversity as set forth in the
fourth subparagraph of Article I-3(3) of that Treaty. In this context, the Conference confirms the
attachment of the Union to the cultural diversity of Europe and the special attention it will continue
to pay to these and other languages.
The Conference recommends that those Member States wishing to avail themselves of the possibility
recognised in Article IV-448(2) communicate to the Council, within six months from the date of the
signature of that Treaty, the language or languages into which translations of that Treaty will be
made.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Declaration on the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe
The Conference notes that if, two years after the signature of the Treaty establishing a Constitution
for Europe, four fifths of the Member States have ratified it and one or more Member States have
encountered difficulties in proceeding with ratification, the matter will be referred to the European
Council.</li>
