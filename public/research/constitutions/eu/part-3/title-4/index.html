                        <p>TITLE 4: ASSOCIATION OF THE OVERSEAS COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES
Article III‑286</p>
<ol>
<li>The non‑European countries and territories which have special relations with Denmark, France,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom shall be associated with the Union. These countries and
territories, hereinafter called the ‘countries and territories’, are listed in Annex II.
This title shall apply to Greenland, subject to the specific provisions of the Protocol on special

Part III</li>
<li>The purpose of association shall be to promote the economic and social development of the
countries and territories and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union.
Association shall serve primarily to further the interests and prosperity of the inhabitants of these
countries and territories in order to lead them to the economic, social and cultural development to
which they aspire.
Article III-287
Association shall have the following objectives:
(a) Member States shall apply to their trade with the countries and territories the same treatment as
they accord each other pursuant to the Constitution;
(b) each country or territory shall apply to its trade with Member States and with the other countries
and territories the same treatment as that which it applies to the European State with which it has
special relations;
(c) Member States shall contribute to the investments required for the progressive development of
these countries and territories;
(d) for investments financed by the Union, participation in tenders and supplies shall be open on
equal terms to all natural and legal persons who are nationals of a Member State or of one of the
countries and territories;
(e) in relations between Member States and the countries and territories, the right of establishment
of nationals and companies or firms shall be regulated in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection 2 of Section 2 of Chapter I of Title III relating to the freedom of establishment and
under the procedures laid down in that Subsection, and on a non‑discriminatory basis, subject to
any acts adopted pursuant to Article III‑291.
Article III-288</li>
<li>Customs duties on imports into the Member States of goods originating in the countries and
territories shall be prohibited in conformity with the prohibition of customs duties between
Member States provided for in the Constitution.</li>
<li>Customs duties on imports into each country or territory from Member States or from the other
countries or territories shall be prohibited in accordance with Article III‑151(4).</li>
<li>The countries and territories may, however, levy customs duties which meet the needs of their
development and industrialisation or produce revenue for their budgets.
The duties referred to in the first subparagraph shall not exceed the level of those imposed on
imports of products from the Member State with which each country or territory has special
relations.954393_TRAITE_EN_101_150

Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe
137</li>
<li>Paragraph 2 shall not apply to countries and territories which, by reason of the particular
international obligations by which they are bound, already apply a non‑discriminatory customs tariff.</li>
<li>The introduction of or any change in customs duties imposed on goods imported into the
countries and territories shall not, either in law or in fact, give rise to any direct or indirect
discrimination between imports from the various Member States.
Article III-289
If the level of the duties applicable to goods from a third country on entry into a country or territory
is liable, when Article III‑288(1) has been applied, to cause deflections of trade to the detriment of
any Member State, the latter may request the Commission to propose to the other Member States that
they take the necessary measures to remedy the situation.
Article III-290
Subject to the provisions relating to public health, public security or public policy, freedom of
movement within Member States for workers from the countries and territories, and within the
countries and territories for workers from Member States, shall be regulated by acts adopted in
accordance with Article III‑291.
Article III-291
The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt unanimously, on the basis of the
experience acquired under the association of the countries and territories with the Union, European
laws, framework laws, regulations and decisions as regards the detailed rules and the procedure for
the association of the countries and territories with the Union. These laws and framework laws shall
be adopted after consultation of the European Parliament.

CHAPTER III
ENHANCED COOPERATION
Article III-416
Any enhanced cooperation shall comply with the Constitution and the law of the Union.
Such cooperation shall not undermine the internal market or economic, social and territorial
cohesion. It shall not constitute a barrier to or discrimination in trade between Member States, nor
shall it distort competition between them.
Article III-417
Any enhanced cooperation shall respect the competences, rights and obligations of those Member
States which do not participate in it. Those Member States shall not impede its implementation by
the participating Member States.
Article III-418</li>
<li>When enhanced cooperation is being established, it shall be open to all Member States, subject to
compliance with any conditions of participation laid down by the European authorising decision. It
shall also be open to them at any other time, subject to compliance with the acts already adopted
within that framework, in addition to any such conditions.
The Commission and the Member States participating in enhanced cooperation shall ensure that they
promote participation by as many Member States as possible.</li>
<li>The Commission and, where appropriate, the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs shall keep the
European Parliament and the Council regularly informed regarding developments in enhanced
cooperation.
Article III-419</li>
<li>Member States which wish to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in one of the
areas covered by the Constitution, with the exception of fields of exclusive competence and the
common foreign and security policy, shall address a request to the Commission, specifying the scope
and objectives of the enhanced cooperation proposed. The Commission may submit a proposal to
the Council to that effect. In the event of the Commission not submitting a proposal, it shall inform
the Member States concerned of the reasons for not doing so.
Authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation shall be granted by a European decision of the
Council, which shall act on a proposal from the Commission and after obtaining the consent of the
European Parliament.</li>
<li>The request of the Member States which wish to establish enhanced cooperation between
themselves within the framework of the common foreign and security policy shall be addressed to
the Council. It shall be forwarded to the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, who shall give an opinion
on whether the enhanced cooperation proposed is consistent with the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and
security policy, and to the Commission, which shall give its opinion in particular on whether the954393_TRAITE_EN_151_200

enhanced cooperation proposed is consistent with other Union policies. It shall also be forwarded to
the European Parliament for information.
Authorisation to proceed with enhanced cooperation shall be granted by a European decision of the
Council acting unanimously.
Article III-420</li>
<li>Any Member State which wishes to participate in enhanced cooperation in progress in one of the
areas referred to in Article III-419(1) shall notify its intention to the Council and the Commission.
The Commission shall, within four months of the date of receipt of the notification, confirm the
participation of the Member State concerned. It shall note where necessary that the conditions of
participation have been fulfilled and shall adopt any transitional measures necessary with regard to
the application of the acts already adopted within the framework of enhanced cooperation.
However, if the Commission considers that the conditions of participation have not been fulfilled, it
shall indicate the arrangements to be adopted to fulfil those conditions and shall set a deadline for re-
examining the request. On the expiry of that deadline, it shall re-examine the request, in accordance
with the procedure set out in the second subparagraph. If the Commission considers that the
conditions of participation have still not been met, the Member State concerned may refer the matter
to the Council, which shall decide on the request. The Council shall act in accordance with Article I-
44(3). It may also adopt the transitional measures referred to in the second subparagraph on a
proposal from the Commission.</li>
<li>Any Member State which wishes to participate in enhanced cooperation in progress in the
framework of the common foreign and security policy shall notify its intention to the Council, the
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Commission.
The Council shall confirm the participation of the Member State concerned, after consulting the
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs and after noting, where necessary, that the conditions of
participation have been fulfilled. The Council, on a proposal from the Union Minister for Foreign
Affairs, may also adopt any transitional measures necessary with regard to the application of the acts
already adopted within the framework of enhanced cooperation. However, if the Council considers
that the conditions of participation have not been fulfilled, it shall indicate the arrangements to be
adopted to fulfil those conditions and shall set a deadline for re-examining the request for
participation.
For the purposes of this paragraph, the Council shall act unanimously and in accordance with
Article I-44(3).

Expenditure resulting from implementation of enhanced cooperation, other than administrative costs
entailed for the institutions, shall be borne by the participating Member States, unless all members of

by a European law or framework law where necessary for the performance of the Union&rsquo;s activities.</li>

about undertakings, their business relations or their cost components.
Article III-431
The Union&rsquo;s contractual liability shall be governed by the law applicable to the contract in question.
In the case of non-contractual liability, the Union shall, in accordance with the general principles
common to the laws of the Member States, make good any damage caused by its institutions or by its
servants in the performance of their duties.</li>

States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and
one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the Constitution.
To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Constitution, the Member State or
States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established.
Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate,
adopt a common attitude.
In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account
the fact that the advantages accorded under the Constitution by each Member State form an integral
part of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of institutions on which
powers have been conferred by the Constitution and the granting of identical advantages by all the
other Member States.
Article III-436
1.
The Constitution shall not preclude the application of the following rules:
(a) no Member State shall be obliged to supply information the disclosure of which it considers
contrary to the essential interests of its security;954393_TRAITE_EN_151_200

(b) any Member State may take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the
essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms,
munitions and war material; such measures shall not adversely affect the conditions of
competition in the internal market regarding products which are not intended for specifically
military purposes.
2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may unanimously adopt a European decision
making changes to the list of 15 April 1958 of the products to which the provisions of paragraph 1
