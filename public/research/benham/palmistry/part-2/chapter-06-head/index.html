                        <p>The line of the Head is the second line which receives the Electric Current when it enters our bodies through the finger of Jupiter. It runs <!-- raw HTML omitted --> across the hand below the line of Heart.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It absolutely indicates the subject&rsquo;s:</p>
<ul>
<li>amount of mentality</li>
<li>kind of mentality</li>
<li>power of mental concentration</li>
<li>ability to exert self-control.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The mind plays a tremendous part in the shaping of our destiny.</p>
<p>No matter how fine the rest of the human machine may be, it can never operate perfectly unless there is a proper mental attitude.</p>
<p>The mental attitude cannot be what it should be unless the brain is physically healthy and the subject possesses the ability to concentrate his mind and thus go through life with definite-ness of purpose.</p>
<p>Mind is the force that enables us to alter our natural life map, makes us able to modify our type qualities, and, more powerfully than any other factor, influences the life of every human being.</p>
<p>The kind of mind that each subject possesses will be largely the key to his future, for it makes him whatever he is, improves or mars his natural self, builds up or tears down the strong places in his character, and acts correspondingly with the weak ones.</p>
<p>Thus, the Head line will demand the closest study to correctly determine the quality and quantity of brain power present.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The brain emanates the vital force that throbs along every nerve in the body. Whatever reflects it is also a wonderful revealer of disease, especially of those disorders termed nervous.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The brain is so carefully protected that it cannot be studied minutely during life. This makes us <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ignorant of how it leads to good and evil actions.</p>
<p>But the hand is always present to be studied. The Head line shows the inner workings of the mind.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the same way it is most accurate in disclosing diseases due to an impairment of the brain, and extending from it to the nervous system. In beginning a study of the line of Head, your first care should be to locate it, and if it be absent, to discover that fact.</p>
<p>The mind, working through the brain, is the force which operates directly on all lines. This makes the Head line seldom absent, for it is the indicator of that which produces lines.</p>
<p>However, often only a single line crosses the hand. You might not know whether it is <!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Head or the Heart line.</p>
<p>In 99% of cases, such a single line is the Head line and it is the Heart line which is absent.</p>
<p>I think it best to read such single lines invariably as lines of Head. The length of the Head line should next have your attention. It should not run to the percussion as does the Heart line, but if the line runs across the hand, as in No. 82, it tells by its length of abundant mentality the kind to be estimated by the character and color of the line.</p>
<p>A short Head line (83) indicates that the subject is not so &quot; long headed&quot; (has not strong mentality). It may also mean that the subject&rsquo;s life is short and stops where the Head line ends. Illness and duration of life are to be read on several of the lines and not on the Life line alone.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If a short Head line also has a short Life line, matching in length with the Head line (84), the fatality is quite certain.</p>
<p>If a star is seen on the end of this short Head line (85) the indication will be sudden death, the star showing the explosion.</p>
<p>If a star be seen on the end of both the short lines of Head and Life (86) the fatality may be read confidently if seen in the right hand, or, as threatened, if seen in the left hand.</p>
<p>The larger and better formed these stars, the more certain the indication.</p>
<p>A cross on the end of a short Head line must be read as stopping the Current, ending the mentality, and producing death, but not so surely by apoplexy or in a sudden manner as if indicated by well-formed stars.</p>
<p>A cross on the end of a short Head line, and of a Life line (87) must be read as an indication which is nearly as strong as a star. These defects stop the Current, and life cannot continue unless the Current flows freely. With these markings note in every case the type of subject, also color of the line or sign.</p>
<p>If Jupiterian (predisposed to apoplexy), Saturnian (predisposed to paralysis), Martian (who has large blood supply in brain), these indications will be more serious, especially if found red or pronouncedly yellow in color.</p>
<p>In all short Head lines the accompanying signs on the Life line, Mercury line, Heart line, and Mounts must be noted, in order to distinguish whether the subject lacks mentality or is predisposed to disease, as in the above cases. The long Head line per se shows abundant mentality and the short line less of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In this examination for the length of the line, proportion must always be kept in mind. If the Head line extends across the entire hand in a straight line (88), with a Heart line normal, it will show the preponderance of head and the subject will be out of balance in this respect.</p>
<p>He will:</p>
<ul>
<li>be avaricious</li>
<li>view all things from the mental standpoint</li>
<li>make sentiment subservient to interest</li>
<li>be practical in all things</li>
<li>be more interested in whatever is capable of producing direct results than in beautiful things which please the eye or appeal to the heart.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this long, straight Head line has no accompanying Heart line, the subject will be cold, heartless, merciless, miserly, avaricious, extortionate, and demanding his &ldquo;pound of flesh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The proportionate depth and character of all the lines must be noted.</p>
<p>If the Head line be straight and long and also deep, it makes a stronger combination. When the Head line without the Heart line is found also long and it is straight and deep, it makes worldly interests greater and the subject harder and more avaricious.</p>
<p>If this line is also red, it makes the subject aggressive in his avarice, and if yellow he will be doubly mean and hard. If the Head line be long, but thinner and smaller than the other lines, the head will be on a constant strain and must not be overworked or the brain will be wrecked.</p>
<p>If the line be short, narrow, and shallow, it will be a pronounced indication of small mentality.</p>
<p>If all the other lines are deep and well cut, and the Head line short and thin, it shows a person easily led, weak in mentality, the servant and creature of others, never the leader.</p>
<p>So, together with the length of the line, must be estimated its size and proportion to the other lines, and the subject must be placed above or below the normal balance in accordance with the proportion found.</p>
<p>In every case use both hands. If the line be short in the left hand and long in the right, the subject has developed his mentality. If the line be long in the left hand and short in the right, he has retrograded mentally, or else there is danger of fatality from the short line.</p>
<p>Examine at once Life line, type, and all health indications to discover which. If the line be narrow and thin in the left hand and deep and well cut in the right, the subject is improving mentally. If this combination is reversed the opposite condition is present.</p>
<p>If the line be long and straight in the left hand and shows the same formation in the right, but with the Heart line absent in the right hand, the subject is naturally grasping and self-interested, and these qualities in him have been tremendously increased until he has become intensely selfish and avaricious.</p>
<p>By noting in this way the two hands and their changed condition of lines, you will be able to read changes from the past to a present mental attitude, and can tell the subject how he formerly regarded certain matters and how he views them at present. The Line Of Head Part 2 245 No. 88. One of the first things to do in reading the Head line is to distinguish disease from character of the mentality. To do this it will be necessary to use not only defects in the line arising from breaks, dots, islands, and similar causes, but also the narrowness and thinness of the line, as well as its proportion to other lines. Inasmuch as the Head line indicates both the extent and character of the mentality and also diseases, it will be necessary at times when a defective line is seen, to distinguish between the two and to estimate whether your subject is lacking in character directions, or whether brain illness or insanity are indicated.</p>
<p>Any defect seen on the Head line will indicate mental disturbance, which may be the result of illness, or it may be an indication of the unsteady character of the mentality. In making a distinction between character and diseases the Life line should be examined to see if it is also defective at about the same period as the defect appears on the Head line. Anything abnormal found on the Life line will fix the defect on the Head line as an illness. The nails must also be consulted in connection with the Head line, for if badly fluted they tell of great nervous disturbance, which is emanating from the centre of nerve force, the brain. If in addition to a defective Head line, fluted and brittle nails are found you are warned that the subject is using up his nervous vitality faster than it can be generated and is in danger of paralysis. This is further confirmed if the subject be either a Saturnian, Mer-curian, or Lunarian. The color of the hand and particularly of the lines is exceedingly important in this investigation. If too white, the anaemic condition furnishes little blood, and the operation of the brain will be weakened. On the other hand, extreme redness will show that blood in excessive quantity and in too great strength is being forced to the brain. Either of these indications show an abnormal condition and indicate disease, whiteness predisposing to weakness and insufficiency, and redness indicating liability to fevers or apoplexy. The latter condition is to be read from the presence of stars, crosses, dots, or deep cutting of the line, red color being also present with these markings. When a defective Head line is noted, use the Life line as indicated above, the Mercury line in the same way as the Life line, together with nails and color, for all these must be consulted along with the type of the subject, and from this combined point of view you will be able to distinguish health defects from mental defects.</p>
<p>The Line Of Head Part 2 246 No. 89. The Line Of Head Part 2 247 No. 90. The starting-point or source of the Head line must be noted. In the greater number of hands the line rises from the line of Life, to which it is slightly attached at the start (89), and branches away from the Life line, sometimes near the beginning of that line, sometimes farther along (90). At this point the Head line registers the early years of life, and the sooner the line separates from the Life line, the younger was the subject when he began to think for himself. The longer the Head line is tied to the Life line the less self-confidence has the subject and the more he relies upon the advice of others. The longer the period covered by this union of the two lines, the later in life did the subject begin to rely upon himself. The Head line is not often bound to the Life line longer than the twelfth year, and many Head lines are seen which only touch the Life line at its beginning, showing that as a mere child the subject was self-reliant. In examining the beginning of the Head line note how sharp the angle formed by the lines of Head and Life. The more pointed this angle (90), the more sensitive the subject, the easier are his feelings hurt, and if in addition the sensitive pads are found on the ends of the fingers, this sensitive disposition will be extreme. The subject will do almost anything rather than hurt the feelings of others, and the lives of such will be often made unhappy by unintentional slights. The type of the subject and his finger-tips must be taken into consideration here. With pointed tips and this acute angle the subject will be entirely lacking in self-reliance, timid, cautious, leaning constantly upon someone else, and suffering a fall every time the support is taken away. With thick fingers and square or spatulate tips the indications will not be extreme sensitiveness, but must be read as denoting prudence and caution. Often the Head line is merged in the Life line at the start, and in this case the head did not begin to assert itself, but the subject depended upon others until the year when the line breaks away from the line of Life. Sometimes the Head line does not leave the Life line until well along in its course (91).</p>
<p>In this case the mental activities began later in life. This even goes so far as to produce in some hands the formation of an obtuse angle (92), which shows the subject to be somewhat callous to slights. If, with this latter marking, the finger-tips be square or spatulate and the fingers and palm thick and red, the subject will be very dense, and if only the lines of Head, Heart, and Life are present, it will indicate elementary heaviness of intellect and unimpressionability. These subjects will be cautious, non-committal, dependent on others, lacking ability to command, unoriginal, blunt, and tactless. When the line of Head is distinctly separated from the line of Life (93) it shows primarily self-reliance. The subject is original, is not bound down by the views of others, acts for and depends upon himself, can plan well, is guided by his own judgment, is independent and courageous in his views, and therefore this separation, if not too wide, is a fine marking. The wider the separation the greater the degree of self-reliance, consequently the marking may degenerate into such boldness and self-esteem that the subject becomes foolhardy and not a safe counsellor. With this separated line note the tips, for, if pointed, the self-reliance may run to idealism, if spat-ulate, to great energy and originality, producing a brain fertile in new schemes, and, as the subject does not ask advice, he is likely to commit grave errors. Square tips are safest, for their good common-sense will be a restraining element. Note the length of the fingers, for, if very short, the quickness in making up the mind, added to the self-reliance of the separated lines, easily leads to impulsive, hasty, and dangerous conclusions. If, in addition, the fingers are smooth, impulsiveness will be intensified. Knots indicate a restraining element that it is good to have present with these separated lines. This marking, in whatever degree of separation it is seen, always indicates a subject with well-defined individuality; the wider the separation the more marked is the self-reliance and the consequent individuality. Always regard this marking as requiring care, for the owner is an unusual subject, and everything must be weighed in order to determine whether the self-reliance and self-esteem shown by the indications run to a danger point. The Line Of Head Part 3 248 No. 91. The Line Of Head Part 3 249 No. 92. The Line Of Head Part 3 250 No. 93. The Line Of Head Part 3 251 No. 94. It might be supposed that these separated lines would indicate lack of sensitiveness, as does an obtuse angle formed by the line starting low on the Life line, but such is not the case. In fact the opposite is true, for the separated Head and Life lines produce most sensitive people. They do not always show nor own it, but such is the case.</p>
<p>I have made up my mind, after having investigated a great deal in the endeavor to discover why this sign should indicate sensitiveness, that it is owing to pride, for the subject being extremely self-reliant, and confident of his own ability, allows his feelings to be hurt by anything which indicates that others have not the same degree of confidence in him that he has in himself. Sometimes the line of Head rises inside the line of Life on the lower Mount of Mars, and, after crossing the Life line, winds its way across the hand (94). This subject is extremely vacillating. He starts many things with enthusiasm and before he dies will have made innumerable changes. He is a shifter who constantly alters his opinions and does not continue in the same way of thinking long at a time. He is always intense in his views, makes most violent resolutions, and changes his mind with facility, but always with the same vigor. These subjects are rarely successful, for they do not stick to anything long enough to win. They are always aggressive, for the Head line rises from lower Mars, consequently they are frequently in trouble, always picking quarrels, and are avoided by those who do not want contention. The shifting mind and quarrelsome disposition are a poor combination, for one can never tell what tack these people may take next. If the color of the hand and lines be red, this will add to the unpleasantness of the indication, if yellow, the subject will be intolerably mean, in addition. The less mentality the hand indicates, the less will the subject be able to overcome the trouble, but good first phalanges to the fingers, a long second phalanx of thumb, with a long, narrow, or paddle-shaped first phalanx of that member, will give the subject forces with which he can largely counteract the shifting disposition indicated by such a Head line. Sometimes the Head line rises from the Mount of Jupiter (95). This line shows fine capability for leadership, a person who can handle men with ease and get the most out of them, one who is self-confident; and this source of the Head line is always an indication of strong mentality. There is diplomacy present which enables the subject to dictate without being harsh, to rule when he seems to be ruled, to appear dependent when he knows all depends on him; he is brainy, brilliant, and successful. Always note his type; if of a coarse make-up, the tact and diplomacy will disappear; he will lead but men will feel his strength. If the hand be fine, he will accomplish all he wishes, and men will not know how he does it. Sometimes the line will rise just at the base of the Mount of Jupiter (96), sometimes it will sweep clear up to the base of the finger, as in No. 95. Between these two sources are many degrees, and your estimate of the strength of the indication must be in proportion to its degree of marking on the Mount. Sometimes the line rises from the Life line but a branch rises to the Mount of Jupiter (97). This shows that ambition and the desire to be great or famous rule the subject. If the hand be purely a mental one, the subject&rsquo;s ambitions will be for mental fame.</p>
<p>If the hand be purely artistic, his ambitions will be for fame in that direction. If the hand be purely material, his ambition will be for riches. He will always strive to rise, and the life generally follows an upward grade. The Line Of Head Part 4 252 No. 95. The Line Of Head Part 4 253 No. 96. The course of the line through the hand is next to be considered. In cutting its way across the hand, the straighter the line runs (98), and the less it is changed in its course, the more fixed are the ideas of the subject, the more evenly is he balanced mentally, and the more practical and common-sense are his views. This line shows that he pursues an even course, and that outside influences have very little effect on him. He gauges everything by a practical standard and accepts what he chooses, allowing the balance to pass by without making much impression on him. The tendency or danger indicated by this line is that of becoming too unimpressionable, too inelastic, too sordid, to allow of adaptability. These subjects often do not make many friends, as they want everyone to come to their way of thinking. Everything is subjected to plain common-sense, often narrow views, and anything speculative or ideal is an abomination. This straight line must be the gauge by which you judge all deflections. When the line of Head rises on or under Jupiter, we have the qualities of that Mount exerting strong influence on the subject, and it is seldom that a line will be so placed that it can be deflected upward toward the Mount of Jupiter, but we do find the line deflected under the other Mounts. The line of Head normally curves upward slightly in the beginning of its course, and in most hands this curve is about midway between Jupiter and Saturn. The Line Of Head Part 4 254 No. 97. The Line Of Head Part 4 255 No. 98. When the line so perceptibly curves under Saturn (99) that its course is greatly changed, it shows that the subject is strongly tinged with Saturnian ideas. Often when every other method of classifying your subject into his proper type has failed, the Head line deflected toward a Mount will do it for you. The greater the deflection of the line toward Saturn the more surely will Saturnian ideas be strong in the subject.</p>
<p>You must note the character of the hand with this marking; if the mental world rules, then your client will love the study and research for which the Saturnian is famous; if the middle world rules, he will love farming, mining, and horticulture; if the lower world rules, his ideas will run toward the saving of money. If the line is deflected toward Apollo (100), the subject&rsquo;s mind will run in Apollonian channels. If the upper world rules, it will be art, pure and simple; if the middle world is stronger, money-making and love of beauty will be combined; if the lower world dominates, love of display, and a coarser love of the artistic will be indicated. The larger the deflection the greater is the degree of influence exerted by Apollo, and this is true of all deflections. When the line is deflected toward Mercury (101) it shows that Mercurian ideas are strong. If the upper world rules, fine powers of expression, persuasive force, even oratorical power, are indicated. The kind will be shown by the shape of the finger-tips. If the middle world is strongest, the mind will lean toward scientific investigations and the subject will be a good physician, teacher, or lawyer. If the lower world rules, money-making talent is strongly indicated. With a deflection toward this Mount, watch the crooking and twisting of the finger, to determine how much added shrewdness is present, and how near the subject is to roguery. If the line is wavy from source to termination (102) it will show that the subject has had no permanent fixedness of ideas. The variations which may occur in this wavy line are infinite, but by following the line from its beginning you can tell the age when each mental variation occurs and in what direction it tends. This reading of the line by sections will give the mental changes in detail. The Line Of Head Part 4 256 No. 99. The Line Of Head Part 4 257 No. 100.</p>
<p>The Line Of Head Part 4 258 No. 101. The Line Of Head Part 4 259 No. 102. The general interpretation which must be applied to a wavy line is a lack of continuous mental effort in any one direction, changeability of purpose, and consequent vacillation. Such a Head line is never self-reliant. As counsellors and advisers these people are not safe, for their opinions are not long the same. It is an unstable line, and shows unstable ideas. The line is often seen deflecting upward in a curve which may take it close to the line of Heart (103). This will show that the heart is a stronger factor than the head, and that sentiment will largely influence the subject. If the deflection of the Head toward the Heart line begins early in the line, and continues to the end, it will show that the heart was always the strongest, even from the beginning of life. If the deflection occurs later, this condition began later. If the deflection is slight, the heart will influence but not entirely rule the subject; if it is very great the heart will largely dictate. It is necessary with this indication to note which line is the deeper and stronger. If the Heart line, then sentiment will guide and reason will give way. If the Head, then reason will assert itself, often producing mental distress because the dictates of the heart cannot be followed. The Line Of Head Part 4 260 No. 103. Sometimes the line is found deflecting downward (104). The straight Head line marks the medium or nearest normal condition, and, generally speaking, all rising deflections come from an uplifting force, and conversely all downward deflections come from a downward influence. Consequently when the line of Head is seen to deflect downward, we feel that the mental attitude of the subject has been lowered during the period covered by this deflection. As the straight Head line shows the operation of a practical mentality, the downward deflection shows that a departure from the practical lines of thought occurs during the deflection, at what age can be read on the line. The Mount of Moon, the seat of imagination, being set at the base of the hand, is considered as the attracting power which causes the Head line to start downward. I have observed in the hands of many spiritists and of persons strongly impressed with psychic phenomena that the period at which these matters began to greatly interest them could be determined by a downward deflection of the Head line. If the deflection is short, the subject is for a time pulled in that direction, hut the line coming back to the straight course again shows that the ideas have been drawn back into the practical line again. If the deflection covers the whole line (105), there has been conflict between practical ideas and a desire to indulge in imaginative things, but as the line at the end gets back to the straight position, the inference is that practical ideas have conquered. When the line is deflected downward under a Mount (as in 104) the qualities of that Mount have impelled the subject to such thoughts as are indicated by the downward deflection. The three worlds will tell which side of the type qualities, mental, money-making, or baser, have caused the mental change. The Line Of Head Part 5 261 No. 104. The Line Of Head Part 5 262 No. 106. The Line Of Head Part 5 263 No. 106. The Line Of Head Part 5 264 No. 107. With all deflections note the character of the line before, during, and after a deflection and this will show the outcome. If a line is found deep and well cut before, thin during, and chained after (106), it will show that a vigorous mind (before) became less vigorous (during) and was impaired (after), the ages to be read from the line. If the line is thin at the start, chained during deflection, and ends in a star (107), the subject has a weak mind to start with, which was impaired by whatever caused the deflection, and ends in an explosion, as shown by the star. This will show either insanity or death; look to Life line, nails, color, type, etc., to determine which. These illustrations are only two out of the infinite number of combinations which may be found, and are given simply in order to show the method of reasoning. The source of the line shows the starting of the mental activity, the course through the hand indicates the changes which have affected it, and the termination shows the ultimate outcome. If the line be short, either the mentality is not great, or the termination of it comes early in life, by death or loss of mind. This matter has been treated under the head of &quot; Length of the Line,&quot; and will not be reconsidered here. When the line is very short and turns upward toward Saturn (108) the mental attitude of the subject will be Saturniaa, and a health defect of Saturn will cause early death. As we are considering the Head line, this health defect must apply to something affecting the head, which is manifestly the brain.</p>
<p>Paralysis being a prominent defect of the Saturnian will be the cause to which you may ascribe the end. Nails fluted, turning back, or brittle, yellow color, and many chance lines in the hand, a thin Life line, chained, islanded, broken, or otherwise defective, will enable you to confirm the indication. Older palmists gave to this line the reading &quot; sudden death,&quot; the reason for this must be apparent. If this line runs up on to the Mount of Saturn (109), the indication is doubly sure. If it ends in a star, a cross, or a dot (110), the sudden termination of the mentality and the life is assured. If the line ends in a tassel (111), paralysis followed by paresis is indicated, as the tassel shows the gradual dissipation and diffusion of the mental powers and not the sudden shock and catastrophe which the cross, the dot, or the star portend. The Line Of Head Part 5 265 No. 108. The Line Of Head Part 5 266 No. 109. The Line Of Head Part 5 267 No. 110. The older palmists ascribed grave results to all indications in which Saturn was concerned. This was because of the serious disorders peculiar to the Saturnian. When the line of Head turns up toward Apollo (112) it shows that the subject is strong in Apollonian ideas. The world which rules in each case will determine to which side of the type the ideas lean. In all of these cases where the Head line turns up toward a Mount it is an indication that the mental stamina is not especially strong. If it were, the subject might belong to a type, might be strong in his love of all things peculiar to the type, and yet would not lose self-control, or allow the typical Mount qualities to entirely dominate him, as must be the case when the line of Head is pulled out of its course and toward a Mount. When the line is drawn upward, but is not long enough to reach the Mount, heart or sentiment are stronger than head, and the subject has allowed a mere love of the things peculiar to some particular type to dominate him instead of reason. In other words, his head has been overcome by his feelings. When the Head line rises and is merged in the Heart line (113) it shows that the subject allows his feelings to overcome his judgment. This has been used by some palmists as indicating criminality. The Line Of Head Part 5 268 No. 111. The Line Of Head Part 5 269 No. 112. The Line Of Head Part 5 270 No. 113. It is not per se an indication of such tendencies. It does show that when the emotions, the sentiments, the feelings, the desires, or whatever it may be are aroused, that the subject will lose self-control and often commit crime in response to the appeal of his passions. He is not necessarily criminal, though he may be weak. Viewed in this light, if the hand be brutal, Mount of Venus large, full, and red, with Heart line deep and red, nails short, Mounts of Mars large, you will have one, who to satisfy his desires would become criminal and even commit murder. His head will not be strong enough to control the passions which rage within him. If the line cut clear up into Apollo (114), the cutting of the Heart line under Apollo by the Head line, will indicate a complication of the heart difficulty of the Apollonian, and some disorder in the mental health, most probably apoplexy. Note the Mount of Jupiter, color of hands, lines, nails, and all other-indications which may throw light on the subject. If at the point where the two lines cross they are deep cut and red, the danger will be serious. If at this point there is a star (115) the danger is very grave, for the explosion is most likely. If this marking is followed by an island (116), the shock will permanently weaken the mind, and at the least brain fever is indicated. If the line of Head turns toward Mercury (117), it will show how strongly the Mercurian qualities attract the subject. No matter what side of the Mercurian is developed, there will be a love of and talent for money-making. So strong is this desire for money that the subject will ruin his health or make any sacrifice to obtain it. As employers these people are tyrannical and exacting, they desire to make &ldquo;every edge cut&rdquo; and will work employees just as long as they can, and give them the least possible material with which to do the work. They love bargains, and will go miles to save a few pennies. Everything is measured by its money value. The Line Of Head Part 6 271 No. 114. The Line Of Head Part 6 272 No. 115. The Line Of Head Part 6 273 No. 116. When this line is seen, note carefully the type of the subject. If he be a bad or mean Saturnian, the combination of this type with the Head line rising to Mercury is distressing. If he be a crooked Mercurian you know that honestly or dishonestly, as may be necessary, he will have money. The crooked and twisted finger, with short nails should cause you to make your estimate strong, and if no Heart line is seen you know that the subject will stop at nothing. If you find this line on a good hand read it merely as the love of money. If with it the Medical Stigmata is present (118), which indicates the especial aptitude for medicine, you will have the money-making physician, if with this line the third phalanx of the finger is longest the money-making business man. No matter what the combination, the money side is strong. If the line goes clear up into the Mount (119), it will be in addition a health warning. The bilious tendency, the stomach disorder, and the nervousness, always present, will affect the head and produce vertigo, though serious results are not often encountered from the indication per se. The time period of the line when it has reached this point is about seventy and at that time the end is naturally not far distant. If the line should end in a star (120), sudden death is indicated. When the line runs into the upper Mount of Mars (121) it shows that practical common-sense ideas prevail. It is the medium position and the mental qualities are not pulled out of their balance. If upper Mars be well developed, it will give its qualities to the subject, who will defend himself when attacked, will be cool, calm, brave, and warlike in spirit. If the Mount be deficient, the mentality will partake of these deficiencies in Martian qualities and the subject will be easily discouraged, unable to resist strong attacks, and lacking in confidence. Whatever would be attributed to the Mount, attribute to the line. But whatever these attributes may be, the line ending here always gives practical ideas about everything. In very many bands the Head line slopes more or less toward the Mount of the Moon (122). This sloping of the line shows that the subject is somewhat influenced by imagination and is not practical to the exclusion of everything else. The Line Of Head Part 6 274 No. 117. The Line Of Head Part 6 275 No. 118. The Line Of Head Part 6 276 No. 119. There is a great misconception prevalent concerning this sloping Head line, which has been used as indicating danger of insanity. Nothing can be farther from the truth, for such a Head line is found on the hands of most sensible, self-contained, practical persons. Because one has the ability to imagine does not mean that he is insane or likely to be, neither does it follow that he is unpractical, so, if the line of Head be good, deep, well cut, and clear, little concern need be felt because it inclines toward the Mount of Moon. With this indication, as with all others, excess may make it bad.&rsquo; Other combinations with the line, or the character of the line itself, may spoil it, but the general proposition is, the line running toward the Moon shows that the subject is not entirely material in his ideas, but has the power of imagination. This is an essential qualification for writers, speakers, and linguists, and in the most successful men of these professions I find all degrees of droop to the Head line, some going far down into the Mount, and these persons have ability as writers of fiction and poetry (123). A line to reach the Moon must be a long one, so there is in these cases no lack of mentality. The Line Of Head Part 6 277 No. 120. The Line Of Head Part 6 278 No. 121. The Line Of Head Part 6 279 No. 122. A CELEBRATED AUTHOR No. 123. A CELEBRATED AUTHOR. It is only when the drooping line is seen on a poor type of subject or when it is thin or defective that it is unfavorable. As excess of imagination is one species of insanity; the drooping Head line with other unfavorable signs will clearly indicate mental derangement. If the line droops low on the Mount and ends in a star (124), it will indicate insanity. Drooping to the Moon and ending in a chain (125), it will tell of mental impairment. If it droops to the Moon and ends in a cross (126), it will indicate a check to the mentality. If it droops and ends in an island (127) or a dot (128), there is danger of mental disturbance. In these cases the size of the island or dot will tell how serious. If on the Mount of Moon the line is broken (129) and intermittent, it is another indication of mental disturbance. These markings of the line are more dangerous because the line droops to the Moon, the imaginative tendencies of the Mount making it a fertile place for such trouble. In every case the curve toward the Moon must be carefully considered. If it begins to droop from the start of the line (130), the tendency of the ideas have always been in that direction. If the line runs straight during the first part of its course and then slopes downward (131), the practical plane at the beginning is changed to a tendency toward imaginative ideas later in life, the date to be read from the point where the droop begins. Such violent changes or markings are not the best ones with this line; it is when the line forms a graceful curve, and gradually tends downward that no bad results follow. Sometimes the line forks at the end (132). This will indicate versatility, a union of practical and imaginative ideas which make the subject see things from a double point of view. I have seen this marking on the hands of successful theatrical people, and those who successfully appeal to the public in other ways. If the fork be slight, it must be read simply as versatility. If it be more marked, as in No. 133, it shows that the subject has a strong practical set of ideas and a strong set of imaginative ones. He can see things from both the practical and fanciful sides, and with this double point of view, he is less inclined to be narrow and one-sided. By noting which of the two forks is deeper and stronger, you can tell which side (practical or imaginative) will obtain the mastery. The Line Of Head Part 7 281 No. 124.

The double line, however, with its double point of view, often leads a subject into the habit of falsifying. He is not always an intentional liar; often he is not sure whether he is telling the literal story or the imaginative one. His imagination is vivid, and he sometimes makes himself think he is telling the truth when he is not. Prom the forking Head line is produced the liar, and when seen on an otherwise bad hand, it will make you sure of this interpretation. In habitual liars, I have found the forking Head line always present. Sometimes they lie from pride or vanity, for mercenary or vicious ends, and in each case the forking Head line will be seen. This applies to habitual falsifiers, not mere occasional &ldquo;story tellers.&rdquo; If the line has a fork with one line running to upper Mars and one going low on to the Moon, with this fork again forking (134), it will show that the double-pointed imagination, shown by the forked fork on the Moon, will be so vivid that the subject will &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; everything and will lie when the truth is better. He possesses such an enlarged imagination that he magnifies everything to double the original size, and all descriptions show this distortion. If the fork on the Moon ends in a star, a cross, or a dot (135), it will be practically certain that the enlarged imagination will produce insanity from, first, over-imagination; second, mental disease shown by the star, cross, or dot. In the two cases above mentioned, if the Mount of Moon be grilled and much rayed, it will add to the force of the indication all of the restlessness of the Lunarian. It will emphasize every bad indication found on a much drooped and forked line of Head. By keeping constantly in mind what constitutes a clear line of Head and what makes it defective, you can distinguish between a good, healthy imagination and mental disorder, and you will never tell a fine writer that he is going crazy. The Line Of Head Part 7 290 No. 133. The Line Of Head Part 7 291 No. 184. The Line Of Head Part 7 292 No. 136. Sometimes a line of Head divides into three well-cut forks, one going toward Mercury, one toward Mars, and one toward the Moon (136). This is a splendid marking, showing great diversity of intellect, adaptability, and versatility. In this case the three terminations unite business (Mercury), resistance (upper Mars), and imagination (the Moon). This combination generally produces a successful career, and unless laziness, lack of ambition, or some other defect is very strongly marked, a subject with this triple-forked termination will achieve much. In rare cases the Head line curves around and ends on the Mount of Venus (137). This will indicate that Venusian ideas of attraction are uppermost in the mind of the subject. This line is long, so there is plenty of mentality, and if it be deep and clear it is not per se an indication of defective mental health, but it shows the drawing, attracting power of Venus. The Line Of Head Part 7 293 No. 136. The Line Of Head Part 7 294 No. 187. The character of the Head line, which will next be considered, shows what strength there is to the mental qualities, and what ability to concentrate the mind. A deep and well cut line shows great mental power, good self-control, fixedness of purpose, good memory, and general mental health and strength. There is in this case a good clear channel for the Current to flow through, consequently the ideas run evenly and smoothly - no breaks, no jars, but steadiness and strength. The deep and well cut Head line shows one who is self-contained, does not &ldquo;lose his head,&rdquo; is not flighty or erratic, but is dignified, even-tempered, evenly balanced, and has the ability to make and carry out his determinations. If the long Head line be deep and well cut, its length shows great mentality and its depth shows strength of this quality. Long Head lines are often broken or defective while the subjects are very bright. From this you may think that a deep and well cut line is not necessary to produce mental stamina. But close analysis will show that while your subject is bright and has much mentality it is not the steady, deep, and strong kind, but is unstable. The length of the line shows the quantity, the depth and clearness shows the quality. Owners of deep, well cut Head lines do not always make up their minds as quickly, but weigh and consider carefully. Once reaching a decision, subjects with such a Head line are firm in execution; they can concentrate their ideas, pursue a single aim in life, and bring to bear on this aim a fund of strength and information drawn from many sources. They are cool in moments of danger, collected, not easily thrown off their guard, and possess self-control in the greatest degree. A strong thumb added to a deep and well cut Head line will make the subject firm, cool, and irresistible. The large thumb indicates the will which dominates others, the deep and well cut Head line shows the will which can control self. Give a subject both a large thumb and deep and well cut Head line, and he can accomplish almost any task if he sets out to do it. Observe the proportion of the lines to each other and also the size of the hand. If the Head line be deeper and clearer than the other lines, then the subject is a mental specimen of whatever type he belongs to, and his first phalanges will corroborate this. If the hand and the lines in general are small, but the Head line is deep and well cut, it is a grave danger, for it indicates more mental power than the subject has physical strength to carry easily. I have noted a number of incurable cases of insanity with this marking, and also that the Head line was deep red in color. So while the deep and well cut Head line, other things being equal, is the best marking, in excess it is one of the worst. The deep line shows excellent physical health of the brain, and with such a normal line you rarely find headaches, or any trouble from brain disorders. It is only when the line is seen in excessive development and red that you should fear trouble, and then vertigo, fainting spells, and, in extreme cases, apoplexy or insanity are indicated. This is more certain if your subject is a Jupiterian, especially if the third phalanx of the finger of Jupiter be thick. The strong Head line shows the capacity of the brain to think and do work; it shows a healthy brain, consequently one which can stand much exertion, and can also do better work than a weak or unhealthy organ. It is less swayed by others, more reliable, and in every way stronger. Take the deep and well cut Head line as the basis for best results in estimating a subject.</p>
<p>There are many hands in which the Head line is thin and narrow, and traces itself delicately across the hand. This thin line shows that the brain power is not vigorous, but that the subject is mentally delicate. He may be clever, and will be if the line is long, but will lack mental vigor. He will have good ideas but will be easily talked out of them, nor will he make great mental exertion, for it tires him. He cannot put his brain at work for any length of time, for it becomes weary. He cannot pass through trials without headaches, and, whenever possible, he avoids severe mental tension and great brain effort. He does not like to concentrate his mind, and cannot do so for any length of time. He has little self-control, but gives way to his feelings, either temper, low appetites, laziness, or whatever they may be. This thin line shows mental inertia, a lack of desire and ability to operate with vigor, lack of firmness, aggression, and of strong mental concentration. Its owner never does great things requiring continued mental exertion, but he does bright things which come to him by intuition and which do not require much brain exertion. It is dangerous to overcrowd these thin Head lines, for they cannot stand it. The channel is not deep enough to carry a large Current, and if such a Current is forced into it the thin line will give way and break. Here again observe proportion. If the hand and lines are large and the Head line thin, greatest care must be used. No mental over-excitement must be allowed, no loss of sleep, no narcotics, no stimulants, no excess of any kind. The subject must care for the stomach, and when fatigued must rest; any other sort of living will produce mental disorders. With these thin lines on the hands of men who make great mental exertions, you will often see places where the line cuts much more deeply than in others (138). These deep cuts show times at which the pressure has been too great and, at such a time, if the pressure is continued the brain will collapse, producing paralysis or nervous prostration. The age at which these strains occur can be read on the line. The Line Of Head Part 8 295 No. 138. Such markings will often be seen on the hands of active business or professional men, and the warning to &ldquo;ease up&rdquo; must always be given. By noting these variations in depth of the line, you can tell the years of best brain power, age to be read from the line. Stars, crosses, and dots (139) on a thin line will show dangers to the mental life that must not go unheeded. They show that explosions or checks will occur unless care be used, as well as the time, by the age at which they are seen. Cuts of the line show danger points.</p>
<p>If small and frequent (140) they indicate headaches; if deep, and the Head line thin (141), they show brain fever, nervous prostration, or paralysis. In all examinations look at both hands. If the Head line be deep in the left hand and thin in the right the natural brain power is strong, but has been weakened and it is dangerous to make great mental exertion. These subjects seldom heed warnings, for the natural brain strength, coming from the deep line in the left hand, cannot easily accommodate itself to the diminished quantity that is shown in the right hand. If the thin line be seen in the left hand and a deep line in the right, the brain vigor has increased and the subject can stand additional mental effort. I believe that weak mentality can be made strong without peril by gradual cultivation =  the danger point always comes from spasmodic and violent efforts. All of the changes from good to bad, strong to weak, or vice versa, can be read with accuracy by using the two hands. The Line Of Head Part 9 296 No. 139. The Line Of Head Part 9 297 No. 140. The broad and shallow Head line (142) is not an indication of vigorous mentality. The Current has too broad and shallow a channel and flows in a weak and shallow stream. It is not a vigorous brain but a weakened one, liable to aches and deterioration. The subject with this Head line is not firm, resolute, and courageous, but is undetermined, vacillating, uncertain, and lacks self-reliance and boldness. He may be bright, if the line is long, but he is weak in mental aggression. The broad and shallow line shows a lack of force or intensity in the mental attitude, the subject is not self-assertive; or, if possessed of a large thumb, he may be this, and yet lack real self-assertion; what he does show being merely a veneer. He has poor control of himself, small power to influence others, little concentration of mind, and poor memory. This subject is easily influenced and yields to temptations. He was not intended for mental occupations and does not often seek them. He is mentally lazy and does but little thinking, is satisfied to have others think for him, so does not create much stir in the world. If broad and shallow lines be seen in both hands your subject will continue in his weak way until the end of life. If the line improves and gets clear in the right hand you are safe in saying that the natural mental inertia will be replaced by as much more strength as the line in the right hand shows itself deeper and clearer cut than the one in the left. If a broad and shallow line be seen in the left hand and splits up and breaks to pieces in the right, the subject is utterly vacillating and hopelessly weak. With any subject a fine Head line may pull him out of the worst places, and subjects whose hands are seen to be wofully lacking in many desirable qualities may overcome their weakness if a strong mental structure is back of them. A broad and shallow line will weaken any hand no matter how strong in other respects, and make the results of what might be an otherwise successful life negative. It reduces the strength of strong Mounts. The Jupiterian ambition is diminished, the Martian vigor is greatly weakened, and every Mount feels the blight of mental laziness.</p>
<p>In many hands the line runs broad and shallow during the earlier years of life and then becomes deep and clear (143).</p>
<p>The age at which this change occurs will show the time at which the subject energetically took up life&rsquo;s battle, and really began to think for himself. This marking is often seen in the hands of women who have been &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; and who have never had to do anything until suddenly thrown upon their own resources, when they have had to take up life&rsquo;s struggle in earnest, and the Head line changes and grows deeper, clearer and straighter as they rise to the occasion and develop strength.</p>
<p>The chained Head line (144) is a bad indication. The channel is not only broad and shallow, but is continually obstructed. The mentality is weak and labored, utterly lacking in power of concentration, vacillating, timid, sensitive, and changeable.</p>
<p>You cannot rely on the promises of these subjects. They do not mean to break faith but they do so. They have poor memories, poor judgment, are continually subject to headaches and various mental disorders.</p>
<p>They cannot apply themselves continuously to any kind of work, either mental or manual.</p>
<p>If the Heart line is strong, they will be ruled by sentiment and utterly unpractical.</p>
<p>If the thumb is weak, they will be unable to think out a plan or to execute it.</p>
<p>To such subjects any mental shock is exceedingly dangerous and likely to throw them off their balance.</p>
<p>This done they have not the power to recover it. They are prone to delusions and hallucinations, chimerical and impractical in their ideas, and such a Head line drooping to the Moon produces phantasms, over-imagination, or insanity, and the person having such a line cannot be trusted to deal safely with speculative matters.</p>
<p>A subject with a chained Head line should not attempt mental vocations, should not choose literature, scientific studies, or any brain-exerting occupations, but should take out-of-door positions where labor with the hands or legs is required.</p>
<p>He should have a firm master under whom to work, for he will not be able to direct his own efforts, but will rely on being directed. If the chain appears in only a portion of the Head line, its weakening effect will apply only to the portion of the line it covers.</p>
<p>If it is replaced by a deep, well cut line (145) the subject will develop mental weakness into mental vigor.</p>
<p>It is not frequent that the chained condition is at once replaced by a deep line, for the change from such opposite mental conditions comes slowly, and in most cases the chained line is followed by a thin line which gradually grows stronger (146), showing the gradual progress from mental weakness to strength. Look to both hands for the outcome when a chained Head line is seen.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If it grows clear in the right hand your subject will gain mental strength. If it goes from a deep line in the left to a chained line in the right, the subject is going from a strong condition to a weak one. The Life line will show the effect, and the age at which this deterioration begins can be read from the Head line, and confirmed on the Life line.</p>
<p>You will find the different character of lines marked in great variety on Head lines. If you remember the kind of mental strength each one indicates, you know that each kind of a line will operate in the manner peculiar to its character during the period it covers on the line, and that when the character of the line changes, the mental view and qualities change at the same time.</p>
<p>The color of the Head line must always be noted.</p>
<p>White color will show poor blood supply to the brain and consequent weak operation of that organ. This color is most often seen on the broad and shallow or chained lines, and it adds to the poor indication of these lines, making them weaker. Pink color gives better force and takes away some of the weakness. Red color makes them more intense and less liable to absolute weakness ; but red color will make broad and shallow and chained lines violent and spasmodic in their action.</p>
<p>Thus, for periods they show great force, but the effort is only temporary and has no lasting quality.</p>
<p>These subjects often deceive even close observers by displays of mental vigor, but they do not deceive those who are familiar with the cause. Yellow color in a broad and shallow or chained line will make the subject, in addition to the weak mental operation, cross, nervous, despondent, and fault-finding.</p>
<p>The meanness of disposition which yellow color also gives is present if the line is pronouncedly yellow, and with this combination you have a weak and mean head combined.</p>
<p>Blue color shows congested circulation in the brain, and while it is per se a heart indication, it shows that the mentality may be cut off at any moment by a sudden heart failure.</p>
<p>In deep and well cut lines, white color is not often seen, but when the line on pressure does not show the red blood flowing along it, but remains white, it is an indication of coldness which must be added to the strong operation of the good line. The owner of this brain is calculating, cold, avaricious, and seeks self-aggrandizement at the expense of others. As this deep line shows great determination and strength of mind, the white coldness also seen in it indicates one who has little sympathy or feeling for others, and such a subject easily becomes the master and the tyrant, whether in home or business. The deep white line shows the strong, cold head.</p>
<p>Pink color is often seen in all kinds of lines and gives its added strength to the deep line. The subject with this combination has a vigorous, healthy brain and a strong mentality. His danger is from overwork. Red color often means excess with a deep Head line, and it results in mentally unbalancing the subject.</p>
<p>Too much brain and too much blood in it are the indications of this combination, and apoplexy, fainting fits, and insanity follow. Always regard red color in a deep Head line as a menace, and look over all the band for the place it will make its danger felt. Yellow color adds its baleful qualities to the deep line and makes the subject strong of brain but mean. This will produce the really vicious subject who conspires against his fellow-men. With a thin line, white color makes it weaker than if it were pink, while red color adds much strength.</p>
<p>With the latter color the danger is that more force will be exerted than the thin line can stand and the subject will overstrain his brain. Yellow color in a thin line makes the subject narrow, little, mean, nervous, and unstable. On the Head line we encounter all the defects possible to lines, and have frequent calls made upon us to read these defects correctly.</p>
<p>The defects commonly seen on Head lines are uneven lines, splits, cross-bars, islands, dots, and breaks. These constitute specific defects or, as commonly known, single signs, which are common to broad and shallow or chained lines, but are not often encountered on deep or even thin lines.</p>
<p>These specific defects in the Head line show that the operation of the mental activity is not continuous, regular, and strong, for these defects have intervened, obstructing the flow of the Current and the operation of the brain. They show that periods of health occur, followed by periods of weakness or disease, and consequently that the mental powers have at times been interfered with.</p>
<p>How great these interferences are, or have been, may be judged by the size and importance of the defect. When they begin and how long they last may be judged by the duration of the defective condition of the line. The first defective condition which we will consider is the uneven line.</p>
<p>This is a line which is thin for awhile, then thick, then thin again, and following a like variation throughout its course (147). These alterations may occur frequently, or only once or twice in the whole line.</p>
<p>They show that the mentality of the subject changes, now weak for a period of years, then strong, then weak, then strong, as many changes being indicated as there are uneven places on the line.</p>
<p>At the time the deep lines occur there is no doubt that great concentration of thought takes place, and the pressure on the brain is very strong. If the Head line at the beginning be thin, class it as a thin line and the deep places are the periods when great pressures occur. This is a dangerous line, for at these deep places the thin line may be crowded too much.</p>
<p>These subjects alternate between enthusiasm and despair, are changeable, and not reliable counsellors or guides. If a star, cross, or dot occurs in the course of this uneven line, paralysis, apoplexy, or insanity will be indicated. The greatest care, plenty of sleep, and no excitement must be the advice given this subject.</p>
<p>On the Head line will be seen splits of an infinite variety of sizes, and running in many directions. As a general rule splits which rise from the line are better indications than those which fall from it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If these rising splits are small and frequent but not large enough to impair the line (148) they show that the subject is aspiring to rise and to improve and that he seeks all avenues for advancement, as is indicated by these splits rising under all the Mounts.</p>
<p>If these splits are large and long (149) they indicate that the head is influenced by too many things, making the subject vacillating.</p>
<p>Such a subject will never have the concentration of mind that a deep and well cut line gives. The thoughts wander too much, and if the Head line droops toward the Mount of the Moon, these subjects are day dreamers. If the splits drop below the line (150) it shows that the subject is easily discouraged, does not fight the battle of life with vigor, but is prone to say, &ldquo;lam unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such subjects start into every enterprise saying they know &quot; it will fail,&quot; and as they really believe this, it generally does. Older palmists read this indication as &quot; sorrows and disappointments,&quot; which is generally correct, for the reasons above stated.</p>
<p>Always give these subjects advice along the line of &quot; resisting more and not giving way so easily.&quot; A angle split rising under Jupiter (151) shows that ambitious thoughts 611 the mind of your subject, and that Jupiterian desires are his. The Line Of Head Part 11 305 No. 148. He wishes to rise and to achieve fame and notoriety. This is a mark of great ambition and pride if found with a large Mount of Jupiter. If a split rises under Saturu (152) it shows that the thoughts are Saturnian, and wisdom, soberness, studiousness, and other Saturnian attributes attract your subject.</p>
<p>These splits show the pulling force of some attraction which is not strong enough to deflect the entire line, but is powerful enough to split a part from it; thus they show the attracting force of the place to which the split goes. If in either of the above cases the split line should end in a star (153) it will show that success rewards these ambitions or desires. The same construction applies to all the other Mounts.</p>
<p>In these cases be certain that the line is a split from the line of Head and not a chance line cutting it as 154. By closely examining the point where the split leaves the Main line you can easily diagnose the indication as a split.</p>
<p>If a split line rises from the line of Head and runs to Apollo (155) it shows that He will also be more sympathetic and humane. If split lines rise from the line of Head and merge into the line of Heart the head has been powerfully guided by heart. Often these lines are seen cutting the line of Saturu (159); in this case sentiment has interfered with business success.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Cross-bars are lines which cut the Head line, sometimes only one being seen, and again the entire line is cut by them (160). They are short lines which have no particular beginning or ending, but are apparently just long enough to cut the line of Head.</p>
<p>They cannot be classed as chance lines, but must be distinguished as cross-bars. If these lines are deep, cutting the Head line sharply, and are also red, they indicate a brain disorder, may be fever, may be only headaches, the severity of the attack being proportionate to their depth and redness.</p>
<p>The age can be read from the line. If several of these deep bars cut the Head line there is predisposition to brain trouble, and with a Jupiterian subject this is a serious matter, for apoplexy may result. If these cross-bars are merely little fine lines which cross the Head line they show mental worries and predisposition to severe headaches, but do not go so far as brain fever.</p>
<p>They are generally seen on the hands of hyper-nervous persons. Islands on the line (161) show that at the time they occur the mental strength operates with diminished force. I have seen islands on the Head lines of many insane persons whose aberration lasted through the duration of the island.</p>
<p>I have seen them on the Head lines of those whose line of thought had been changed, and who confessed that during the period indicated by the island they felt that they were not mentally balanced. I have seen the islands at points on lines where brain fever has occurred, or where delirium has been produced by other fevers.</p>
<p>I have seen them also on the hands of many spirit mediums who said they were &ldquo;developed&rdquo; into mediums at the age when the island appeared. I have seen them on the hands of women who have suffered from female trouble until their reason has been affected. Many similar instances might be cited, all of which would lead to the statement that during the period covered by an island, the mind is not in full health and power, and that an island shows delicacy of the brain during the period covered by it, more or less pronounced according to the size of the defect. Islands have been much used as denoting herditary weakness or defects ; they sometimes do, but they are not per se an indicator of heredity.</p>
<p>They always show a defect in constitution during their presence, and if any undue excitement or mental strain is put on the subject during the period of life covered by an island on the Head line, his mind will undoubtedly be unbalanced. Islands on the Head line in 85%, of cases indicate that the mind will be disturbed during their presence.</p>
<p>If islands are deep cut and red, the trouble will be brain fever, or possibly it may be female trouble, delirium of typhoid or other fevers, hyper-nervousness, or severe mental strain, sometimes the embracing of a new religion, that will produce the loss of mental equilibrium.</p>
<p>In hands full of lines crossing in every direction it is safe to read islands as periods of mental unbalance. The subject who has hands free from lines - which shows him to be phlegmatic and without nervous strain - may avoid the danger by his naturally calm, even temper.</p>
<p>It is a danger, however, and a grave one, in every case when these islands are seen in the Head line. You can estimate the results by the character of the Head line before and after the island. If after it a star, a cross, a dot, or a severe break in the line be seen the subject will not avoid serious mental disorder. If the line be deep and well cut after an island the results are not likely to be so serious. Always note the color of an island in the Head line, and apply color qualities. Deep red is always an added danger to the indication.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This will show that the brain was forced too much, and this produced the mental disturbance shown by the island. Note chance lines which connect the island with some other part of the hand; these will often show that diseases peculiar to the Mount types have caused the island. These chance lines are very trustworthy if they run from grilles or crossbars on the Mounts to an island on the Head line. An island on the Head line under Saturn is seen in the hands of 90% of deaf mutes.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dots in the Head line (163) are acute brain disorders which are severe according to the size and color of the dot.</p>
<p>If small and white or pink the trouble is an illness, but not per se of grave import. If the dot be large and deep red or purple, the brain trouble indicated is severe and great care should be taken by the subject at the age it occurs. The character of the line following dots will tell the effect which the illness has on the head. If the line continues deep and well cut the effect is only temporary.</p>
<p>If the line grows thin (164) it shows that mental vigor has decreased. If the dot be followed by a chained line (165) it shows that the brain sickness has much impaired the mind, and unless the chain is very short and replaced by a deep line (166) the mind will never entirely recover from the injury. During the period covered by the dot and chain there will be some mental disturbance, and no attempt should be made to pursue usual vocations. White dots almost always tell of past brain illness, and when the dots are deep red or purple they will generally be found in advance of the present age of the subject.</p>
<p>Islands following a dot (167) show great delicacy of brain following a severe illness - the longer and larger the island the greater the delicacy and the longer its duration.</p>
<p>This is a grave indication. The subject will be greatly unbalanced after the illness.</p>
<p>A star or cross following a dot (168) will show the fatal termination of the illness which is indicated by the dot. This is read with as much certainty as if shown on the Life line.</p>
<p>An island following a dot and ending in a star (169) will show that a severe brain illness occurs at the age when the dot appears on the line, followed by a period of delicacy lasting as long as the island, and ending fatally at the age at which the star appears.</p>
<p>If the Head line runs on after the star (170) it will show insanity instead of the termination of life. Breaks in the line (171) show the interruption of the Current, its unsteady flow, producing irregular action and consequent lack of concentration, firmness, and self-control.</p>
<p>These breaks may be illnesses ; if so they will be corroborated by nails, Life line, and other indications of disease. They are often seen on the hands of flighty, nervous, changeable subjects, and there is illness present at each time the line breaks. The age at which all of these illnesses occur can be read from the line.</p>
<p>If the line is continually broken and ladder-like (172) it shows an utter lack of stability; the subject is fickle and shifting, has continuous headaches, poor health, visions, phantasms, and unless cared for by no. 168. someone else goes insane or borders on it from nervousness.</p>
<p>These subjects fly off on tangents, are always seeking for the unrealizable, and if pointed tips are present they are utterly unpractical and unreliable, especially if the Head line goes far into the Mount of Moon. With every break in the Head line note whether it is repaired by sister lines, by the overlapping ends, connecting bars, squares, or any other repair signs.</p>
<p>If so, the subject will have a mental jar at the time of the break which will be more or less severe according to the size of the break and to how well it is repaired.</p>
<p>If the end of the broken line turns toward any Mount, handle it as in the case of the split running to a Mount.</p>
<p>Wherever the broken end goes it will show the force which produced the break. Note the condition of the line after a break, and it will tell whether the break has permanently impaired the mental stamina, or whether it is overcome. Note all signs like stars, dots, crosses, or islands after a break, and they will tell of the result on the mental capacity of the subject.</p>
<p>By following the line from source to termination and noting every change that occurs you will have no trouble in handling any break encountered.</p>
<p>Stars found on the Head line (173) are always a danger.</p>
<p>The electric light on the Head line does not produce brilliancy, but explosion. This may mean a sudden collapse, apoplexy, or insanity. Study the type of your subject; if Jupiterian or Martian interpret the star as apoplexy ; if Sa-turnian or Lunarian, read it as paralysis or insanity.</p>
<p>Follow all the instructions given in diagnosing disease, and you will never be at a loss. Watch for chance lines to the star, which will help to tell the cause of it. In every case consider a star on the Head line a danger and seek its explanation. Crosses on the Head line are also dangerous, and if large and deep are nearly as much so as a star. They must be estimated in the same manner as stars.</p>
