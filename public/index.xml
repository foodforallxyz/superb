                <description>I SPRAINED my foot so badly in ascending Mayon volcano that I had to stay in the house for a month.
Under the circumstances, I was not sorry to find myself settled in a roomy and comfortable dwelling.
It was:
 on the banks of a small stream in the middle of a garden a lot of coffee, cacao, oranges, papayas, and banana trees despite the tall weeds around.  Several over-ripe berries had fallen to the ground.</description>

                <description>The history of coffee in the Philippines is very similar to that of cacao.
The plant thrives wonderfully, and its berry has so strongly marked a flavour that the worst Manila coffee commands as high a price as the best Java.
In spite of this, however, the amount of coffee produced in the Philippines is very insignificant, and, until lately, scarcely deserved mention.
According to the report of an Englishman in 1828, the coffee-plant was:</description>

                <description>When my ankle began to get better, my first excursion was to Legaspi, where some natives were giving a theatrical performance.
A Spanish political refugee directed the entertainment.
On each side of the stage, roofed in with palm leaves, ran covered galleries for the dignitaries of the place. The uncovered space between which was set apart for the common people. The performers had chosen a play taken from Persian history.</description>

During the whole time I was confined to the house at Darága, the weather was remarkably fine ; but unfortunately the bright days had come to an end by the time I was ready to make a start, for the north-east monsoon, the sure forerunner of rain in this part of the Archipelago, sets in in October. In spite, however, of the weather, I determined to make another attempt to ascend the mountain at Bulusán.</description>

                <description>The 2 provinces of Camarines form a long continent. Its principal frontage of shore facing to the north-east and to the south-west ; which is about 10 leagues broad in its middle. Its shores are indented by many deep bays.
From about the centre of its north-eastern shore there boldly projects the peninsula of Caramúan, connected with the mainland of Camarines by the isthmus of Ysaróg. The north-eastern portions of the two provinces contain a long range of volcanic hills; the southwestern principally consisted, as far as my investigations permitted me to discover, of chalk and coral reefs.</description>

                <description>The difference in the position of the priests to that of the Government officials is seen in their respective dwellings.
The casas reules of the priests are generally small, ugly, and frequently half-ruined habitations, are not suited to the dignity of the chief authority of the province.
The conrento, on the contrary, is almost always a roomy, imposing, and wellarranged building.
In former days, when governorships were sold to adventurers whose only care was to enrich themselves, the influence of the minister of religion was even greater than it is now.</description>

                <description>In an hour and a half after leaving Polángui we reached Bátu, a village on the north-western shore of the lake of the same name.
The inhabitants, particularly the women, struck me by their ugliness and want of cleanliness. Although they lived close to the lake, and drew their daily drinking water from it, they never appeared to use it for washing.
The streets of the village also were dirty and neglected.</description>

MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE BÍCOL INDIANS. On my second journey in Camarines, which I undertook in February, I went by water from Polangui, past Bátu, as far as Nága.
The Quináli, which runs into the south-eastern corner of the lake of Bátu, runs out again on the north side as the Bícol River, and flows in a north-westerly direction as far as the Bay of San Miguél.</description>

                <description>The details of domestic economy may be narrated as follows:
For cooking purposes
An earthen pot is used for cooking. It costs between 3 and 10 cuartos. When cooking rice, is closed firmly with a banana-leaf, so that the steam of a very small quantity of water is sufficient.
The poor have no other cooking utensil. Those better off have a few cast-iron pans and dishes.
In the smaller houses, the hearth consists of:</description>

                <description>Under certain conditions, which the physicians, on being questioned, could not define more precisely, the natives can support neither hunger nor thirst; of which fact I have on many occasions been a witness.
It is reported of them, when forced into such a situation as to suffer from unappeased wants, that they become critically ill; and thus they often die.
Hence arises the morbid mania for imitation, which is called in Java Sakit-latar, and here Mali-mali.</description>

                <description>From Nága I visited the cura of Libmánan (Ligmanan) who:
 had poetical talent and a reputation of a natural philosopher collected and named pretty beetles and shells dedicated the most elegant little sonnets.  He favoured me with the following narrative :
In 1851, during the construction of a road a little beyond Libmánan, at a place called Poro, a bed of shells was dug up under 4 feet of mould, 100 feet distant from the river.</description>

                <description>The following certificate translated by the interpreter of the German Consulate shows how highly ancient pots, even of native origin, are esteemed in Japan up to the present:
“This earthen vessel was found in the porcelain factory of Tschisuka in the province of Odori, in South Idzumi, and is an object belonging to the thousand graves . . . It was made by Giogiboosat (a celebrated Buddhist priest), and after it had been consecrated to heaven was buried by him.</description>

                <description>GOLD-WASHING Paracáli and Mambuláo are two localities well known to all mineralogists, from the red lead ore occurring there.
On the following morning I returned to Longos which only had a few miserable huts inhabited by gold-washers. They go about almost naked, probably because they work most of the day in the water and are also very poor.
The soil is composed of rubbish, decomposed fragments of crystalline rock, rich in broken pieces of quartz.</description>

I sent my baggage from Daét to Cabusáo in a schooner. I then proceeded on foot by the road to the coast on the west side of the Bay of San Miguél.
We crossed the mouth of the river in a boat, which the horses swam after ; but they were soon abandoned from unfitness. At the mouth of the next river, Sácavin, the water was so high that the bearers stripped themselves naked and carried the baggage over on their heads.</description>

                <description>THE YSARÓG AND ITS INHABITANTS. Tue Ysaróg (pronounced Issaró) rises up in the middle of Camarínes, between the bays of San Miguel and Lagonóy.
While its eastern slope almost reaches the sea, it is separated on its western side by a broad strip of inundated land from the Bay of San Miguél. In circumference it is at least twelve leagues; and its height 1,966 metres.* Very flat at its base, it swells gradually to 16°, and higher up to 21° of inclination, and extends itself, in its western aspect, into a flat dome-shaped summit.</description>

The chief of the Montesinos had received daily rations for 22 men, with whom he professed to make a road to the summit; but when, on the evening of the third day, he came himself to Yriga, in order to fetch more provisions, on the pretext that the work still required some time for execution, I explained that I should endeavour to ascend the mountain on the following morning, and requested him to act as guide.</description>

It was June in the middle of the so-called dry season. But it rained almost every day. The road between Albáy and Legaspi was worse than ever.
During my visit, information arrived from the commandant of the falúas on the south coast that, as he was pursuing 2 pirate vessels, 6 others suddenly made their appearance, in order to cut off his return; for which reason he had quickly made his way back.</description>

At the present time, each island has its separate governor.
The older authors called the island Tendaya, Ybabáo, and also Achan and Philippina.
In later times, the eastern side was called Ybabáo, and the western Samar, which is now the official denomination for the whole island, the eastern shore being distinguished as the Contracosta.</description>

In Guiuan, I was visited by some Micronesians. For the last 14 days, they had been in Sulangan on the small neck of land south-east from Guíuan, diving for pearl mussels (mother-of-pearl). They had sailed from Uleai (Uliai, 7° 20&rsquo; N., 143° 57&rsquo; E. Gr.) in five boats, each of which had a crew of 9 men and carried 40 gourds full of water, with cocoa-nuts and batata.</description>

                <description>Their chief idolatry consisted in the worship of those of their ancestors who had most distinguished themselves by courage and genius, whom they regarded as deities.
They called them humalagar, which is the same as manes in the Latin.
Even the aged died under this conceit, choosing particular places, such as one on the island of Leyté, which allowed of their being interred at the edge of the sea, in order that the mariners who crossed over might acknowledge them as deities, and pay &rsquo;them respect.</description>

                <description>In the environs of Basey, the Ignatius bean grows in remarkable abundance, as it also does in the south of Sámar and in some other of the Bisayan islands. It is not present in Luzon. But it is very likely that I have introduced it there unwittingly.
Its sphere of propagation is very limited. My attempts to transplant it to the Botanical Garden of Buitenzorg were fruitless.
Some large plants intended for that purpose, which during my absence arrived for me at Darága, were incorporated by one of my patrons into his own garden ; and some, which were collected by himself and brought to Manila, were afterwards lost.</description>

                <description>On the southern half of the eastern border, on the shore from Borongan by Láuang as far as Guíuan, there are considerable plantations of coconuts, which are most imperfectly applied to oil production.
From Borongan and its visitas, 12,000 pitchers of coconut oil are yearly exported to Manila. Those consumed by men and pigs would suffice for at least 8,000 pitchers.
As 1,000 coconuts yield 8 pitchers and a half. The vicinity of Borongan alone yields annually 6,000,000 coconuts.</description>

                <description>CROCODILES.
The island of Leyté is over 25 miles long and almost 12 miles wide. It is 170 square miles.
It is divided from Sámar only by the small strait of San Juanico.
The chief town, Taclóban, or Taclobang, lies at the eastern entrance of this strait. It has a very good harbour and uninterrupted communication with Manila. It is the chief emporium of trade to Leyté, Biliran, and South and East Sámar.</description>

                <description>The inhabitants of Sámar and Leyté (I have not become closely acquainted with any others) belong to one race.*
They are, physically and intellectually, in character, dress, manners and customs, so similar that my notes, which were originally made at different points of the two islands, have, after removal of the numerous repetitions, fused into one, which affords a more complete picture. It also shows their small differences. There are no negritos either in Sámar or Leyté, but many Cimarronese.</description>

Sometimes, after the harvest, it is 3 reals per caban. Before it, ten ; and in Albay, even about thirty reals. Then about three cuartos are wanted for extras (as fish, crabs, vegetables, etc.</description>

Amulets Every female native wears by a string round the neck with the image of the Virgin Mary. Many also have heathen amulets. I saw an amulet taken from a daring criminal.

Safety, not appearance, was the object of its builders. It reminds the beholder of a Spanish provincial town, and is, next to Goa, the oldest city in the Indies.</description>

But it has few uses. Because of its silky appearance, the natives call it the bandála seed.
In commerce, abacá is the plant where it comes from. It is a wild species of banana known also as Arbol de Cáñamo (hemp-tree), Musa textilis, Lin.
It looks like the edible banana tree (Musa paradisiaca), one of the most important plants of the torrid zone.</description>

I have still to speak of an important portion of the population, viz. the Chinese, who are destined to play a remarkable part, inasmuch as the development of the land-cultivation demanded by the increasing trade and commercial intercourse can be effected only by Chinese industry and perseverance.
Manila has always been a favourite place for Chinese immigrants; and neither the hostility of the people, nor oppressing and prohibitory decrees for a long time on the part of the Government, not even the repeated massacres, have been able to prevent their coming.</description>

Its roadstead, however, is very unsafe, and, being exposed to the northeasterly storms, is perfectly useless during the winter.
The northnorth-east wind is the prevailing one on this coast; the south-west breeze only blows in June and July. The heaviest storms occur between October and January.
They generally set in with a gentle westerly wind, accompanied with rain. The gale presently veers round to the north or the south, and attains the height of its fury when it reaches the north-east or the south-east.</description>

                <description>The Philippines was discovered by Magellan on March 16, 1521–St. Lazarus&rsquo;s day.* But it was not until 1564, after many previous efforts had miscarried, that Legaspi, who left New Spain with five ships, took possession of the Archipelago in the name of Philip II.
The discoverer had christened the islands after the sanctified Lazarus. This name, however, never grew into general use; the Spaniards persistently calling them the Western Islands—Islas del Poniente; and the Portuguese, Islas del Oriente.</description>

                <description>Manila lies 650 nautical miles south-east of Hongkong. A mail steamer can travel it in 3 to 4 days. This allows of a fortnightly postal communication between the Philippines and the rest of the world.
European mail reaches Manila through Singapore and Hong-Kong. Singapore is about equidistant from Hongkong and Manila. Letters therefore could be received at both ports at the same time if they were sent direct from Singapore.</description>

                <description>Manila is situated on both sides of the river Pasig. The town itself, surrounded with walls and ramparts, with its low tiled roofs and scattered towers. It appeared like some ancient European fortress.
On June 3, 1863 at 7:31pm an earthquake shook the preparations for the festival of Corpus Christi.
The firmest buildings reeled visibly, walls crumbled, and beams snapped in two. The dreadful shock lasted half a minute. But this little interval was enough to:</description>

                <description>Juan de Salcédo was the most illustrious of all the conquerors.
Supported by his grandfather, Legaspi, with 45 Spanish soldiers, he fitted out an expedition at his own expense, embarked at Manila in May 1572, examined all parts of the west coast of the island, landed in all the bays which were accessible to his light-draught ships, and was well received by the natives at most of the places.
He generally found great opposition in penetrating into the interior.</description>

These animals, which are of the size of the domestic cat, belong to the quadrumana ; but, like the flying squirrels, they are provided with a volucral membrane, which, commencing at the neck, and passing over the fore and hinder limbs, reaches to the tail; by means of which they are able to glide from one tree to another at a very obtuse angle.</description>

The natives of these beautiful islands have lived as comfortably during the last hundred years, protected from all external enemies and governed by mild laws, as those of any other tropical country under native or European sway.</description>

Manila was their chief market. It also attracted a great portion of the external Indian trade, which the Portuguese had frightened away from Malacca by their excessive cruelty.
The Portuguese still remained in Macao and the Moluccas. But they wanted those remittances which were almost exclusively sought after by the Chinese, viz.</description>

Across a marshy meadow we reached the base of the Malináo or Buhi mountain, the slippery clay of the lower slope merging higher up into volcanic sand. The damp undergrowth swarmed with small leeches; I never before met with them in such numbers.</description>

In Bátu the rice was only just planted. In Nábua, it already was almost ripe.
I was unable to obtain any explanation of this incongruity, and know not how to account for such a difference of climate between two hamlets situated in such close proximity to one another, and separated by no range of hills.</description>

                <description>The historical Maharlika implemented a democratic confederation system similar to the one implemented by the Greek city states, the European Hanseatic league, and the Swiss Confederacy. This is the opposite of the centralized imperial system imposed by the Romans, Arab Muslims, and the Chinese.
However, a confederation is weak against empires. The Greeks were easily gobbled up by the Romans, just as the North African tribes were swallowed up by the Arabs under Islam.</description>

                <description>A complete theory must corresponding to each element of reality. It can predict reality with certainty, without disturbing the system.
In quantum mechanics, in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other.
This means that either:
 The description of reality given by the quantum wave function is not complete or These two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality  Quantum mechanics makes predictions in one system based of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it.</description>

                <description>Two systems, I and II interact from the time t=0 to t=T. Afterwards, they stop interacting. Their states before t=0 were known.
Schrodinger&rsquo;s equation gets the state of the combined system I+II at any subsequent time. Let us designate the corresponding wave function by ..
But we cannot calculate the state in which either one of the two systems is left after the interaction.
This, according to quantum mechanics, can be done only through further measurements, by a process known as &ldquo;the reduction of the wave packet&rdquo;.</description>

 The production of vaccines is the domain of biotech which India, South Korea, and Singapore are good at. The production of PPEs, on the other hand, are done by manufacturing, which China, Taiwan, and even Vietnam excel in.</description>

                <description>By labour man drew his first wealth from the earth, but scarcely had he satisfied his primitive wants, when desire made him conceive other enjoyments, not to be obtained without the aid of his fellows. Exchanges began. They extended to whatever had any value, to whatever could produce any.
They comprised mutual services and labour, no less than the fruit of labour; and gave room to the formation and increase of a new kind of wealth, which was no longer measured by the wants of him who produced it, but by the wants of all those with whom he might transact exchanges, - with whom he might carry on commerce; and hence we have named it commercial wealth.</description>

                <description>Abstractly, the multiplication of food follows a geometrical progression like the multiplication of men. It follows it only much faster. In a given space and time, this progression is not followed any more by the one species than the other.
Population is arrested first, and arrests subsistence in its turn. When the obstacle is removed, both begin again to increase until they reach a new limit, equally common to both. The history of the universe has never yet presented the example of a country in which the multiplication of food could not be more rapid than that of the co-existent population.</description>

All that man values is created by his industry; all that he creates is destined to be consumed in satisfying his wants and desires. But, between the moment of its production by labour, and its consumption by enjoyment, the thing destined for man&rsquo;s use may have an existence more or less durable. It is this thing, this accumulated and still unconsumed fruit of labour, which is called wealth.</description>

But if, at the present day, some new discovery should enable us, by a single stocking-frame, to do the work which ten years ago was done by 100, this discovery would be a national misfortune; for the number of consumers can scarcely increase, and it would then be the number of producers which would be diminished.</description>

                <description>Wealth incessantly circulates from producers to consumers through money.
All kinds of exchange are accomplished under this form, whether the means of producing wealth are transmitted from one proprietor to another, or when land or movable capital changes its owner, or when labour is sold, or when the object destined to be consumed reaches the hands that are to use it.
Money facilitates all these exchanges. It occurs among the different contractors as a thing which all desire, and by means of which every one may find what he immediately requires; as a thing, moreover, submitted to invariable calculation, and by means of which all other values may be appreciated, this alone being their scale.</description>

But man is a complex being. He experiences moral and physical wants. Therefore his happiness has moral and physical aspects.
Moral Happiness The moral happiness of man, so far as it depends on his government, is intimately connected with the improvement of that government. It is the object of civil policy.</description>

They are the most necessary of all, because it is from the ground that our subsistence is derived; because they furnish the materials for every other kind of labour; and lastly, because, in preparation, they constantly employ the half, often much more than the half, of all the nation.
The class of people who cultivate the ground are particularly valuable for bodily qualities fitted to make excellent soldiers, and for mental qualities fitted to make good citizens.</description>

Siguiendo nuestra costumbre de abordar de frente las más árduas y delicadas cuestiones que se relacionan con Filipinas, sin importarnos nada las consecuencias que nuestra franqueza nos pudiera ocasionar, vamos en el presente artículo á tratar de su porvenir.
Para leer en el destino de los pueblos, es menester abrir el libro de su pasado.</description>

3 Las Filipinas, si han de continuar bajo el dominio de España, tienen por fuerza que tranformarse en sentido político, por exigirlo así la marcha de su historia y las necesidades de sus habitantes. Esto lo demostramos en el artículo anterior. Esta transformación, dijimos también, ha de ser violenta y fatal, si parte de las esferas del pueblo; pacífica y fecunda en resultados, si de las clases superiores.</description>

                <description>Motion in the most general sense, conceived as the mode of existence, the inherent attribute of matter, comprehends all changes and processes occurring in the universe, from mere change of place right up to thinking.
The theory of motion began as from the simplest change of place and the mechanics of heavenly bodies and terrestrial masses.
 It was followed by the theory of molecular motion, physics, and immediately afterwards, the science of the motion of atoms, chemistry.</description>

                <description>Basketball was invented in America by James Naismith as an indoor ball sports.
The problem is that it puts the goal above human height level. This makes it advantageous to tall races like Africans and Europeans. This deprives other shorter races of the chance to excel in the game. This lowers sports activity which could have improved health and teamwork.
To allow shorter races to excel in basketball, we propose &ldquo;bayongball&rdquo; which has the following rules:</description>

                <description>The general nature of dialectics to be developed is the science of interconnections, in contrast to metaphysics.
The laws of dialectics are abstracted, therefore, from:
 the history of nature and the history of human society.  These laws are nothing but the most general laws of these 2 aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.
They can be reduced to 3 developed by Hegel in his idealist fashion as mere laws of thought:</description>

                <description>Ampère’s immortal work is &ldquo;Théorie des phénomènes electro-dynamiques, uniquement fondée sur expérience&rdquo;.
He had made no hypotheses; but as we shall not be long in recognising, he was mistaken; only, of these hypotheses he was quite unaware.
On the other hand, his successors see them clearly enough, because their attention is at- tracted by the weak points in Ampère’s solution. They made fresh hypotheses, but this time deliberately. How many times they had to change them before they reached the classic system, which is perhaps even now not quite definitive, we shall see.</description>

                <description>Energetics The difficulties raised by the classical mechanics have led certain minds to prefer a new system which they call Energetics.
Energetics took its rise in consequence of the discovery of the principle of the con- servation of energy. Helmholtz gave it its definite form. We begin by defining two quantities which play a fun- damental part in this theory.
They are kinetic energy, or vis viva, and potential energy. Every change that the bodies of nature can undergo is regulated by two experimental laws.</description>

                <description>The principles of geometry are not experimental facts. Euclid’s postulate cannot be proved by experiment.  Think of a material circle, measure its radius and circumference, and see if the ratio of the two lengths is equal to π. What have we done?  We have made an experiment on the properties of the matter with which this roundness has been realised, and of which the measure we used is made.</description>

                <description>I have dwelt upon the consequences of Ampère’s theory and on his method of explain- ing the action of open currents. It is difficult to disregard the paradoxical and artificial character of the propositions to which we are thus led. We feel bound to think “it cannot be so.”
Helmholtz has been led to look for something else. He rejects the fundamental hypothesis of Ampère— the mutual electro-dynamics.
action of two elements of current reduces to a force along their join.</description>

                <description>PART IV. NATURE.
The Rôle of Experiment and Generalisation.—Exper- iment is the sole source of truth. It alone can teach us something new; it alone can give us certainty. These are two points that cannot be questioned. But then, if experiment is everything, what place is left for mathe- matical physics? What can experimental physics do with such an auxiliary—an auxiliary, moreover, which seems useless, and even may be dangerous? However, mathematical physics exists.</description>

MODERN natural science, which alone has achieved an all-round systematic and scientific development, as contrasted with the brilliant natural-philosophical intuitions of antiquity and the extremely important but sporadic discoveries of the Arabs, which for the most part vanished without results – this modern natural science dates, like all more recent history, from that mighty epoch which we Germans term the Reformation, from the national misfortune that overtook us at that time, and which the French term the Renaissance and the Italians the Cinquecento, although it is not fully expressed by any of these names.</description>

                <description>Continuum cannot be explained by geometry. The geometer always seeks to represent shapes. But these are only instruments to him. He uses space in his geometry just as he uses chalk.
Too much importance must not be attached to accidents which are often nothing more than the whiteness of the chalk.
The pure analyst has not to dread this pitfall. He has disengaged mathematics from all extraneous elements, and he is in a position to answer our question:—“Tell me exactly what this continuum is, about which mathematicians reason.</description>

                <description>Modern dialectics is split into 2 extremes.
One is based on natural science which, like the German philosophy of nature, tries to force the objective world into the framework of its subjective thought.
Another is based on mere experience. It disdains thought and prefers the extreme emptiness of thought. This school prevails in England.
Its father was Francis Bacon. He pushed the empirical-inductive method to attain:
   rejuvenation alteration of stature and features transformation of one body into another the production of new species power over the air the production of storms.</description>

Every conclusion presumes premises which are either:
 obvious, or can be established only if based on other propositions  We cannot go back in this way to infinity, every deductive science, and geometry in particular, must rest upon a certain number of indemonstrable axioms.
All treatises of geometry begin therefore with the enunciation of these axioms. But there is a distinction to be drawn between them. Some of these, for example, “Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another,” are not propositions in geometry but propositions in analysis.</description>

                <description>Fresnel’s Theory The best example that can be chosen is the theory of light and its relations to the theory of elec- tricity.
The science of optics is more advanced than any other branch of physics because of Fresnel.
The theory called the theory of undulations forms a complete whole. But we must not ask from it what it cannot give us. The object of mathematical theories is not to reveal to us the real nature of things; that would be an unreasonable claim.</description>

                <description>The Principle of Relative Motion Sometimes endeavours have been made to connect the law of acceleration with a more general principle. The movement of any sys- tem whatever ought to obey the same laws, whether it is referred to fixed axes or to the movable axes which are implied in uniform motion in a straight line. This is the principle of relative motion; it is imposed upon us for two reasons: the commonest experiment confirms it; the consideration of the contrary hypothesis is singularly repugnant to the mind.</description>

                <description>Let us begin with a little paradox. Beings whose minds were made as ours, and with senses like ours, but without any preliminary education, might receive from a suitably-chosen external world impressions which would lead them to construct a geometry other than that of Euclid, and to localise the phenomena of this external world in a non-Euclidean space, or even in space of four dimensions.
As for us, whose education has been made by our actual world, if we were suddenly transported into this new world, we should have no difficulty in referring phenom- ena to our Euclidean space.</description>

                <description>What has that calculus to do with physical science? The questions I shall raise—without, however, giving them a solution—are naturally raised by the philosopher who is examining the problems of physics. So far is this the case, that in the two preceding chapters I have several times used the words “probability” and “chance.”
“Predicted facts can only be probable.”
However solidly founded a prediction may appear to be, we are never absolutely certain that experiment will not prove it false; but the probability is often so great that practically it may be accepted.</description>

                <description>PART 3: FORCE
The English teach mechanics as an experimental science. Here on the Continent, it is taught always as a deductive and à priori science.
The English are right.
Why did the Continental scientists stay so long in theory?
On the other hand, if the principles of mechanics are only experimental, then they are merely approximate and provisory. It means we can have new experiments to modify or abandon them.</description>

                <description>Among these explicit axioms there is one which seems to me to deserve some attention, because when we abandon it we can construct a fourth geometry as coherent as those of Euclid, Lobatschewsky, and Riemann.
To prove that we can always draw a perpendicular at a point A to a straight line AB, we consider a straight line AC movable about the point A, and initially identical with the fixed straight line AB.</description>

The very possibility of mathematical science seems an insoluble contradiction.
If this science is only deductive in appearance, from whence is derived that perfect rigour which is challenged by none?
If, on the contrary, all its propositions can be derived by formal logic, how is it that mathematics is not reduced to a gigantic tautology?
The syllogism can teach us nothing essentially new. If everything must spring from the principle of identity, then everything should be capable of being reduced to that principle.</description>

Political economists assert that labour is the source of all wealth. And it really is the source – next to nature, which supplies it with the material that it converts into wealth.
But it is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that labour created man himself.</description>

                <description>The second eminent adept among English natural scientists is Mr. William Crookes. He discovered the chemical element thallium and the radiometer.
Mr. Crookes began to investigate spiritualistic manifestations about 1871. For this, he used physical and mechanical appliances, spring balances, electric batteries, etc.
Mr. Crookes was just as completely captivated as Mr. Wallace:
For some years, a young lady, Miss Florence Cook, has exhibited remarkable mediumship, which latterly culminated in the production of an entire female form purporting to be of spiritual origin, and which appeared barefooted and in white flowing robes while she lay entranced in dark clothing and securely bound in a cabinet or adjoining room.</description>

                <description>This is because all scientific research deals with ideas of the mind and the imagination.
This applies to the religious sciences in which research is mostly concerned with words and the substance of which is the laws derived from the Qur&rsquo;an, the Sunnah, and the language used in (both the Qur&rsquo;an and the Sunnah) that leads to (the formulation of) these (laws). These are all matters of the imagination.
The same fact also applies to the intellectual sciences, which are matters of the mind.</description>

                <description>A few hundred years ago, many of the desert regions in the world were full of trees and wildlife.
Due to tree felling by local people and commercial interests, and the depletion of the subterranean water, the deserts have spread.
Many problems occur with the disappearance of trees.
 The carbon dioxide content in the air rises as there are fewer plants to absorb the carbon dioxide which is constantly being expired into the atmosphere.</description>

                <description>For afforestation programmes to be successful, surface water must be conserved.
This can best be accomplished by:
 increasing the water capacity of existing storage systems building new systems.  The cheapest and easiest method of creating new water storage systems is to construct small-scale ponds and lakes.
Location of artificial ponds and lakes In the rainy season observe where the surface water flows – its currents and directions – and where the rivulets created from the rain water converge together.</description>

In many languages the words for food are synonymous with the words for rice or wheat, which signifies the importance of these crops to the people.
Rice is an older crop than wheat. Cereals can be divide into two sections – cereals and grasses.
Some important cereals include:
 rice (paddy). The varieties include: áus – early, áshu áman – haemantik, autumn, pre-winter boro – summer wheat barley maize (corn) oats rye millet (bájrá) Some grass seeds include:  chiná káun kheri nárkát́ia shyámá kada máruya There are other edible grass seeds grown in India, but they have little food value.</description>

                <description>CROP ROTATION In crop rotation, the soil is under cultivation for most of the year.
In the Purulia district of West Bengal, many farmers grow only one crop of paddy a year. Through crop rotation, 4 crops can be harvested in a year.
In the rainy season, no mixed crop can be grown with paddy, only small fish.
Autumn paddy can be combined with big onions, summer paddy with radish, and spring paddy with small onions grown from seeds.</description>

                <description>How many a prophet did We send to the ancients? No messenger came to them, but they ridiculed him. We destroyed people more powerful than they, and so the example of the ancients has passed away.   9  And if you asked them, “Who created the heavens and the earth?” They would say, “The Mighty, the Knower created them.”
 10  He who made the earth a habitat for you, and traced pathways for you on it, that you may be guided.</description>

So do what you want, and so will we.”

                <description>The binding of the perceiving consciousness to a certain region is attention (dharana).  Emerson quotes Sir Isaac Newton as saying that he made his great discoveries by intending his mind on them. That is what is meant here. I read the page of a book while inking of something else.
At the end of he page, I have no idea of what it is about, and read it again, still thinking of something else, with the same result.</description>

                <description>1  O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity, and calculate their term.
Be pious and do not evict them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven adultery.
These are the limits of Allah—whoever oversteps Allah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You never know; Allah may afterwards bring about a new situation.
 2  Once they have reached their term, either retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably.</description>

                <description>The 8 means of Yoga are:
  the Commandments
  the Rules
  right Poise
  right Control of the life-force
  Withdrawal
  Attention
  Meditation 8/ Contemplation.
  These eight means are to be followed in their order, in the sense which will immediately be made clear.
We can get a ready understanding of the first two by comparing them with the Commandments which must be obeyed by all good citizens, and the Rules which are laid on the members of religious orders.</description>

                <description>Primitive humans had no society. Their whole set-up was individualistic.
Even the concept of family was absent. Life was brute and non-intellectual.
Nature was the direct abode and physical strength ruled the day. The strong enjoyed at the cost of the weak, who had to surrender before the voracity of the physical giants.
However, the sense of acquisition had not developed in them, and they worked manually, and there was no intellectual exploitation in that age.</description>

                <description>In the distant past, large animals used to go to predetermined places to die. Wild elephants still have this habit.
At such places, with the passage of time the bones of the animals became deposits of calcium sulphate and calcium carbonate. Wherever cretaceous animals lived in groups, limestone will be found.
In Assam, for example, limestone and petroleum can be found.
The fat of these huge animals became petroleum and the bones became limestone.</description>

Some of the more common fibre crops are:
 linseed (tisi, mosne, chikaná) jute (pát). The varieties include: miit́há pát́ tiitá pát́ (Mestá pát́ is not actually jute.</description>

                <description>FLOWERS Flowers are grown for their beauty, fragrance, essential oil, medicinal value and floral nectar, and some flower seeds can be eaten, used in cooking or processed to produce oil. For example, flowering plants like night jasmine (shephali or Nyctanthes arbortristis) and ghandharaj can be grown for their fragrant flowers, while sunflower has edible seeds and can be grown as an oil crop or roadside plant.
Flowering trees such as bakphul (Sesbania grandifloria) can also be grown along roadsides or in beauty spots.</description>

                <description>5  Before them the people of Noah rejected the truth, as did the confederates after them. Every community plotted against their messenger, to capture him. And they argued with falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I seized them. What a punishment it was!
 Thus the sentence of your Lord became realized against those who disbelieve, that they are to be inmates of the Fire.
  Those who carry the Throne, and those around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for those who believe: “Our Lord, You have encompassed everything in mercy and knowledge; so forgive those who repent and follow Your path, and protect them from the agony of the Blaze.</description>

                <description>FRUITS Fruits are a vital part of the human diet and the easiest food for humans to digest.
Many fruits have a purifying and cleansing effect on the body, and most fruits are high in vitamins and very nutritious.
Some fruits have medicinal value as well.
In an emergency planting programme, cereals may be omitted from the human diet, but fruits should not be neglected. This shows their importance.
The following system can be used for planting big, medium and small categories of fruit trees:</description>

                <description>What is the foundation of morality?
This question has divided many people from the dawn of philosophy.
The young Socrates listened to the old Protagoras, the sophist, and asserted the theory of utilitarianism against the popular morality.
A similar confusion and uncertainty afflicts the first principles of all the sciences, even mathematics.
The truths which are ultimately accepted as the first principles of a science, are really the last results of metaphysical analysis.</description>

                <description>How does life get expression within the physical unit structure?
The 5 Layers Physical structures are composed of 5 fundamental layers:
 Ethereal Aerial Luminous Liquid Solid  A unit structure has a body made up of a composite of these 5 layerswith controlling nuclei.
 These layers should remain in requisite proportion.  Vital energy or práńáh is the structure&rsquo;s collective creative unifying energy.
 It depends on the mutual cohesion of these layers.</description>

                <description>Man&rsquo;s ability to think  God distinguished man from all the other animals by an ability to think. Perception - that is, consciousness, on the part of the person who perceives, in his essence of things that are outside his essence - is something peculiar to living beings to the exclusion of all other being 6 and existent things.
Living beings may obtain consciousness of things that are outside their essence through the external senses God has given them, that is, the senses of hearing, vision, smell, taste, and touch.</description>

                <description>The Cosmic Consciousness acts as the witnessing entity with the help of His Citishakti.
The wavelength of this Citishakti is infinite. So we say that it flows in a straight line.
When the mind or manah takes the átman – the witnessing entity of the unit mind – as its so-called object (this is to be done by complete surrender – there is no other way because actually the mind is the object of the átman), the mental waves will get straightened gradually.</description>

                <description>Self-reliance is the main objective of our farming projects, hence they should be oriented towards production.
They should not be dependent on outside resources.
An integrated approach to farming should include:
 agriculture horticulture floriculture sericulture lac culture apiculture dairy farming animal husbandry irrigation pisciculture pest control fertilizers cottage industries energy production research centres water conservation.  This approach will help make farming projects self-reliant.
Agriculture Agriculture is the science of cultivating the soil and rearing animals.</description>

                <description>Do material things exist?
I perceive them clearly and distinctly as the subject matter of pure mathematics. ; so I at least know that they could exist, because anything that I perceive in that way could be created by God.
(The only reason I have ever accepted for thinking that something could not be made by him is that there would be a contradiction in my perceiving it distinctly.) My faculty of imagination, which I am aware of using when I turn my mind to material things, also suggests that they really exist.</description>

This is done through 3 main systems of cropping:
 mixed cropping supplementary cropping crop rotation.  Cultivation should be done on the cooperative basis. Only cooperatives can support the expanding economic requirements of agriculture, like creating ponds, purchasing machinery, uniting local people to pressurise the government for irrigation facilities, etc.</description>

                <description>1. Dynasties are prior to towns and cities Towns and cities are secondary products of royal authority because building and city planning are features of sedentary culture arising from luxury and tranquility.
The towns and cities, with their vast constructions, are set up for the masses and not for the few. Thus, a united effort and much co-operation are needed for them.
They are not among the things that are necessary matters of general concern to human beings, in the sense that all human beings desire them or feel compelled to have them.</description>

                <description>Those who have dogmatized on nature from self-conceit or arrogance have inflicted the greatest injury on philosophy and learning.
 They have stifled and interrupted inquiry exactly in proportion as they have prevailed in bringing others to their opinion. Their own activity has not counterbalanced the mischief they have occasioned by corrupting and destroying that of others.  On the other hand, those who think on the contrary are not contemptible.</description>

                <description>Many plants have seeds which can be used to produce oil.
The oil extracted from the seeds of some of these plants is used to produce thickened oil, margarine and other products for human consumption.
The oil can also be burnt as a fuel; used to make cosmetics, shoe polish, furniture wax, medicines, hair oil, etc.; or refined for industrial purposes and used as machine oil, etc. The skin of some oil seeds, like groundnut, can also be removed to make flour to produce bread.</description>

                <description>Pest Control In the rainy season in the last week of Shrávańa there is water in the paddy fields of Bengal.
In these fields we should cultivate fish, but fishermen should not be allowed to catch these fish while the paddy is still growing. Harmful insecticides or pesticides should not be used in these fields because they will kill the fish and pollute the water system.
Alternative pesticides like neem paste pesticide should be used.</description>

 2  Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of your oaths.  3  The Prophet told something in confidence to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, and Allah made it known to him; he communicated part of it, and he avoided another part.</description>

Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is the Truth from your Lord, to warn a people who received no warner before you, that they may be guided.
 4  Allah is He who created the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six days, and then established Himself on the Throne. Apart from Him, you have no master and no intercessor.</description>

Yet the larger fixed stars are supposed to increase and render more intense the heat of the sun, as he approaches them, when the sun is in the sign of the Lion, for instance, and in the dog-days.</description>

Spiritual powers are the normal powers of the spiritual man. Through these powers, the spiritual man stands, sees, hears, speaks, in the spiritual world, as the physical man stands, sees, hears, speaks in the natural world.
There is a counterfeit presentment of the spiritual man, in the world of dreams, a shadow lord of shadows, who has his own dreamy powers of vision, of hearing, of movement; he has left the natural without reaching the spiritual.</description>

                <description>11  Those institutions which promote the public welfare are frequently recommended by:
 the same principle, the same love of system, and the same regard to the beauty of order, art, and contrivance  When a patriot exerts to improve the public police, his conduct does not always arise from pure sympathy with the happiness of those who will benefit of it.
A public-spirited man encourages the mending of high roads not commonly from a fellow-feeling with carriers and wagoners.</description>

                <description>Pulses are a valuable source of protein, and indispensable in the vegetarian diet.
Most pulses are high in protein but have varying degrees of fat. They are easier to digest than casein, but less substantial.
They are more important as a food than cereals, and in emergency conditions, pulses are more essential for health. Some pulses are also used for oil production.
For farming, pulses are important as nitrogen fixers. The roots of all pulses should be left in the soil for some time after the harvest so that they can perform this function.</description>

They marveled that a warner has come to them from among them. The disbelievers say, “This is something strange.
 3  When we have died and become dust? This is a farfetched return.” 4  We know what the earth consumes of them, and with Us is a comprehensive book. 5  But they denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a confused state.</description>

                <description>Rivers There are 3 types of rivers:
 ice fed rain fed subterranean fed.  Ice-fed rivers cause flooding when there is an increase in the temperature, whereas rain fed and subterranean fed rivers only cause seasonal flooding when there is heavy rain. However, an increase in the temperature can dry them up.
Are the rivers in Ráŕh perennial or seasonal?
Are they ice fed or rain fed, or do they get water from subterranean sources due to the high level of the artesian water?</description>

                <description>Riverside plantations are important for:
 preventing floods conserving water regulating the flow of water in rivers keeping soil moist and fertile.  Some examples of plants which are useful riverside trees include banyan, date palm, neem or margosa, tamarind, simul, imli and fruit trees. If horticulture is developed along the banks of rivers, the rivers will never dry up.
Most trees with tap root systems do not alleviate riverside erosion, but eucalyptus is an exception.</description>

 Even the stage after formation of the unit mind is the effect of all the past stages.  &ldquo;Saḿskára&rdquo; is the effect of action in the past stages.
 It gives momentum to the unit mind.  The initial creation of the unit mind is the result of certain forces reacting in crudification.
The ultimate cause of momentum of every force is the Macrocosm.</description>

He was slain in battle. Ten days later when the bodies of the dead are decomposing, his body was found unaffected by decay. It was carried home to be buried.
On the 12th day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world.</description>

 myself as a thing that thinks and is not extended the stone as a thing that is extended and does not think so that the two conceptions differ enormously  But they seem to have the classification ‘substance’ in common.
External objects come from external ideas, of which the only remaining idea is the the idea of God. ‘God’ means a substance that is infinite, eternal, unchangeable, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, which created myself and anything else that may exist.</description>

                <description>The essence of all physical and metaphysical diversities is the Supreme One – the noumenal cause of this phenomenal world.
There are 5 fundamental layers of this phenomenal world:
 kśiti (solid) ap (liquid) tejas (luminous) marut (aerial) vyoma (ethereal)  These are physical for the microcosm, but mental for the Macrocosm.
Crudification (saiṋcara or saḿkrama) is:
 the transformation or metamorphosis of the One into these layers. a process of analysis.</description>

                <description>Due to internal clash and cohesion, and division and association amongst the 3 immanent principles (sentient, mutative and static), the resultant force bursts out at any one vertex of the triangle formed due to the ever-flowing eternal force. This leads to the crudification which is the inanimate phase of creation.
In the living bodies after the formation of crudest solid layer, the division and association of matter result in the formation of mind.</description>

                <description>Sugar is an important part of the human diet. For many farmers, sugar crops are an essential source of income.
Sugar is also used in the production of alcohol, which has many medicinal and industrial uses.
Fermented sugar juice is used to prepare vinegar, and the residual materials from vinegar production are used to make yeast. Sugar foods come in many forms according to the type of sugar crop and the degree to which it is refined.</description>

                <description>The 3 gunas get imbalance because of probability This creates desire as an identity-wave, powered by static negative energy. This is why yoga and Buddhism advocates ending desire or just desiring the Supreme The wave degrades into 5 physical layers, with its physical energies Many waves lead to some waves being the environment of other waves A combo of the 5 layers has a probability of getting a lot of sentient prakrti (manifest shiva) to be a good environment for life The good combo creates pranah and unit mind In time, from clash and cohesion of the shiva and shakti, the unit mind develops an ego from its inherent atman The unit mind is a reflection of the paramatman which is its goal since it was created from the positive force Pranah, as positive static energy, has 5 internal and 5 external types to help the mind grow and the atman to be more like the paramataman The growth of mind is through its heart chakra.</description>

                <description>The Cycle of Existence or Brahma Cakra is tthe collective name of crudification and subtilification.
 It has no uniformity of flow.  the sentient force is faster than the mutative the mutative force is faster than the static.    Thus, in the beginning of crudification speed is attained. Similarly, after elevation, the influence of the sentient force causes the unit mind to reach sámánya deha (a stage beyond the hirańmaya kośa where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is faster.</description>

                <description>The Created Layers (Bhútatattva) Crudification (saiṋcara) is a process of analysis, transforming one into many.
Avidyámáyá is the operative force behind its multicreative characteristics.
 At different phases of this crudification, creation-layers (bhútas) with their peculiar properties come into existence.  Bhúta means “created being”. Generally, it refers to the past.
Through the influence of the sentient force on the Macrocosmic Nucleus, the Identity-Layer comes into being.
 It turns into the Ego-Layer by the activation of the mutative force.</description>

 sat: existence cit: knowledge ánanda: bliss  The correct translation is:
 sat: a Transcendental Entity that undergoes no change chit: consciousness ananda: divine bliss  The Transcendental Entity may appear to undergo a metamorphosis but actually undergoes no qualitative change.
 Hence, Sat can only mean the Transcendental Entity – an absolute entity which undergoes no change. Ananda is divine bliss experienced subjectively and not in an objective manner.</description>

                <description>The Defects of Well Irrigation Deep tube wells ae not the solution to the water crisis.
Well irrigation causes the level of the water-table to drop. The continuous use of well irrigation dries up the subterranean flow of water.
Initially, the effects of continuous well irrigation may not be easy to perceive, but eventually a fertile region will be transformed into a desert.
In fact, if the subterranean water level stays at above 20-25 feet, the surface vegetation will not be affected.</description>

Krishna Why did you grow weak? Cast off cowardice! Wake up!  Arjuna How could I shoot with shafts in the battle?
It is better to live on beggar&rsquo;s bread with those we love alive, than survive with them dead.
 Sanjaya: Arjuna became silent.
Krishna You grieve when you should not be grireving!
You lacking wisdom! The wise in heart mourn not for those who live, nor those who die.</description>

                <description>Why do droughts occur?
There are 3 main causes of droughts:
 The wanton destruction of plants or indiscriminate deforestation The low pressure systems over oceans and big seas The sudden changes in the angular movement of the sun and other celestial bodies like comets, nebulae and galaxies.  Deforestation prevents the plants from nourishing the earth.
The fibrous roots of plants absorb and hold considerable amounts of water which is slowly released into the soil.</description>

                <description>The force at the core leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party, which is based on Marxism-Leninism.
A revolution requires a revolutionary party. Without the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the masses to defeat imperialism and its running dogs.
"Revolutionary Forces of the World Unite, Fight Against Imperialist Aggression!" (November 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 284.*  Without the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party, without the Chinese Communists as the mainstay of the Chinese people, China can never achieve independence and liberation, or industrialization and the modernization of her agriculture.</description>

                <description>Spirituality is not a utopian ideal.
 It is a practical philosophy which can be practised and realized in daily life, however mundane it be.  Spirituality stands for evolution and elevation, and not for superstition in action or pessimism.
All fissiparous tendencies and group or clan philosophies which tend to create the shackles of narrow-mindedness are not connected with spirituality and should be discouraged.
Only that which leads to broadness of unison should be accepted.</description>

FIRST MEDITATION: What can be called into doubt Some years ago, I was struck by:
 how many false things I had believed how doubtful was the structure of beliefs that I had based on them.  I realized that if I wanted to establish anything permanent in the sciences, I needed – just once in my life – to:
 demolish everything completely start again from the foundations.</description>

Such ideas have their own true and immutable natures, which are not under my control.
Even if there are not and never were any triangles outside my thought, still, when I imagine a triangle I am constrained in how I do this, because there is a determinate nature or essence or form of triangle that is eternal, unchanging, and independent of my mind.</description>

                <description>The Cosmic Identity as Identity-Layer from Sentient Principle of Activity Thus, Activity expresses Herself as the resultant force that starts crudification*.
 This Activity is sentient, though rudimentally static. It creates the Pure “I” feeling in Consciousness.   *Superphysics Note: Crudificationis the start of the feelings
 It is a pure “I” feeling because sentient Activity cannot go any further.
This stage is known as the Identity-Layer (Mahattattva).
 It is nothing but the Cosmic “I” This is the first bondage of Consciousness by His innate sentient Activity.</description>

                <description>Objects as Mind-Stuff As static Activity starts its domination, it forces the Ego-Layer or Active Identity to separate from the Identity-Layer or Cosmic Identity to become the object of the Cosmic Identity.
This allows the Ego-Layer to have full activity through the cruder mind-stuff (citta). Thus, the Cosmic Subjective “I” or Cosmic Identity is partially transformed by the Principle of Activity into:
 the Cosmic Active “I” [Acting Identity or cause] the Cosmic objective “I” from a portion of its Cosmic Subjective “I” [target or effect].</description>

A body is large when seen near and appears small when seen from afar. The same object appears straight when seen out of the water, and crooked when in the water. The concave becomes convex due to the illusion on colours to which the sight is liable.</description>

                <description>1  Man is the minister and interpreter of nature.
He tries to understand the order of nature.  2  The unassisted hand and the understanding left to itself possess but little power.
Effects are produced by the means of instruments and helps, which the understanding requires no less than the hand; and as instruments either promote or regulate the motion of the hand, so those that are applied to the mind prompt or protect the understanding.</description>

                <description>38  The idols and false notions which have already preoccupied the human understanding, and are deeply rooted in it, not only so beset men’s minds that they become difficult of access, but even when access is obtained will again meet and trouble us in the instauration of the sciences, unless mankind when forewarned guard themselves with all possible care against them.
 39  4 species of idols beset the human mind,[20][9] to which (for distinction’s sake) we have assigned names, calling the first Idols of the Tribe, the second Idols of the Den, the third Idols of the Market, the fourth Idols of the Theatre.</description>

                <description>LXXI. The sciences we possess have been principally derived from the Greeks; for the addition of the Roman, Arabic, or more modern writers, are but few and of small importance, and such as they are, are founded on the basis[47] of Greek invention. But the wisdom of the Greeks was professional and disputatious, and thus most adverse to the investigation of truth. The name, therefore, of sophists, which the contemptuous spirit of those who deemed themselves philosophers, rejected and transferred to the rhetoricians—Gorgias,[36] Protagoras, Hippias, Polus—might well suit the whole tribe, such as Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Theophrastus, and their successors—Chrysippus, Carneades, and the rest.</description>

                <description>92  By far the greatest obstacle to the advancement of the sciences, and the undertaking of any new attempt or department, is in men’s despair and the idea of impossibility.
Men of a prudent and exact turn of thought are altogether diffident in matters of this nature, considering the obscurity of nature, the shortness of life, the deception of the senses, and weakness of the judgment.
They think, therefore, that in the revolutions of ages and of the world there are certain floods and ebbs of the sciences, and that they grow and flourish at one time, and wither and fall off at another, that when they have attained a certain degree and condition they can proceed no further.</description>

                <description>122  People might object that we are being singular and harsh for trying to banish all authorities and sciences with one stroke and assault by our own efforts without the help of the ancients.
Now we are aware, that had we been ready to act otherwise than sincerely, it was not difficult to refer our present method to remote ages, prior to those of the Greeks (since the sciences in all probability flourished more in their natural state, though silently, than when they were paraded with the fifes and trumpets of the Greeks); or even (in parts, at least) to some of the Greeks themselves, and to derive authority and honor from thence; as men of no family labor to raise and form nobility for themselves in some ancient line, by the help of genealogies.</description>

                <description>The kulakuńd́alinii, the “coiled serpentine”, is the theoretical negative force of the unit body.
This is why it is different for each individual.
Its fundamental negativity tends towards the final merger into Consciousness for liberation.The sádhaná is for a psycho-physical liberation in the initial stage. Its starting-point must be in the crudest manifestation.
It must reside in that portion of the physical body from which the crudest matter (kśititattva) of the body is controlled.</description>

If we think of our lives as tasks laid on us by the Master of Life, if we look on all duties as parts of that Master’s work, entrusted to us, and forming our life-work; then, if we obey, promptly, loyally, sincerely, we shall enter by degrees into the Master’s life and share the Master’s power. Thus we shall be initiated into the spiritual will.</description>

Here is teaching of the utmost import, both for understanding and for practice.
To the psychic nature belong all the ebb and flow of emotion, all hoping and fearing, desire and hate: the things that make the multitude of men and women deem themselves happy or miserable.</description>

                <description>Mind Crudification transforms the transcendental Consciousness into Mind, as the Identity-Layer, Ego-Layer, and mindstuff.
The first 2 stages of bondage are theoretical.
 The movement or vibration is unrestricted by the relative factors of time, space and person. These 2 stages are not perceivable.   But the third stage, He as mindstuff, comes within the jurisdiction of autoperception.
In the process of subtilification (pratisaiṋcara), by division and decimation, solids get metamorphosed into subtler factors.</description>

                <description>The availability of the minimum essentialities of life plays a vital part not only in achieving world brotherhood, but also in the development of human personality.
This should be tackled on a world footing, and should be based on certain fundamental presumptions.
Every human being has certain minimum requirements which he or she must be guaranteed. Guaranteed availability of foodstuff, clothing, medical assistance and housing accommodation should be arranged so that human beings may be able to utilize their surplus energy (energy up till now engaged in procuring the essentialities of life) in subtler pursuits.</description>

An object or objectivity is nothing but a wave motion within the body of the Cosmos. We thus establish the wave theory of modern science through an independent logical outlook.
Life consists only of an ocean of waves.
Every layer (bhúta) from the aethereal to the solid is in an eternal flow.</description>

 All other, mundane, subjectivities or objectivities are mere blendings of the absolute subjectivity.  Therefore, the mind is not an absolute entity.
 Instead, it is a transformed state of consciousness. To perform its actions, it depends on the motor or sensory organs as its direct agents. Afferent and efferent nerves, in their turn, act as direct agents of these organs.  The nerves:</description>

 To find expression, the mind adopts certain inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupations. These occupations (love, hatred, fear, etc.) are known as propensities (vrtti).  A propensity is “the way of expression of mind”.</description>

                <description>Profit is the value realized from human labor.
Man, by nature, needs something to feed him and to provide for him in all the conditions and stages of his life from the time of his (early) growth to his maturity and on to his old age.
Everyone tries to get things. Thus, whatever is obtained by one is denied to the other, unless he gives something in exchange for it.</description>

                <description>1  The aim of human power is to generate a new nature on a body.
The aim of human knowledge is to discover the true form or difference of a given nature.
; and subordinate to these primary labors are two others of a secondary nature and inferior stamp. Under the first must be ranked the transformation of concrete bodies from one to another, which is possible within certain limits; under the second, the discovery, in every species of generation and motion, of the latent and uninterrupted process from the manifest efficient and manifest subject matter up to the given form: and a like discovery of the latent conformation of bodies which are at rest instead of being in motion.</description>

Socrates Socrates= The chief theme of my yesterday’s discourse was the State—how constituted and of what citizens composed it would seem likely to be most perfect. We began by separating the husbandmen and the artisans from the class of defenders of the State.  We gave each one that single employment and art which was suited to his nature.
We said who we wanted to be our warriors who were to be guardians of the city against attacks from inside and out.</description>

Let each of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only.
This will help us learn and discern between good and evil. In this way, we can always and everywhere choose the better life.

                <description>Livelihood (making a living) means the desire for sustenance and the effort to obtain it. &ldquo;Livelihood&rdquo; (ma&rsquo;ash) is a maf&rsquo;al formation from `aysh &ldquo;life.&rdquo;
The idea is that &lsquo;aysh &ldquo;life&rdquo; is obtained only through the things that go into making a living, and they are therefore considered, with some exaggeration, &ldquo;the place of life.&rdquo; 14
Sustenance and profit may be obtained - through- having the power to take them away from others and to appropriate them according to a generally recognized norm.</description>

Worship by work, for who renounceth not Works not as Yogin. So is that well said:

                <description>In Sanskrit, this vital energy is always plural because it is a collection of 10 important forces (váyus) with 5 working internally, and 5 working externally of the physical structure.
   Internal Vayu Jurisdiction Function     Práńa navel point to the vocal cord inhalation and exhalation   Apána anus to the navel point controls the movement of urine and stool   Samána navel maintains adjustment between práńa and apána   Udána throat controls the vocal cord and the voice   Vyána  regulates blood circulation and the afferent and efferent nerves    Death A physical deficiency or defect in any portion of the body results in the weakening of práńa and apána.</description>

                <description>At the beginning of this earth, there was absolute silence – there were no living beings or even plants.
This continued for hundreds of millions of years, until the earth was properly formed.
Then a phase came when rain and storms started, and by a gradual process, life emerged.
Thanks to the rain, carbon atoms got infused with vital energy (práńa shakti). Carbon atoms along with protoplasmic clash and cohesion formed this vital energy.</description>

                <description>1  The practices which make for union with the Soul are:
 fervent aspiration spiritual reading complete obedience to the Master.  “Fervent aspiration” means “fire”. In the Eastern teaching, it means the fire which gives life and light, and at the same time the fire which purifies.
We have, therefore, as our first practice, as the first of the means of spiritual growth, that fiery quality of the will which enkindles and illumines, and, at the same time, the steady practice of purification, the burning away of all known impurities.</description>

To interpret history from this viewpoint is historical materialism; standing in opposition to this viewpoint is historical idealism.

                <description>The liberty of the press is one of the securities against corrupt or tyrannical government.
The law of England today on press freedom is as servile as it was in the time of the Tudors. But there is little danger of its being used against political discussion except during insurrection. The governments in constitutional countries do not often attempt to control public expression.
Let us suppose that the government is entirely at one with the people, but stifles the freedom of the press.</description>

They believe that all the treasures of the nations of the past were stored underground and sealed with magic talismans. These seals can then be broken only by those who have the necessary knowledge and can offer the proper incense, prayers, and sacrifices to break them.
The citizens in Ifriqiyah believe that the European Christians who lived in Ifriqiyah before Islam, buried their property and entrusted its (hiding place) to written lists, until such time as they might find a way to dig it up again.</description>

                <description>People who use utility as the moral basis usually make the ignorant blunder of defining utility as being opposed to pleasure.
Pro-utility writers, from Epicurus to Bentham, defined it not something as different from pleasure, but pleasure itself. It includes an exemption from pain.
Yet the common herd perpetually fall into this shallow mistake of separating utility and pleasure.
The Greatest Happiness Principle says that:
 actions which promote happiness are moral actions which produce the reverse of happiness are immoral  Happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain.</description>

                <description>A merchant concerns himself with buying and selling, earning money and making a profit. This requires cunning, willingness to enter into disputes, cleverness, constant quarreling, and great persistence.
These are things that belong to commerce. They are qualities detrimental to and destructive of virtuousness and manliness, because it is unavoidable that actions influence the soul.
Good actions influence it toward goodness and virtue. Evil and deceitful actions influence it in the opposite sense.</description>

Al-Bukhari explained this (statement) as referring to too intense an occupation with (agriculture) and he entitled the chapter in which he dealt with the tradition in question= &ldquo;Warning against the consequences of (too intensive an) occupation with agricultural implements or transgression of the stipulated limit.</description>

 those between ourselves and the enemy those among the people themselves.  These two are totally different in their nature.
On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957), 1st pocket ed… p. 2.  To understand these two different types of contradictions correctly, we must first be clear on what is meant by &ldquo;the people&rdquo; and what is meant by &ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;… At the present stage, the period of building socialism, the classes, strata and social groups which favour, support and work for the cause of socialist construction all come within the category of the people, while the social forces and groups which resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to or sabotage socialist construction are all enemies of the people.</description>

It is a favor shown by God to His servants and a kind of relief granted them to help them along in matters affecting their well-being (masalih) for which He is responsible to them. God said= &ldquo;Whenever We abrogate a verse or consign it to oblivion, We bring one that is better, or as good.</description>

 in each thing in relation to itself, and in all things in relation to each other  Back then, nothing had any proportion except by accident. Nothing even was named.All these the creator first set in order, and out of them he constructed the universe, which was a single animal comprehending in itself all other animals, mortal and immortal.</description>

                <description>What is the rightful limit to self-interest?
How much of human life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society?
Individuality should have the part of life in which it is chiefly the individual that is interested.
Society should have the part which chiefly interests society.
Society is not founded on a contract. Inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it is for no good purpose.</description>

                <description>It is impossible:
 for anything to be moved without a mover. for a mover to exist without something which can be moved  Motion cannot exist where either of these are lacking. It is for impossible for these to be uniform. Therefore we must assign rest to uniformity and motion to the lack of uniformity.
Inequality is the cause of the nature which is lacking in uniformity. Why things when divided do not cease to pass through one another and to change their place?</description>

Fire has a dividing or cutting power on our bodies. We all feel that fire is sharp. We may further consider:
 the fineness of the sides of fire the sharpness of the angles of fire the smallness of the particles of fire, and the swiftness of the motion of fire  All this makes the action of fire violent and sharp, so that it cuts whatever it meets.</description>

I have shown how much our approbation of humanity and justice depended on the concord between the affections of the agent and the spectators.
 21  The propriety of generosity and public spirit is founded on the same principle with the propriety of justice.
Generosity is different from humanity.
Those two qualities at first sight seem so nearly allied.</description>

                <description>This is because each person cannot obtain all the necessities of life by himself. For instance, no one, by himself, can obtain the wheat that he needs for food.
But when six persons work together to obtain their food separately or collectively, they will be able to have an excess of food. Such persons include:
 a smith and a carpenter to make the tools, a person to be in charge of the oxen, persons to plow the soil and harvest the ripe grain and all the other agricultural activities  The combined labor produces more than the needs of the workers.</description>

The nature of the Idea-being was everlasting.
But it is impossible to make the creature everlasting. So He resolved to have a moving image of eternity.</description>

                <description>Liberty implies that individuals should regulate each other by mutual agreement in things that jointly regard themselves and others. But since that will may change, it is often necessary that they should enter into engagements with one another. When they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that those engagements should be kept.
Yet in the laws, this general rule has some exceptions.
Persons are not held to engagements which violate the rights of third parties.</description>

 The individual is not accountable to society for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself.  Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the only measures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disapprobation of his conduct.
Actions that hurt the interests of others should be punished socially or legally.</description>

In its most proper and primitive signification, the word &lsquo;sympathy&rsquo; denotes our fellow-feeling with the sufferings of others, not with their enjoyments.

These laws are derived from:
 the Qur&rsquo;an the Sunnah (traditions) the evidence Muhammad has established for knowledge of the laws  The laws evolved from the whole of this evidence are called &ldquo;jurisprudence&rdquo; (fiqh).

                <description>29  A divided sympathy makes anger and resentment so disagreeable. The social and benevolent feelings are opposite to these. They cause a redoubled sympathy which almost always render them agreeable.
The indifferent observer is almost always pleased with=
 Generosity Humanity Kindness Compassion Mutual friendship Esteem  The observer&rsquo;s sympathy with the subject-person generating those feelings exactly coincides with his sympathy for the object-person who is receiving those feelings.</description>

                <description>One of the strongest obstacles to the doctrine that Utility or Happiness is the criterion of right and wrong. This has been drawn from the idea of Justice which is the powerful sentiment that resembles instinct.
This has made people think that the Just must have an existence in Nature as something absolute-generically distinct from every variety of the Expedient, and, in idea, opposed to it, though (as is commonly acknowledged) never, in the long run, disjoined from it in fact.</description>

                <description>As long as sedentary civilization is incomplete and the city not fully organized, people are concerned only with the necessities such as obtaining of food.
Then, when the city is organized and the (available) labor increases and pays for the necessities and is more than enough (for the inhabitants), the surplus is spent on luxuries.
The crafts and sciences are the result of man&rsquo;s ability to think, through which he is distinguished from the animals.</description>

                <description>Our sympathy with the false idea of the happiness of the rich and the great is the basis of ambition  16  We parade our riches and hide our poverty because people sympathize more with our joy than our sorrow.
We are most mortified to:
 expose our distress in public, and feel that no one conceives half of what we suffer.  We pursue riches and avoid poverty chiefly from this regard to mankind&rsquo;s sentiments.</description>

Some are for necessities:
 foodstuffs like wheat and barley foods, such as beans, chick-peas, peas, and other edible grains wholesome foods such as onions, garlic, and the like.  Some are for conveniences or luxuries:
 seasonings, fruits, clothes, utensils, mounts, all the crafts, and buildings.  When a city is large and highly developed, the prices of necessary foodstuffs and corresponding items are low.</description>

 never so graceful as the social feelings never so odious as the unsocial feelings.  When excessive, the selfish feelings are never so disagreeable as the unsocial feeling of excessive resentment.</description>

                <description>This is the first and oldest craft of sedentary civilization. It is the knowledge of how to go about using houses and mansions for cover and shelter. This is because man has the natural disposition to reflect upon the outcome of things.
Thus, he must reflect upon how to avert the harm arising from heat and cold by using houses which have walls. and roofs to intervene between him and those things on all sides.</description>

Even if prosperity were as great as possible, the acquisition and accumulation of real property would be gradual. It may come about through inheritance from one&rsquo;s forefathers and blood relatives, so that eventually the property of many comes to one person, who thus possesses much.</description>

Just as there is not a single thing in the world without a dual nature (this is the law of the unity of opposites), so imperialism and all reactionaries have a dual nature - they are real tigers and paper tigers at the same time.</description>

It also shows what is good for (a new-born child), after it is born, as we shall mention. The craft is as a rule restricted to women, since they, as women, may see the pudenda of other women. The woman who exercises this craft is called midwife (qabilah, literally, &ldquo;the woman who receives&rdquo;).</description>

                <description>"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates."—The Kybalion.  The Principle of Vibration says that:
 Nothing is at rest Everything moves, vibrates, and circles.  This Principle was adopted by some of the early Greek philosophers in their systems. But, then, for centuries it forgotten.
But in the 19th Century science re-discovered this. In the 20th Century, scientific discoveries have added additional proof this truth.
Everything is in constant movement and vibration.</description>

Dream visions and dream interpretation existed among the ancients, as among later generations. It existed among former (pre-Islamic) religious groups and nations. However, their dream interpretation did not reach us, 554 because we have been satisfied with the discussions of Muslim dream interpreters.
In any case, all human beings can have dream visions, and these visions must be interpreted.</description>

                <description>To ensure the maximum utilization of every inch of land, there is also a system of planting in the boundary areas of all schools, farms, orchards, homes, etc., as well as beside all roads.
For example, trees with spreading branches, like most fruit trees and even some timber trees, should be planted all around the perimeter of such places at fixed distances.
Palm trees, which grow straight up, should be planted in between the fruit trees, as they do not block the sun light from the fruit trees.</description>

It also studies the essential properties of the quantities (measurements), as, for instance=
The angles of any triangle are equal to two right angles.
Parallel lines do not intersect anywhere, even when they extend to infinity.
The opposite angles formed when two lines intersect are equal to each other. The result of multiplying the first and the third of four quantities in a proportion is equal to that of multiplying the second and the fourth.</description>

                <description>Astronomy studies the motions of the fixed stars and the planets.
From the manner in which these motions take place, astronomy deduces by geometrical methods the existence of certain shapes and positions of the spheres requiring the occurrence of those motions which can be perceived by the senses. Astronomy thus proves, for instance, by the existence of the precession of the equinoxes, that the center of the earth is not identical with the center of the sphere of the sun.</description>

                <description>In the past 10-15 years, the dual-mind idea has manifested itself so strongly. Psychology students have been struck by its persistence which has led to many plausible theories on the nature of these &ldquo;two minds.&rdquo;
Thomson J. Hudson grew popular in 1893 through his theory of the &ldquo;objective and subjective minds&rdquo; which he held existed in every individual.
Other writers have theories on:
 the &ldquo;conscious and subconscious minds&rdquo; the &ldquo;voluntary and involuntary minds&rdquo; the &ldquo;the active and passive minds,&rdquo; etc.</description>

                <description>Can a Communist, who is an internationalist, at the same time be a patriot?
We hold that he not only can be but must be. The specific content of patriotism is determined by historical conditions. There is the &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; of the Japanese aggressors and of Hitler, and there is our patriotism.
Communists must resolutely oppose the &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; of the Japanese aggressors and of Hitler. The Communists of Japan and Germany are defeatists with regard to the wars being waged by their countries.</description>

                <description>Logic concerns the norms enabling a person to distinguish between right and wrong, both in definitions that give information about the essence of things, and in arguments that assure apperception.
This 687 comes about as follows: The basis of perception is the sensibilia that are perceived by the five senses. All living beings, those which are rational as well as the others, participate in this kind of perception. Man is distinguished from the animals by his ability to perceive universals, which are things abstracted from the sensibilia.</description>

                <description>Everyone engaged in practical work must investigate conditions at the lower levels. Such investigation is especially necessary for those who know theory but do not know the actual conditions, for otherwise they will not be able to link theory with practice.
Although my assertion, &ldquo;No investigation no right to speak&rdquo;, has been ridiculed as &ldquo;narrow empiricism&rdquo;, to this day I do not regret having made it; far from regretting it, I still insist that without investigation there cannot possibly be any right to speak.</description>

The first kind is sorcery. The second kind is talismans.
These sciences are forbidden by the (various) religious laws, because they are harmful and require (their practitioners) to direct themselves to (beings) other than God, such as stars and other things.</description>

                <description>The pandemic has forced many people out of jobs and livelihoods. This has then led governments to turn to give dole-outs, pandemic loans, and stimilus checks.
Those measures try to ease the present burdens by transferring it to the future, from the reasoning and hope that the pandemic will be gone by then. That would then allow economies to go back to normal and the debts to be repaid.
However, our model * from 2015 shows that things will not get better anytime soon.</description>

The (alchemical) operation might potentially, be performed with anything, because the elements exist in every thing.
We want to know what produces the (alchemical) operation (both) potentially and actually. Therefore, we turn to the statement of al-Harrani 985 that 986all dyeing consists of two kinds.

Every preposition denotes some relation considered in concrete with the co-relative object. The preposition &ldquo;above&rdquo; denotes the relation of superiority, not in abstract, as it is expressed by the word superiority, but in concrete with some co-relative object.
In this phrase, for example, the tree above the cave, the word above expresses a certain relation between the tree and the cave, and it expresses this relation in concrete with the co-relative object, the cave.</description>

All machines are generally, when first invented, extremely complex in their principles, and there is often a particular principle of motion for every particular movement which it is intended they should perform. Succeeding improvers observe, that one principle may be so applied as to produce several of those movements; and thus the machine becomes gradually more and more simple, and produces its effects with fewer wheels, and fewer principles of motion.</description>

No affirmation can be expressed without the assistance of some verb. We never speak but in order to express our opinion that something either is or is not. But the word denoting this event, or this matter of fact, which is the subject of our affirmation, must always be a verb.
Impersonal verbs, which express in one word a complete event, which preserve in the expression that perfect simplicity and unity, 316 which there always is in the object and in the idea, and which suppose no abstraction, or metaphysical division of the event into its several constituent members of subject and attribute, would, in all probability, be the species of verbs first invented.</description>

                <description>In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines.
There is no such thing as art for art&rsquo;s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics.
Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause. They are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine.</description>

                <description>Activity Method     Trade Barter using rice    The Koreans (Sinlo) descend from the Pien-han.
Korea rises opposite to the sea entrance to Canton. But, from the popular superstition on what geomancers call the relation between north and south, traders going to Korea must first go to Ssi-ming, and then go out to sea again. Others say that the water current of Canton gradually lessens, which makes it necessary to pass by Ssi-ming.</description>

                <description>In transforming a backward agricultural China into an advanced industrialized country, we are confronted with arduous tasks and our experience is far from adequate. So we must be good at learning.
"Opening Address at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China " (September 15, 1956).  Conditions are changing all the time. To adapt to the new conditions, one must study. Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism and are comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on studying, have to absorb what is new and study new problems.</description>

 it is a proper way of making a living the alchemists find it easier and simpler to acquire property  In fact, however, they have to pay for (their efforts) in the form of trouble, hardship, and difficulties, and in the form of persecution by the authorities and loss of property through expenditures. In addition, he 1073 loses standing and, eventually, when his secret 1074 is discovered, faces ruin.</description>

 political authority clan authority religious authority  Women, are also dominated by these, but also dominated by the men as the authority of the husband.
These four authorities - political, clan, religious and masculine - are the embodiment of the whole feudal-patriarchal ideology and system. They are the four thick ropes binding the Chinese people, particularly the peasants.</description>

                <description>The (alchemical) process follows these lines= The (alchemists) take a substance possessing primary preparedness. They use it as the basis. In treating and processing it, they imitate the way nature processes substances in mines and, eventually, transforms them into gold or silver. They (try) hard to increase the active and passive powers (in the process), so that it will be completed in a shorter time (than required by nature). It has been explained in the proper place that an increase in the power of the agent shortens the time needed for his activity.</description>

                <description>The biggest fallacy of Economics is Market Equilibrium which is taught in basic economics or &lsquo;Econ101&rsquo; everywhere as the supply and demand curve forming an &lsquo;X&rsquo; and meeting in a state called &rsquo;exact equilibrium&rsquo;. Smith exposed this as mercantile sophistry in the 18th century, then called the &lsquo;balance of trade&rsquo;. To prove that this idea of &lsquo;balance&rsquo; is the same in essence with the &rsquo;equilibrium&rsquo; of economics, let&rsquo;s compare the philosophy behind both ideas.</description>

                <description>Supply and Demand Together We combine both curves to come up with a Supply and Demand model.
Samuelson&rsquo;s Version Samuelson justifies the unnatural supply curve with buying and selling through an auctioneer scenario. This is the same sophistical technique used by Jevons and Marshall, in their attempt to justify equilibrium.
Which level will the price actually go? And how much will then be produced and consumed?.. Let us proceed what an auctioneer would do, i.</description>

                <description>The storehouse of human science is the soul of man. In it, God has implanted perception (idrak) enabling it to think and, thus, to acquire (scientific knowledge). (The process) starts with perception (tasawwur) of the realities and is then continued by affirmation or negation of the essential attributes of the (realities), either directly or through an intermediary.
Man&rsquo;s ability to think thus eventually produces a problematic situation which it tries to solve affirmatively or negatively.</description>

It makes them lazy and induces them to lie and be insincere.

                <description>The First Law of Value introduced Exchangeable Value which is seen as Nominal Price to the Buyer. The Second Law of Value introduces Real Price which is the Exchangeable Value to the Seller.
 Real value is the value of the effort, trouble, hardship, and sentimentalism that is put into the Item by its owner or seller. This leads to the Effort theory of value that we derived from Adam Smith, which is opposite of the Labor theory of value of Karl Marx Nominal value is the value of the Item to its buyer/s who may or may not have idea of its real value to its owner  The Second Law of Value states that value goes from areas with high value to areas with low value in order to spread out the value and remove the lack in society.</description>

                <description>In order to address all the demand in society, supply has to be exchanged through a medium.
This creates the Third Law of Value which states that value is transferred through fair exchange whether it be through money, barter, points, promises, etc. This mirrors the First Law of Thermodynamics, known as the law of conservation of energy*. That law states that energy cannot be destroyed. Instead, it merely changes forms.</description>

When a scholar is of Arab origin, he is non-Arab in language and upbringing and has non-Arab teachers. This is so in spite of the fact that Islam is an Arabic religion, and its founder was an Arab.
This is because at the beginning Islam had no sciences or crafts because of the simple desert attitude.</description>

                <description>There are 3 kinds of soul within us, having each of them motions
 one part, if remaining inactive and ceasing from its natural motion, must necessarily become very weak, but that which is trained and exercised, very strong.  Wherefore we should take care that the movements of the different parts of the soul should be in due proportion.
God gave the sovereign part of the human soul to be the divinity of each one, being that part which, as we say, dwells at the top of the body, and inasmuch as we are a plant not of an earthly but of a heavenly growth, raises us from earth to our kindred who are in heaven.</description>

                <description>Hainan is the Chu-ai and Tan-ir of the Han period.
When the Emperor Wu-ti (BC 140-86) 86) had made the conquest of Southern Yue, he sent a mission from Suwon across the sea to reconnoitre Hainan.
As a consequence, the 2 perfectures of Chu-ai and Tan-ir were established.
His successor Chau-ti (BC )
and incorporated it in Chu-ai. On the advice of Kia Kiian-chi the Emperor abandoned Chu-ai, and Liang (502—527) C.</description>

                <description>The disorders of the soul depend on the body and originate as follows.
The disease of the mind is caused by a lack of intelligence. It has two kinds:
 madness ignorance  These are mental diseases. Excessive pains and pleasures are the greatest diseases of the soul.
For a man who is in great joy or in great pain, in his unreasonable eagerness to attain the one and to avoid the other, is not able to see or to hear anything rightly.</description>

                <description>This science is concerned with explaining the (conventional) meanings of the words of the language. This comes about as follows. The habit of the Arabic language, as far as the vowels called i&rsquo;rab by the grammarians are concerned, became corrupted. 1254 Rules for protecting the (vowel endings) were developed, as we have stated. However, the (process of) corruption continued on account of the close contact (of the Muslims) with non-Arabs.</description>

 lexicography grammar syntax and style (bayan) literature  Knowledge of them all is necessary for religious scholars, since the source of all religious laws is the Qur&rsquo;an and the Sunnah, which are in Arabic. Their transmitters, the men around Muhammad and the men of the second generation, were Arabs. Their difficulties are to be explained from the language they used. Thus, those who want to be religious scholars must know the sciences connected with the Arabic language.</description>

                <description>All languages are habits similar to crafts techniques. They are habits (located) in the tongue and serve the purpose of expressing ideas.
The good or inadequate (character of such expression) depends on the perfection or deficiency of the habit. This does not apply to individual words but to word combinations. A speaker who possesses a perfect (linguistic) habit and is thus able to combine individual words so as to express the ideas he wants to express, and who is able to observe the form of composition that makes his speech conform to the requirements of the situation, is as well qualified as is (humanly) possible to convey to the listener what he wants to convey.</description>

Cephalus rehearses a dialogue which is supposed to have been narrated in his presence by Antiphon, the half-brother of Adeimantus and Glaucon, to certain Clazomenians.
We had come from our home at Clazomenae to Athens, and met Adeimantus and Glaucon in the Agora.

                <description>This is a &lsquo;science which originated in Islam after Arabic philology and lexicography. It belongs among the philological sciences, because it is concerned with words and the ideas they convey and are intended to indicate.
This is as follows:
 The thing that the speaker intends to convey to the listener through speech may be a perception (tasawwur) regarding individual words which are dependent and on which (something else) depends 1282 and of which one leads to the other.</description>

This post will explain gravitational relativity that deals with the movement of quanta of spacetime (qosts) as galaxies and planets and their subtypes.
The Newtonian and Einsteinian movement Newton described motion coming from an external force as a single movement. Einstein revised this by making it relative to frames of reference, as well as dividing it into smaller parts as tensors (as measuring rod S).</description>

                <description>The usual form of address used among the urban and sedentary population is not the old Mudar language nor the language of the (present-day) Arab Bedouins.
It is another independent language, remote from the language of the Mudar and from the language of presentday Arab Bedouins. It is more remote from the former (than from the latter).
It is an independent language by itself. The fact is attested by the changes it shows, which grammatical scholarship 1353 considers solecisms.</description>

                <description>Parmenides These, Socrates are a few, and only a few of the difficulties if we view ideas as having an an absolute unity.
Anyone against this will deny the very existence of this unity. Even if they do exist, he will say that they must of necessity be unknown to man. He will seem to have reason on his side, and will be very difficult to convince.
A man must be gifted with very considerable ability before he can learn that everything has a class and an absolute essence.</description>

                <description>The word &ldquo;taste&rdquo; is in current use among those who are concerned with the various branches of literary criticism (bayan). It means the tongue&rsquo;s possession of the habit of eloquence. What eloquence is 1380 was explained above.
It is the conformity of speech to the meaning (intended), in every aspect, (and this is achieved) by means of certain qualities that give this (conformity) to the word combinations. An eloquent speaker of the Arabic language chooses the form (of expression) that affords such (conformity) according to the methods and ways of Arab address.</description>

                <description>The more remote urban people are from the Arabic language, the more difficult 1392 it is for them to obtain it.
This is because the student has previously obtained a habit incompatible with the desired Arabic linguistic habit, since he has grown up speaking the sedentary language which was influenced by non-Arab speech to such a degree that, eventually, the original habit of the Arabic language was replaced by another.</description>

We will start at the beginning.
If the One exists, then It will have being. But its being will not be the same with the One. If it were the same, it would not be the being of the One and; nor would the One have participated in being, for the proposition that one is would have been identical with the proposition that one is one;</description>

                <description>The One then is necessarily both at rest and in motion.
The One is at rest since it is in Itself as a Whole.On the contrary, the One which is ever in the Others is never in the same and is therefore never at rest.
The One as a Whole is not a part of Itself. Thus, It cannot be related to Itself in the same way as a whole is related to its part.</description>

                <description>The Arabic language and Arab speech are divided into two branches. (One of them) is rhymed poetry. It is speech with meter and rhyme, which means that every line of it ends upon a definite letter, which is called the &ldquo;rhyme.&rdquo; The other branch is prose, that is, non-metrical speech.
Each of the two branches comprises various sub-branches and ways of speech. Poetry comprises laudatory and heroic 1417 poems and elegies (upon the dead).</description>

                <description>Both poetry and prose work with words, and not with ideas.
The ideas are secondary to the (words). The (words) are basic. The craftsman who tries to acquire the habit of poetry and prose uses words for that purpose. He memorizes appropriate words from Arab speech, so as to be able to employ it frequently and have it on his tongue. Eventually, the habit of the Mudar language becomes firmly established in him.</description>

But in so far as it is affected by other it is otherwise, and being otherwise affected is unlike.

If no effort is made to (convey ideas), (speech) is like &ldquo;dead land&rdquo; (mawat) 1568 which does not count.

Definition of eloquence They say that eloquence is conformity of speech to the requirements of the situation. 1570 Knowledge of the conditions and laws governing the conformity of word combinations to the requirements of the situation is the discipline of eloquence (rhetoric).</description>

                <description>Poetry was the archive of the Arabs, containing their sciences, their history, and their wisdom. 1604
Leading Arabs competed in it. They used to stop at the fair of &lsquo;Ukaz 1605 to recite poetry. Each would submit his product for criticism 1606 to outstanding and intelligent personalities. Eventually, (Arab poets) came to vie in having their poems hung up at the corners of the Holy Sanctuary to which they made pilgrimage, the house of their ancestor Ibrahim (the Ka&rsquo;bah).</description>

                <description>Is the One becoming older and younger than the Others, and the Others being younger and older than the one?
An age gap between two things in the present will still be the same age gap in the future. This is because the future implies that the same amount of timespan is added to both things*.

                <description>For the third time, let us consider: If the One is both one and many and is neither one nor many and experiences time, then it must exist when it is the Real One, but not exist when it is the Illusory One.  But It cannot exist when not existing, nor not exist when existing. Then the One exists sometimes and not exist sometimes, and there is a time when it switches from existence to non-existence.</description>

                <description>1.aa.
But if the One exists, what will happen to the Others?
The Others are not the One, but they participate in the One in a certain way.
Because the others are other than the one inasmuch as they have parts; for if they had no parts they would be simply one.
The parts are related to a whole. A whole is one made up of many. The parts will be parts of the one, for each of the parts is not a part of many, but of a whole.</description>

                <description>1.bb. If the One exists, what must be the affections of the Others?
The one must be distinct from the Others, and the Others distinct from the one.
Why, because there is nothing else beside them which is distinct from both of them; for the expression &lsquo;one and the others&rsquo; includes all things.
Then we cannot suppose that there is anything different from them in which both the one and the others might exist?</description>

                <description>*Superphysics note: Here, Parmenides calls the Illusion as not
 2.a. What is the consequence if the One is not?
&ldquo;The One is not&rdquo; is different and opposed to &ldquo;the not One is not.&rdquo;
If largeness is not, if smallness is not, or anything of that sort, does he not mean, whenever he uses such an expression, that &lsquo;what is not&rsquo; is other than other things?
So when he says &lsquo;If one is not&rsquo; he clearly means, that what &lsquo;is not&rsquo; is other than all others.</description>

                <description>2.b. Let us go back to the beginning, and see the consequences that will follow. If One is not, we ask what will happen in respect of one?
The words &lsquo;is not&rsquo; signify an absence of being. When we say that a thing is not, we mean that it has no existence.Then, that which is not cannot exist.
We said that:
 becoming was the assumption of existence being destroyed was the assumption of non-existence  Then one that is non-existing cannot lose or gain existence.</description>

                <description>2.aa. If the One is an Illusion, what becomes of the Others? The Others become other than each Other, for the only remaining alternative is that they are other than nothing.
They are each Other than one another, as being plural and not singular. If One is an Illusion, then the Others cannot be singular. Instead, every particle of them is infinite in number.
Even if you take the smallest fraction, which seemed one, in a moment, it splits up into many as in a dream.</description>

                <description>2.bb. Once more, let us go back to the beginning, and ask if the one is not, and the others of the one are, what will follow. In the first place, the others will not be one?
Nor will they be many; for if they were many one would be contained in them. But if no one of them is one, all of them are nought, and therefore they will not be many.</description>

 Criminals by Nature  Some few men and women are born with a deranged mind. The cause of their mental derangement is concealed within the defects of their body and glands. Such people can be divided into two main groups.
  The people who are normally very quiet, but in whom truthfulness and doing good to others are against their nature. They derive malevolent pleasure from lying and harming others.</description>

From time immemorial, older palmists used them to show marriage.
Their value in practice is considerable if:
 used up to their limit, and in combination.  But used by themselves, as a hard-and-fast indication of marriage, they will lead to constant error.</description>

                <description>Vicára is “justice” in English. It means “a particular type of mental process to ascertain the &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.
Human actions depend on relative principles. Justice is the truth in this relative world, within society.
The struggle between progressive and regressive forces, between good and evil, is a permanent feature of society. Justice lets the human intellect have an increasing number of opportunities to choose the path of righteousness.

                <description>Preamble
China is one of the countries with the longest history. After 1840, feudal China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country.
The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, created the Republic of China to abolish the feudal monarchy. However, imperialism and feudalism still remained. In 1949, the Communist Party of China finally overthrew imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism, and founded the People’s Republic of China. This transitioned from a new democratic society to a socialist society.</description>

                <description>1  O Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise. 2  And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you do. 3  And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough as a trustee. 4  Allah did not place two hearts inside any man&rsquo;s body. Nor did He make your wives whom you equate with your mothers, your actual mothers.</description>

                <description>In most countries crime is defined with reference to a sense of pápa [vice] and puńya [virtue].
These have their roots in the religions of individual countries.
For example, English people customarily believe that suicide is one of the gravest sins. According to the customary belief of Indians, suicide is a sin, but not a grave one.
The Japanese do not consider suicide to be a sin at all.
That is why the penal codes of these three countries are different.</description>

If they testify, confine them to the homes until death claims them, or Allah makes a way for them.

                <description>Last week, the Philippine media was alarmed at the candidacy of Bongbong Marcos for President for 2022.
Bongbong is the son of dictator Ferdinand Marcos who plunged the country to debt and crisis from 1983 to 1986. Ferdinand was ousted by Cory Aquino, a housewife who had no knowledge of governance. This resulted in coups, disorders, and natural disasters which were only stabilized in 1992 after the election of Fidel Ramos, a military general.</description>

                <description>Sextus Pompeius possessed Sicily and Sardinia, was master at sea, and saw himself at the head of a great multitude of fugitives, and persons devoted to death by proscriptions, whose last hopes depended on their valour. Octavius contended with him, in two very laborious wars; and after a variety of ill success, vanquished him by the abilities of Agrippa.
Most of the conspirators ended their lives in a miserable manner; and it was natural that persons who headed a party, so frequently harrassed by wars, in [88] which no quarter was afforded, should die a violent death.</description>

 strengthen his weaker neighbours weaken his more powerful ones  He should be careful that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall get established there.

He judged that this would make the four main armies being possessed by the partners in the empire, would naturally intimidate one another, and that the inferior armies being too weak to have any thoughts of raising [124] their chiefs to the imperial dignity, their custom of election would be gradually discontinued, and entirely abolished at last.</description>

                <description>IN this period, the Stoics propagated their doctrines in the empire with great popularity; and it seems as if nature herself had been industrious to produce this admirable sect, which resembled those plants the earth causes to spring up in places never visited by the sunbeams.
This sect furnished the Romans with their best emperors; none but Marcus Aurelius could extinguish the remembrance of the first Antonine who adopted him; and we find ourselves affected with a secret pleasure when we speak of this emperor.</description>

 the quality of the soil or the climate  We currently trade with India merely through the silver which we send. The Romans annually had a trade volume with India of about 50,000,000 sesterces in exchange for Indian merchandise
It is Nature itself that produces this effect. The Indians have their arts adapted to their manner of living.</description>

                <description>AMONG the several kings whom the Romans invaded, Mithridates was the only one who made a courageous defence, and exposed them to danger.
His dominions were situated to wonderful advantage for carrying on a war with them= they bordered on the inaccessible countries of mount Caucasus, peopled with savage nations, whom that prince could call to his assistance; they thence extended along the sea of Pontus, which Mithridates covered with his ships, and he was incessantly purchasing new armies of Scythians= Asia was open to his invasions; and he was rich, because his cities, situated on the Pontus Euxinus, carried on an advantageous traffic with nations less industrious than themselves.</description>

                <description>DURING the course of so mighty a prosperity, in which it is usual for mankind to forget themselves, the senate continued to act with the same depth of judgment; and whilst their armies were spreading an universal terror, they would not suffer those to rise who were once depressed.
A tribunal arose which judged all nations= At the close of every war they determined the rewards or punishments which every one had merited= They took away from the vanquished people, part of their lands, and gave them to their allies, in which they did two things; they engaged, in the interests of Rome, princes from whom they had little to fear, and much to hope; and they weakened others from whom they had nothing to hope, and every thing to fear.</description>

                <description>CALICULA succeeded Tiberius, and it was said of him, that there never was a better slave, nor a worse master= and indeed these two circumstances are very consistent; for the same turn of mind which inclines a person to be strongly affected at unlimited power in his sovereign, makes him to be no less in love with it, when he rises to empire himself.
Caligula restored the assemblies of the people, which Tiberius had prohibited; and abolished the arbitrary law and constructions of treason established by that emperor= from which proceeding we may observe, that the beginnings of a bad reign sometimes resemble the conclusion of a good one; for a wicked prince may, from a principle of contradiction to the motives of his predecessor’s conduct, be spirited to actions which the other performed from a virtuous inducement; and we owe to this very principle a number of good as well as bad regulations.</description>

                <description>In Eastern philosophy, there is no such thing as an absolute good and bad. Instead, &lsquo;good&rsquo; is anything that matches one&rsquo;s True Nature, while &lsquo;bad&rsquo; is anything that goes against it. This True Nature is called Tao by the Chinese and Dharma by the Indians.
Being in line or in-sync with one&rsquo;s True Nature is called being &lsquo;dharmic&rsquo;, while being out of sync with it is called &lsquo;adharmic&rsquo;. Thus, the moral system derived from this prefers to classify things as dharmic or adharmic instead of good or bad.</description>

                <description>It was impossible for the republic to be re-established. There was no longer any tyrant, and yet liberty was extinguished because the causes of its destruction still continued to prevent its revival.
The assassins only had a plan of a conspiracy, but did not know how to make it effective. After the assassination, they all retired to the capital. The next day, Lepidus, who was fond of commotions, took the Forum with a band of soldiers.</description>

                <description>SOMETIMES the pusillanimous spirit of the emperors † , and frequently the defenceless state of the empire made the people employ their money to appease the nations that threatened to invade them; but the desired peace could never be effectually purchased, because those who sold it could, whenever they pleased, oblige the Romans to buy it again.
It is much better to hazard an unsuccessful war, than to part with great sums for a precarious peace; for a prince is always suspected when it is known he will make a long resistance before he can be vanquished.</description>

                <description>I think that the sect of Epicurus, which began to be propagated at Rome, towards the close of the republic, was very prejudicial to the minds and genius of the people.
The Greeks had been infatuated with its doctrines long before. Consequently, they were corrupted much earlier than the Romans. Polybius says that oaths, in his time, could not induce any person to place confidence in a Greek, whereas they were considered by a Roman as inviolable obligations upon his conscience.</description>

After the expulsion of the kings, the government became aristocratical= the patrician families only, obtained all the employments and dignities in the * state, and consequently all † honours civil and military.
The patricians being determined to prevent, if possible, the return of the kings, endeavoured to soment the restless principles which now prevailed in the minds of the people; but they did more than they would willingly have done= by attempting to inspire them with a hatred for kings, they fired them with an inordinate thirst for liberty.</description>

                <description>Christianity was established when the empire was declining. The Christians reproached the Pagans for that decay. The Pagans retorted the charge on Christiantiy.
The Christians replied that Dioclesian ruined the empire, by associating his three colleagues because each emperor would be as expensive, and maintained as great armies as could have subsisted had there been but one sovereign.
As a consequence, those who furnished the contributions being unequally proportioned to the number of the receivers, the charges became so excessive that the lands were forsaken by the husbandmen, and for want of cultivation lay waste, and were covered with wild and barren forests.</description>

I am sorry to see Livy strew his flowers on these enormous colossuses of antiquity= I wish he had done like Homer, who neglects embellishing them, and knew so well how to put them in motion.
Besides, what Hannibal is made to speak, ought to have common sense= but if, on hearing the defeat of his brother, he said publicly, that it was the prelude of the ruin of Carthage; could any thing have a greater tendency to drive to despair a people, who had placed their confidence in him, and to discourage an army which expected such high recompences after the war?</description>

A law at that time subsisted, which made it treason to form any injurious attempt against the majesty of the people= Tiberius assumed to himself the interpretation and enforcement of this law, and extended it not only to the cases for which it was originally calculated, but to every conjuncture that could possibly be favourable to his hatred or suspicions.</description>

                <description>WHILST the sovereignty of Rome was confined to Italy, it was easy for the commonwealth to subsist.
Every soldier was also a citizen. Every consul raised an army, and other citizens marched into the field under his successor= as their forces were not very numerous, such persons only were received among the troops, as had possessions considerable enough to make them interested in the preservation of the city.
The senate kept a watchful eye over the conduct of the generals, and did not give them an opportunity of machinating any thing to the prejudice of their country.</description>

Southern nations have every convenience of life, and few of its wants. Nature has given them much, and demands but little.

The equilibrium is maintained by:
 the laziness of the southern nations, and the industry and activity of the north.</description>

                <description>Another consequence of the maxim of waging perpetual war was that the Romans only made peace when they were victorious. Why would they make an ignominious peace with one nation, and afterwards go and invade another?
In this view, their pretensions rose always in proportion to their defeat; by this they surprized the conqueror, and said themselves under a greater necessity of conquering.
Being for ever obnoxious to the most severe vengeance, perseverance and valour became necessary virtues= and these could not be distinguished among them from self-love, from the love of one’s family, of one’s country, and whatever is dearest among men.</description>

                <description>It is difficult to holding on to a newly acquired state. How could the the countries conquered by Alexander the Great remain loyal to his successors?
Alexander became the master of Asia in a few years, and died before completing the task. We would expect his whole empire to rebel. Nevertheless, his successors maintained themselves, and had no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own ambitions.</description>

                <description>Every theory of gravitation has to deal with the problem of the influence, exerted on this force by the motion of the heavenly bodies. The solution is easily deduced from our equations; it takes the same form as the corresponding solution for the electromagnetic actions between charged particles.[4]
I shall only treat the case of a body A, revolving around a central body M, this latter having a given constant velocity p.</description>

                <description>Can we ascribe gravity to a certain state of the aether?
A theory of universal attraction, founded on such an assumption, would take the simplest form if new hypotheses about the aether could be avoided, i.e. if the two states which exist in an electric and a magnetic field, and whose mutual connection is expressed by the well known electromagnetic equations were found sufficient for the purpose.
If further it be taken for granted that only electrically charged particles or ions, are directly acted on by the aether, one is led to the idea that every particle of ponderable matter might consist of two ions with equal opposite charges — or at least might contain two such ions — and that</description>

I use Mossotti&rsquo;s idea which has been afterwards accepted by Wilhelm Weber and Zöllner.
They say every particle of ponderable matter consists of two oppositely electrified particles. Between 2 particles of matter, there will be:</description>

                <description>Commerce has changed through time.
European trade is currently carried on principally from the north to the south. The difference of climate is the cause that the several nations have great occasion for the merchandizes of each other. For example, the liquors of the south, which are carried to the north, form a commerce little known to the ancients. Thus the burden of vessels, which was formerly computed by measures of corn, is at present determined by tons of liquor.</description>

Later, Stokes explained that the aether is dragged by the earth. This made the speed of the aether the same as that of the earth at each point at the earth&rsquo;s surface.
I have extensively worked on these theories. [1].</description>

As long as we do not go outside the domain of consciousness, the notion of time is relatively clear.
We easily distinguish our present sensation from the remembrance of past sensations or the anticipation of future sensations.
When we say that two conscious facts are simultaneous, we mean that they profoundly interpenetrate, so that analysis can not separate them without mutilating them.
For an aggregate of sensations to have become a remembrance capable of classification in time, it must have ceased to be actual.</description>

 are acquired either by capacity or good fortune can be held without either since they are sustained by the ancient laws of religion.  These laws are so powerful. The principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave.
These princes:
 have states and do not defend them, yet they are not taken away have subjects and do not rule them, yet do not rebel  So only such principalities are secure and happy, being supported by powers which the human mind cannot reach.</description>

Or should he always need the assistance of others?
 &ldquo;Self-reliant princes&rdquo; are those who have plenty of men or money to raise an army sufficient to join battle for defense.  &ldquo;Dependent princes&rdquo; are those who always are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls.  Dependent princes should provision and strengthen their towns, and not on try to defend the countryside.</description>

A prince must have his foundations well laid, otherwise he will go to ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new, old, or mixed, are good laws and good arms.
There cannot be good laws if the state is not well-armed. It follows that where they are well-armed they have good laws. The arms with which a prince defends his state are either:</description>

                <description>A &ldquo;constitutional principality&rdquo; emerges when a leading citizen becomes the prince by the favour of his fellow citizens and not by wickedness or violence.
A fortunate cleverness is needed to attain to it, not genius or fortune. Such a principality is obtained either:
 by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles.  These two distinct parties are found in all cities.
 The people do not wish to be ruled or oppressed by the nobles The nobles wish to rule and oppress the people.</description>

                <description>Auxiliaries are the other kind of most useless soldiers. They are employed when a prince needs other forces to aid and defend him.
This was done by Pope Julius most recently. He had poor results from his mercenaries in their attack against Ferrara so he turned to auxiliaries and bargained with Ferdinand, King of Spain, for help with men and soldiers.
These soldiers may be useful and good in themselves, but for the person who calls them in they are always disadvantageous, because by losing, a prince is thoroughly defeated, and by winning, a prince becomes under their control.</description>

We listen to it, and we do not hear it, and we name it &rsquo;the Inaudible.'
We try to grasp it, and do not get hold of it, and we name it &rsquo;the Subtle.'
With these three qualities, it cannot be made the subject of description; and hence we blend them together and obtain &lsquo;The One&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>When Alexander conquered Egypt, they only had an imperfect idea of the Red sea and none of the Indian ocean. They thought it impossible to sail around the Arabian peninsula.
People tried from each side but failed. They said= &ldquo;How can we navigate to the southern coast of Arabia? Cambyses’s army traversed it on the north side and almost entirely perished. Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, sent forces to aid Seleucus Nicator at Babylon and underwent incredible hardships and could march only at night.</description>

                <description>A prince should have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline.
This is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only supports those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank.
When princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states, and the first cause of losing it is to neglect this art.</description>

                <description>Every prince should want to be considered kind and not cruel. Nevertheless, he should take care not to misuse this kindness.
Cruel to be Kind Cesare Borgia was considered cruel. Yet his cruelty calmed the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty.
He was actually much more merciful than the Florentines who permitted Pistoia to be destroyed in order to avoid a reputation for cruelty. Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, should not mind the criticism of cruelty.</description>

It was still and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change. It reaches everywhere yet in no danger of being exhausted! It may be regarded as the Mother of all things.

                <description>How should a prince deal with his subjects and friends?
Many have imagined republics and principalities which have never been seen. How one actually lives is far distant from how one ought to live. Anyone who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner brings about his ruin rather than his preservation. A man who wishes to act entirely in a virtuous way is soon destroyed among so much that is evil in the world.</description>

                <description>THE law of nations which obtained at Carthage, was very extraordinary. All strangers, who traded to Sardinia and towards Hercules’s pillars, this haughty republic sentenced to be drowned.
Her civil polity was equally surprizing. She forbid the Sardinians to cultivate their lands, upon pain of death.
 She increased her power by her riches, and afterwards her riches by her power. She extended herself along the ocean.  The senate of Carthage ordered Hanno to distribute 30,000 Carthaginians from the Strait of Gibraltar as far as Cerne.</description>

                <description>Princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account. They have known gotten their way through cheating. They overcame those who have relied on their word.
There are two ways of winning:
 by the rules  This is suited to men   by force.  This is suited to beasts    If winning by the rules is not sufficient, it is necessary to win by force.</description>

                <description>How can a prince avoid being hated or despised?
If he can succeed with this, then:
 he will have done the best he can, and he need not fear any danger in other criticisms.  He will be hated the most if he:
 is greedy exploits the property and women of his subjects  And so he must avoid doing this.
The majority of men live happily when neither their property nor their honour is threatened28.</description>

 disarmed their subjects kept their subject towns divided by setting up opposing groups encouraged attacks against themselves tried to win over those whom they did not trust in the beginning of their governments built castles destroyed castles  One cannot give a final judgment on all of these unless he has the details of those states.

                <description>In a previous post, we pinpointed the guaranteed collapse of the Philippines to the neoliberal policies of the corrupt Diosdado Macapagal in the early 1960&rsquo;s. He devalued the peso on January 22, 1962 for the sake of easy economic growth. This made borrowing attractive since the currency could be devalued to make debt payments easier at the cost of inflation.
This is what Marcos did to perfection.
If the Philippines of the 1970s were a family with Marcos the father, then he was a father who became so dazzled by foreign money that he sold his house and his children as slaves just to get that money.</description>

So many things now come together to favour a new prince. This is the best time for one. It was necessary for:
 the Israelites to be in chains in order to make the ability of Moses clear the Persians to be oppressed by the Medes in order to discover the greatness of Cyrus the Athenians should be scattered to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus  In order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit now, it was necessary that Italy were reduced to her current conditions.</description>

The weakness of the people and the tyranny of their laws united this immense body. The Roman policy was then to avoid all communication with those nations whom they had not subdued. The fear of carrying to them the art of conquering, made them neglect the art of enriching themselves. They made laws to hinder all commerce with barbarians.</description>

                <description>The actions of a new prince are more critically observed than those of an hereditary one. When princes are seen to be capable, they gain more men and make them more loyal than ancient blood.
This is because men are attracted more by the present than by the past. When they find the present good, they enjoy it and seek no further. They will also strongly defend a prince if he does not fail them in other things.</description>

Soon, the commerce of Europe almost entirely lost. The nobility, who had every where the direction of affairs, were in no pain about it.
The laws of the Visigoths permitted private people to occupy half the beds of great rivers, provided the other half remained free for nets and boats.</description>

                <description>On August 11, 2021, the Philippine Commission on Audit (COA) revealed that ₱67 billion of funds were misused by the Department of Health (DOH). This led to allegations of corruption, as well as a Senate investigation on the procurement activities of the DOH.
In the end, the Senate found a small company which used its connections to close a deal worth billions of pesos. This is what agents and brokers do anyway*.</description>

                <description>Chapter 15: The Masters of the Tao  1  The skillful masters of the Tao in the old times had a subtle and exquisite penetration to comprehend its mysteries. They were also deep as to be beyond men&rsquo;s knowledge. But I will describe them.
 2  They looked :
 shrinking like those who wade through a stream in winter irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them grave like a guest in awe of his host evanescent like ice that is melting away unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.</description>

                <description>Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophy was carried to the west. It pleased the subtile geniuses, who were the virtuosi of those times of ignorance.
The theologians condemned the Jewish notions of lending at interest absolutely and in all cases. Hence commerce, which was the profession only of mean persons, became that of knaves, because whenever a thing is forbidden, which nature permits or necessity requires, those who do it are looked upon as dishonest.</description>

                <description>Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in the middle of August, three months after the US announced a complete withdrawal of its troops.
The fall surprised a lot of people, especially since the US spent 20 years building the country from scratch. It was the job of the Afghan army to defend their country and they were doing a decent job before 2021, despite the corruption of their leaders.
This all changed when Trump announced a withdrawal of the US military by May 1, 2021, a policy which was continued by Biden.</description>

                <description>Chapter 16: Meditation and Fellow-feeling with Everything leads to the Tao  1  The state of nothingness should be brought to the utmost degree.
The state of stillness should be guarded with unwearying vigour.
All things alike go through their processes of activity. Afterwards, they return to their original state.
When plants have displayed their luxuriant growth, they return to their root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness.</description>

Asia and Africa were found, of which only some borders were known; and America, of which we knew nothing.
The Portuguese discovered the southernmost point of Africa. They saw a vast sea, which carried them to India.
Camoens writes about:
 their danger on this sea, the discovery of Mozambique, Melinda, and Calcutta  His poems make us feel something of:

                <description>Spain has derived so many advantages from the American trade.
She drew from the Americas so much gold and silver that we had before. But no one expected that Spain would have misfortunes.
Philip 2nd succeeded Charles 5th. He was obliged to make the celebrated bankruptcy known to all the world. There never was a prince who suffered more from the murmurs, the insolence, and the revolt of troops constantly ill paid.</description>

A society is a spirit-like thing. It cannot be got by active doing.
 He who wins it destroys it. He who holds it in his grasp loses it.   2  The course and nature of things is such that:</description>

This connection is easily brought back up to mind and conversation whenever a terrorist attack occurs, whether it was rooted in Islam or not. Whenever a terrorist attack occurs, the common expectation nowadays is for it to be caused by a disgruntled Muslim.</description>

A baker who bakes a cake designs it as a cake and expects it to be a cake in the end, even if it starts as flour.
 If it turns out to be a pie or a large biscuit, then it does not match its design or plan. In this case, it is called a bad or awful cake and is &lsquo;adharmic&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>Climate change can happen both naturally and articially. In Asia, the most famous incidence of climate change happened in Cambodia wherein an entire large city &ndash; Angkor Wat &ndash; had to be abandoned to nature.
What caused Angkor Wat to fail? Unlike most large cities that are built beside a river, Angkor Wat was built next to a lake. Artificial canals were then built to irrigate the land to grow rice and other crops.</description>

                <description>The entry of the Arabs, Spanish, and Americans into the Maharlika confederation solved some of their problems but also created new ones:
  Corruption   The Spanish conquistadors were naturally corrupt, as seen in the devastation they caused to the Inca and Maya. The only reason why Maharlika was not as devastated was because the natives were maginoo and surrendered after they were defeated. The Inca and Maya, on the other hand, fought until they were nearly wiped out by war and disease.</description>

                <description>A major topic of political debate in the Philippines that often crops up every election period is whether there were Golden Years during the Marcos era.
 Liberals, left-wingers, and members of the mainstream religion say that there were no Golden Years because Marcos was a corrupt tyrant who impoverished the nation Conservatives, right-wingers, and traditional politicians would say that there were Golden Years under Marcos and that the country could have prospered if Marcos had continued his rule  To resolve this debate in a logical, data-driven way, we shall analyze the Marcos era and the causes and effects of his policies.</description>

                <description>Anyone who views all of human history will see that democracy is a recent and tiny political phenomenon originating from the American and French Revolutions.
Western democracy originally came from the Greeks. There were other democratic societies in Asia and tribal regions, but they didn&rsquo;t survive because of the inherent problems inherent in democracy, mainly the weakness and instability that it creates.
 Greece was quickly overrun by the Persians who did not have democracy.</description>

                <description>EDSA traffic can never be solved just as Bangkok’s traffic can never be solved — because its design does not match its current use.
An example of a city with a wrong design is Bangkok. It has the worst traffic because its roads are arbitrary and traces the canals which were used to demarcate private property. Such property was not designed to maximize the flow of transportation, but were created arbitrarily.</description>

                <description>Supermalls in the Philippines are the product of Henry Sy when he built SM North Edsa in the 1980&rsquo;s. Back then, malls took the form of department stores such as Isettan in Cubao.
Sy&rsquo;s innovation was to add an airconditioned environment to the usual area of retail shops. This made shopping cool, clean, and convenient, which is a major improvement in polluted urban centers.
The trend of rising power rates arising from the evil privatization of electricity and water made malls even more appealing.</description>

                <description>The Influence of Nature David Hume explained, in &ldquo;National Characters&rdquo;, that the natural environment of a society plays are role in its behavior. If a person were shaped by nature and nurture, then a society&rsquo;s character is likewise shaped by its natural environment and the social cycles that nurture it.
Lord Bacon observed that the inhabitants of the warm south are generally more ingenious than those of the cold north. But where the native of a cold climate has genius, he rises to a higher pitch than can be reached by the southern wits.</description>

                <description>David Hume&rsquo;s Ideal Commonwealth shows a federalized plan of government unified under an executive senate and a representative legislature. It includes an election system that is based on votes from the representatives instead of popular votes.
In Lectures on Jurisprudence, Adam Smith shows the advantages of the Swiss voting system:
When there are 100 votes and three candidates A, B, and C, the most odious candidate might get elected. There might be 34 votes for A,and 33 for B, and 33 for C.</description>

                <description>130  The educational institutions for the youth may generate a revenue to defray their own expence.
The fee or honorary which the scholar pays the teacher is naturally a revenue of this kind.
 131  Even if the teacher&rsquo;s reward does not come from this natural revenue, it still is unnecessary that it should be derived from the society&rsquo;s general revenue.
In most countries, the collection and application of the society&rsquo;s general revenue is done through the executive power.</description>

                <description>181  The common people have little time to spare for education.
Their parents cannot afford to maintain them even in infancy. As soon as they are able to work, they must get employment to earn their subsistence.
That employment is generally so simple and uniform. It gives little exercise to the understanding. Their labour is so constant and so severe.
It leaves them little leisure and less inclination to think of anything else.</description>

The proprietors of the tolls for a high road might neglect road repairs yet continue to levy the same tolls. Therefore, their tolls should be managed by commissioners or trustees.
 79  In Great Britain, the abuses of the trustees in managing those tolls were very justly complained of in many cases.</description>

                <description>There are three solutions to over-importing:
1. Loans The deficit country could be given a loan.
This is always the easiest, though not always the most satisfactory way out. Non-industrialized countries that seek development should resort to loans. But loans should not be made if they would not lead to the necessary adjustments in their respective structures of production.
Balance should be the watchword. International loans, which allow a (justifiable) long-term lack of balance, should be the exception.</description>

                <description>111  The South Sea Joint Stock Company never had any forts or garrisons to maintain.
It was entirely exempted from a great expence. But they had an immense capital divided among so many proprietors.
Folly, negligence, and profusion naturally prevailed in their management. The knavery and extravagance of their stock-jobbing projects are sufficiently known. Explaining those projects would be off-topic.
Their mercantile projects were not much better conducted.</description>

                <description>99  The fee for admission into the Turkey Company was formerly:
 £25 for all persons under 26 years old, and £50 for all persons above 26 years old.  Only mere merchants could be admitted.
This restriction excluded all shop-keepers and retailers.
By a bylaw, British manufactures could be exported to Turkey only on the company&rsquo;s ships.
 Those ships always sailed from the expensive port of London.</description>

                <description>Inflation surged in the second half of 2021 as the effect from the Covid which began in Q1 of 2020.
Covid forced the world to go on lockdown. Without a normal economy going, people started buying cryptocurrencies and NFTs with their savings (retail money). This caused a surge in the crypto prices. The money that was supposed to go to circulate the real economy was funneled into a virtual casino that inflated crypto prices without producing any real utility.</description>

                <description>The previous post explained the problem with the Keynesian Dutertenomics, which is embodied in the neoliberal economic plan called &ldquo;Ambisyon 2040&rdquo; by Arsenio Balisacan.
Society Subsidizing the Rich The main flaw of that plan was that it catered to the merchant class of society and neglected the other 3 classes . That class is made up of business and monied interests.
   Class Socratic Name Hindu Name Example     Merchants Oligarchs &ldquo;The Few&rdquo; Vaesya Businessmen, Banks, Traders   Populists Democrats &ldquo;The Many&rdquo; Shudra Workers, Employees, General labor (Farm labor, fishermen, maids, etc)   Militants Tyrants Ksattriya Government, Military, Police   Philosophers Aristocrats &ldquo;The Best&rdquo; Brahmin Universities, Researchers, Inventors, Religions    A society needs all 4 classes to be in good shape just as a human body needs all its organs working properly.</description>

Confucius: The Yin dynasty adopted the rules and manners of the Hu line of kings. It is possible to tell whether it retrograded or advanced. The Chow line has followed the Yin and adopted its ways. Whether there has been deterioration or improvement may also be determined. Some other line may take up in turn those of Chow.</description>

                <description>The Jews at the time of Moses were torn between two sides:
 those who wanted to stay comfortably in Egypt as slaves and employees  These are the left-wing or liberals   those who wanted to be independent and leave Egypt  These are the right-wing or nationalists    Right-wing Moses A right-wing leader named Moses emerged and brought them out of Egypt and formed the God Party with its Ten Commandments as its Constitution which was forced onto all 12 Tribes even on the Levites.</description>

                <description>Many liberals advocate the self-regulation as an alternative to regulation by governments and institutions. They usually borrow passages from Adam Smith who said that the government should not lay its hand on the freedom of individuals to act as they see fit. They say that invisible hand of self-interest is much better at regulating the self:
Every individual works to render the society’s annual revenue as great as he can. He generally does not intend to promote the public interest.</description>

                <description>Feudalism is a way of controlling huge land areas where each land is divided into fiefs under a lord who is under a king, who is really the strongest lord. Thus, it can be viewed as a delegated way of governance.
Forms of feudalism were practiced in Persia, India, and Turkey. The opposite of feudalism is the republican city-states of Greece and Rome.
Feudalism&rsquo;s key characteristic is that the land stays with the nobility&rsquo;s family forever and is not subdivided.</description>

                <description>The Englightenment From the time of Plato and Aristotle up to Kant, philosophy dominated the study of human knowledge in the West. It included metaphysics and was only countered, or offset, by religion:
 Socrates was countered by Hesiod Copernicus was countered by the Church  A similar pattern existed in Asia:
 Buddhism was countered by Hinduism and Vedanta Taoism was countered by Confucianism  Science was then called Natural Philosophy which dealt with natural physical phenomena which were put under metaphysical principles.</description>

                <description>Maharlikanism is a set of solutions to overhaul, either gradually or totally, Philippines into Maharlika.
It is an implementation of our proposed Social Superphysics which aims overhaul the current unsustainable economic and political systems which were established by colonialism and the industrial revolution.
You could say that while the current systems had mercantilist and industrial roots, the systems from Social Superphysics has its roots in the internet and the Enlightenment. This makes it responsive, flexible, cooperative, democratic, and universal.</description>

                <description>Ferdinand Marcos was the dictator who used Maharlika for nationalist or political purposes, as part of his utopian Bagong Lipunan (New Society). This includes naming his projects as Maharlika:
 Maharlika Hall is the reception area of the Malacanang Palace Maharlika Highway is a major road network Maharlika Village is a Muslim village created by Marcos in 1974 for the army and Moro elite  Our version of Maharlika is totally different.</description>

 Blue Red White  Metaphysically, this manifests as the divisions between Filipinos. Instead of unity, each Filipino associates with his own tribe or dialect such as Tagalog, Bisaya, Tausug, Ilocano, etc.
To unify Filipnos, we propose a Maharlikan flag made up of=
 1 golden sun with 8 rays - This represents the Supreme Entity, whether as God, Allah, Brahma, etc.</description>

                <description>Maharlika was the name of the pre-colonial confederation based in the city of Manila.
 Maha means great, such as Maharashtra and Mahabharata. It adds r when it is conjugated Lika either means:  creation from Tagalog &ldquo;likha&rdquo; which in Sanskrit means to draw or paint cup in Sanskrit, made up of la (cup) ika (small, feminine)*     *Pottery was among the first industries of mankind. Among the creation myths of the country is the supreme god Bathala creating Maharlikans from heated clay which ended up &ldquo;just right&rdquo;, not being too dark like the Negritos nor too light as the East Asians.</description>

                <description>Creation is mixed, being made up of necessity and mind.
Mind is the ruling power. It persuaded necessity to bring the greater part of created things to perfection. This created the universe when the influence of reason got the better of necessity.
But if a person will truly tell of the way in which the work was accomplished, he must include the other influence of the variable cause as well. Wherefore, we must return again and find another suitable beginning, as about the former matters, so also about these.</description>

Unlike normal definitions of society*, our definition describes a society* as a kind of metaphysical organism or mind that is made up of individual minds that agree to be part of that society.</description>

                <description>Hunter-Gatherer Scenario Figure 1. A single hunter who consumes all the work of his industry   This scenario illustrates the DCTI model in the simplest form without trade. To meet the hunger (demand) of the hunter, he must gather his equipment and skill (capital) to hunt an animal (industry), which he will consume to satisfy his hunger.
Advancing Society Scenario Figure 2. A simple scenario illustrating how societies get wealthier through time   It starts with fixed capital (light blue bar), unlike the hunter-gatherer scenario which had none.</description>

 The 2008 Financial crisis was caused by securitization unnaturally increasing industry on paper The Asian Financial Crisis was caused by hot money unnaturally increasing industry in Asia. This led to non-performing loans Black Wednesday in 1992 was caused by John Major overvaluing the pound to promote a rosy British industry.</description>

                <description>The Modern Economic Table is a flowchart invented by Francois Quesnay of the Physiocrats in the 18th century.
They say that it serves as data-driven proof of how real wealth is generated from agriculture and mining instead of from manufacturing and services which merely add value.
Of course, this is not totally true. It is true that raw materials and agriculture create value from scratch, as coming from Mother Nature. But the value added by manufacturing and services might just be as valuable, or even more valuable than the initial value created from Nature.</description>

                <description>A previous post explained how the error in Einstien&rsquo;s E = mc^2 led to the universal equation of Superphysics.
By fixing Einstein&rsquo;s error, the speed of light no longer becomes a constant. Without this constant, the principles of motion no longer gets a sequential or linear speed limit. They can now extend onto the metaphysical dimension where motion manifests as the movement of minds and feelings which are never constant nor strictly linear by nature.</description>

                <description>While collating the works of Socrates in order to unify them with those of David Hume to harmonize Superphysics, I came upon his maxims on astrophysics: The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge. Any geometrician who saw them would never think that there is a true equal, true double, or true proportion in the spangled heavens. Likewise, a true astronomer..will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, the stars to one another are eternal and subject to no deviation.</description>

                <description>The lashing of Hurricane Ida, the floods in China, and forest fires in Siberia and Europe has made the impact of global warming obvious to all. Unfortunately, policymakers seem to have no other solution to it other than:
 reducing CO2 emissions through a carbon tax, anti-emission regulations, or green energy building infrastracture as new dams, roads, and bridges that can withstand natural disasters better  However, despite lobbying by various parties and governments, such solutions still are not implemented due to their cost or impracticality.</description>

                <description>The failure of quantitative easing, both in the US under Obama and in Japan as Abenomics , is proof that the operations of banking cannot directly and immediately lead to economic growth, as explained by Adam Smith:
The judicious operations of banking can increase a country’s industry, not by augmenting the country’s capital, but by rendering most of that capital productive.

                <description>The inelastic supply curve is the child-idea of the sophistry called the Equilibrium Theory of Economics. It manifests as a vertical line that says* that an essential, but hard-to-produce product can command whatever price its supplier wants.
 *Samuelson refers to it as the inelastic supply curve, while Case and Fair, and Roger Miller refer to it as the inelastic demand curve
 If the amount supplied is perfectly fixed, as in perishable fish for sale at whatever price, we face the perfectly inelastic supply.</description>

                <description>According to Socrates, all societies have alternating cycles that begin with democracy that switches to tyranny, then aristocracy, then oligarchy, and finally back to democracy.
 A democracy is dominated by working-class people. Its positive aspect is social justice, while its negative is chaos and mob rule. This chaos leads people to want order, paving the way for tyranny A tyranny is dominated by warriors, leaders, and generals. Its positive aspect is peace and order, while its negative is abuse and corruption.</description>

It may oblige some citizens of military age to become soldiers, in addition to their current profession. It may do this through a very rigorous police, despite the people&rsquo;s contrary interest, genius, and inclinations. 18 This method forms a militia

                <description>27  History shows the superiority of a well-regulated standing army over a militia.
Philip of Macedon  28  The army of Philip of Macedon is one of the first standing armies documented.
In the beginning, his troops were probably a militia.
 Frequent wars with the Thracians, Illyrians, Thessalians, and some Greek cities near Macedon gradually formed his troops to the exact discipline of a standing army. He was careful not to disband that army when he was at peace, which was very seldom.</description>

                <description>The fall of the western empire is the third great revolution in ancient history.
 It was caused by the superiority of the militia of a barbarous nation over the militia of a civilized nation. It is the superiority of the militia of shepherd nations over the militia a nation of husbandmen, artificers, and manufacturers.  The victories gained by militias were, not over standing armies, but over other militias inferior in exercise and discipline.</description>

                <description>46  &ldquo;Civil government supposes a certain subordination.&rdquo;
The necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property. Likewise, the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property.
 47  Four causes naturally introduce subordination:
 The superiority of personal qualifications The superiority of age The superiority of fortune The superiority of birth    48  1.</description>

This inequality:
 introduces a new degree of authority and subordination through a civil government   contributes very much to maintain and secure that authority.  The rich need to secure their own advantages and so they support a government.
 Poorer men combine to defend the property of richer men so that those richer men may combine to defend the property of the poorer men.</description>

                <description>63  The whole expence of justice might be easily defrayed by the fees of court.
The public revenue might thus be discharged from a small incumbrance without exposing justice to corruption.
When the sovereign has a share in the fees of court, it is:
 difficult to regulate the fees effectively, and difficult for the sovereign to derive any considerable revenue from them.  It is very easy where the judge is the principal person who can reap any benefit from the fees.</description>

 forward contracts will not be transferrable private currency trading will not be allowed  The job of providing liquidity and transferring working capital to the producers and exporters will be done instead by clearing funds.
But how will the system work for overseas investments?

Instead, he wanted to prove that it is the money price of some rude produce relative to the main food grain (such as wheat), which is the clearest indicator of a society&rsquo;s wealth or poverty.</description>

Such words then force the other side to do research on what those jargon mean. This can potentially waste a lot of time since there are a lot of fallacies.
These fallacies were merely created by academics for the sake of creating something, just as mathematicians create paradoxes, and theoretical physicists create useless theories because thinking is part of their job.</description>

                <description>Summary: Business is based on money which really is just quantitative information. It is unable to carry qualitative information such as morality. Contracts, on the other hand, can carry such information and are a better foundation of the economy.
 In some societies, especially Eastern ones, business is usually looked down upon. In ancient China and Japan, merchants were not respected and were even oppressed.
In fact, both China and Japan closed off their doors to foreign trade.</description>

                <description>Japan has been suffering from chronic deflation since 1991 after the bursting of their asset price bubble. This is similar in pattern to the secular stagnation in the US after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both problems persist because they have been given the wrong solutions in the form of &ldquo;quantitative easing&rdquo; (QE) in the US, and &ldquo;Abenomics&rdquo; in Japan.
What is Abenomics? Abenomics is a set of economic policies organized into three arrows:</description>

                <description>Another flawed economic paradigm, aside from the Steady State Economy is the Resource Based Economy (RBE) by Jacque Fresco . It is implemented as The Venus Project which is a tech-urban master plan. This is a necessary consequence of Mr. Fresco being a designer by trade, as opposed to being a practicing scientist or civil engineer.
  Its most striking feature is that it aims to distribute goods and services without using:</description>

                <description>A couple named Don Juan and Namongan lived in a faraway barrio of Nalbuan. One day, Don Juan left his pregnant wife and went to the mountain to punish a group of Igorots.
While he was in the mountain, Namongan gave birth to a baby boy. The baby was different from other babies because upon birth he could already speak. He wanted his name to be Lam-ang. And he was the one who chosed his godfather when he was baptized.</description>

1. a. Advanced tech The colonizers came with advanced technologies and useful goods that were coveted by the natives. For example, Pigafetta writes that the Spanish explorers to the Philippines exchanged their tools for much-needed food:</description>

                <description>According to Socrates, all societies have alternating seasons that begin with democracy that switches to tyranny, then aristocracy, then oligarchy, and finally back to democracy.
 A democracy is dominated by freedom-loving people. Its positive aspect is social justice, while its negative is chaos and mob rule. This chaos leads people to want order, paving the way for tyranny A tyranny is dominated by warriors and generals. Its positive aspect is peace and order, while its negative is abuse and corruption.</description>

 We left Spain on Monday morning 1519 with 237 men.
Samar (under Sulu?) At dawn on Saturday, March 16 1521, we came upon Samar island 300 leagues from Ladroni [The Marianas].
 The next day, Magellan had two tents set up on the shore for the sick, and had a sow killed for them.</description>

Near that island of Cebu was an island called Mactan, which formed the port where we were anchored. The name of its village was Mactan, and its chiefs were Zula and Cilapulapu. That city which we burned was in that island and was called Bulaia.

                <description>The Atlantic wrote an article about General Pershing in the Philippines as part of the American pacification campaign.
The American system works for civilized humans that have transplanted themselves into uninhabited, uncivilized land, such as North America. It would be the best system for Australia, Alaska, Antarctica, Greenland, and Mars (being done by the American named Elon Musk).
The problem is that the Philippines already had a civilization prior to the Spanish and American period.</description>

                <description>Superphysics is based on waves which need linear algebra to notate and compute. Moverover, no wave exists alone - all waves and even parts of the same wave are analogous or relative to another. This is different from particles which are discrete and can exist all alone.

 Basic Universal Revenue (BUR) for creating basic value as food Resource Credits (RC) for keeping companies afloat and avoiding bankruptcy  Both BUR and RC have a common denominator which is their values are pegged to rice so that BUR is in ultimately in grams of rice just as RC is in kilos of rice or wheat.</description>

                <description>In 1772, a credit crisis originating in London hit and spread over Europe and affected the American colonies.
The cause was the creation and over-circulation of bounced checks then known as redrawn bills of exchange. Speculators used these bills to gamble with bank money and the deposits of other people. The end result was a loss of capital, creating a credit crunch, which led to an economic downturn hitting Europe and too-big-to-fail companies.</description>

                <description>The intention of this Appendix is to give some more particular explication of the origin and nature of Justice, and to mark some differences between it and the other virtues.
The social virtues of humanity and benevolence exert their influence immediately by a direct tendency or instinct, which chiefly keeps in view the simple object, moving the affections, and comprehends not any scheme or system, nor the consequences resulting from the concurrence, imitation, or example of others.</description>

                <description>It is very common for philosophers to=
 encroach on the province of grammarians engage in disputes of words, while they imagine that they are handling controversies of the deepest importance and concern.  It was in order to avoid frivolous altercations that I endeavoured to state with the utmost caution the object of our present enquiry;
I proposed to list mental qualities which are=
 the object of love or esteem, and form a part of personal merit; and on the other hand, a catalogue of those the object of censure or reproach, and which detract from the character of the person possessed of them; subjoining some reflections concerning the origin of these sentiments of praise or blame.</description>

                <description>There would be no need for governments or political society if everyone could observe justice and equity and had the strength of mind to resist present pleasure and advantage.
In such a case of natural justice, we would not need any positive laws. There would be no need for magistrates when there is never any disorder.
When a number of political societies are erected, and maintain a great intercourse together, a new set of rules are immediately discovered to be USEFUL in that particular situation; and accordingly take place under the title of Laws of Nations.</description>

                <description>Part 1 It seems so natural a thought to ascribe to their utility the praise, which we bestow on the social virtues, that one would expect to meet with this principle everywhere in moral writers, as the chief foundation of their reasoning and enquiry.
In common life, we may observe, that the circumstance of utility is always appealed to; nor is it supposed, that a greater eulogy can be given to any man, than to display his usefulness to the public, and enumerate the services, which he has performed to mankind and society.</description>

Let us suppose that nature has bestowed on the human race such profuse ABUNDANCE of all EXTERNAL conveniencies, that, without any uncertainty in the event, without any care or industry on our part, every individual finds himself fully provided with whatever his most voracious appetites can want, or luxurious imagination wish or desire.</description>

The epithets sociable, good-natured, humane, merciful, grateful, friendly, generous, beneficent, or their equivalents, are known in all languages. They universally express the highest merit, which HUMAN NATURE can attain.
People who have these amiable qualities joined with abilities which lead to the good government or education of mankind are seen as somewhat divine. The following qualities might expose a hero or politician to the public&rsquo;s envy:</description>

                <description>A man&rsquo;s property is anything which it is lawful for him, and for him alone, to use. but what rule have we, by which we can distinguish these objects?
Here we must have recourse to statutes, customs, precedents, analogies, and a hundred other circumstances; some of which are constant and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary.
But their ultimate goal is the interest and happiness of human society.
Where this enters not into consideration, nothing can appear more whimsical, unnatural, and even superstitious, than all or most of the laws of justice and of property.</description>

                <description>All ancient moralists say that physical beauty is like a beautiful mind. We both praise a handsome man and a man with a beautiful mind.
One considerable source of BEAUTY in all animals is the advantage which they reap from the particular structure of their limbs and members, suitably to the particular manner of life, to which they are by nature destined. The just proportions of a horse, described by Xenophon and Virgil, are the same that are received at this day by our modern jockeys; because the foundation of them is the same, namely, experience of what is detrimental or useful in the animal.</description>

                <description>A sad group of people sometimes has a lively member who suddenly animates their conversation. Such a cheerfulness carries great merit with it and most more readily communicates itself all around. The flame spreads through the whole circle; and the most sullen and morose are often caught by it.
Horace says that sad people hate happy people. However, I do not believe so. I see that serious people are more delighted where the happiness is moderate and decent.</description>

                <description>[Footnote= The natural definition of virtue is a quality of the mind agreeable to or approved of by every one who considers or contemplates it. Some qualities produce pleasure because they are useful to society or to the person himself, Other qualities produce pleasure more immediately. This is the case with the class of virtues here.]
The mutual shocks in SOCIETY and the oppositions of interest and ego have constrained mankind to establish the laws of JUSTICE, in order to preserve the advantages of mutual assistance and protection.</description>

                <description>PART 1 IT is surprising that any man in so late an age, should find it requisite to prove, by elaborate reasoning, that Personal Merit consists altogether in the possession of mental qualities, USEFUL or AGREEABLE to the PERSON HIMSELF or to OTHERS.
It might be expected that this principle would have occurred even to the first rude, unpractised enquirers concerning morals, and been received from its own evidence, without any argument or disputation.</description>

                <description>Part 2 Why do we agree to moral obligations?
Though the philosophical truth of any proposition by no means depends on its tendency to promote the interests of society; yet a man has but a bad grace, who delivers a theory, however true, which, he must confess, leads to a practice dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into those corners of nature which spread a nuisance all around? Why dig up the pestilence from the pit in which it is buried?</description>

                <description>Descartes has an Irregular Imagination I am unjust in blaming the for:
 using the imagination, and allowing themselves to be entirely guided by the imagination in their reasonings.  There are two kinds of imagination:
 the imagination based on permanent, irresistible, and universal principles  Examples are the habitual transition from causes to effects, and from effects to causes. These are the foundation of all our thoughts and actions.</description>

                <description>This week, Minneapolis voted to replace its Police force with Community-based law enforcement. The reasoning is that their police force was abusive and ineffective.
However, from the nature of things, this is the wrong solution. If you had a personal chauffer (driver) who was reckless and has caused the deaths of others, you do not ban all chauffers and make people drive their own cars. Some people might suggest re-training the chauffers to make them more careful.</description>

                <description>The tech world was abuzz with the word artificial intelligence or AI in 2016 after Google released Tensorflow in late 2015.
AI is a big field which includes machine learning and data mining. Many startup companies market themselves as being AI-based. Most of the time, they just use a machine learning algorithm to produce different outputs which might not be useful.
What&rsquo;s wrong with artificial? The problem is that intelligence is merely the ability to connect ideas.</description>

                <description>While simplifying Adam Smith&rsquo;s Theory of Moral Sentiments, I had to think a lot whether to change &lsquo;sentiments&rsquo; into &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; especially since the latter is nowadays more commonly used than the former.
Feelings vs Sentiments &lsquo;Sentiment&rsquo; is Latin for feeling.
&lsquo;Feeling&rsquo; is Old English for the ability of the heart to perceive, as opposed to:
 &lsquo;sight&rsquo;, the ability of the eye &rsquo;think&rsquo;, the ability of the brain &lsquo;hearing&rsquo;, the ability of the ear  Thus, &lsquo;sentiment&rsquo;, being Latin, is merely more formal and scientific than &lsquo;feelings&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>*This post emphasizes workarounds like Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, Ivermectin, etc because it was written when vaccines were unavailable. Vaccination is the best workaround as it &lsquo;schools&rsquo; the immune system on how to deal with viruses and since the policy of Medical and Social Superphysics is &lsquo;prevention is better and cheaper than cure&rsquo;.
 The Corona virus disease began in January in Wuhan, China just before the Lunar New Year. At that time, it bore all the signs of SARS and so the world was not so alarmed, as China and Hongkong already had experience with such an epidemic.</description>

                <description>Hume was very much against shallow, unenlightened philosophers who wrote a lot of nonsense.
Kant is one such philosopher.
Hume already said that there was no such thing as a priori knowledge, but Kant refuted this by saying some were a priori. In reality, Kant was referring to belief and not knowledge.
Major Difference 1: A Priori; Belief Versus Knowledge There are a priori beliefs that you do not know where it came from (like why Person 1 likes chocolate instead of crisps, but Person 2 likes crisps instead of chocolate)</description>

                <description>In a previous post, we defined moral as a quality that produces happiness for now and for as long as possible, for the self and for as many entities as possible.
The problem is that the Negative Force (the force that is tasked to create reality) is designed to limit and compress things. This limitation is seen in the ego in actively-conscious entities*.
 *It is actually strongest in non-living (non-actively-conscious) entities.</description>

                <description>People have loved money ever since it was invented. The philosophers David Hume and Socrates, on the other hand, were not so keen on money because of its drawbacks, which we distill into three:
1. Money builds ego Having a lot of money gives theego power over other egos, giving a feeling of superiority to the monied-ego, leading to arbitrary actions which encroaches on other egos, creatinginjusticeand eventually,evil.
A dirt-poor evil bum can hurt a few people, but an ultra rich evil man can hurt so many.</description>

                <description>Universal Basic Income (UBI) became popular in 2016 after it was adopted by a few Western countries.
In UBI, money is given to poor people without any strings attached. This makes it a bit different from Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) which imposes conditions that the poor must meet.
What&rsquo;s Wrong with Universal Basic Income? In general, studies have found two flaws in UBI:
 It contributes little to alleviate poverty as a whole It is expensive to administer  Adam Smith, the founder of Economics, would be against UBI because:</description>

                <description>The social end result of the journey from nominal to real to natural value is therefore market value.
   Step Value Example Incentive     1 Nominal Woman wants a cake    2 Real Man skilled in cakes bakes a cake Primary Arbitrage   3 Market Man sells the cake to the woman and others Secondary Arbitrage   4 Natural Support, Competition, or Regulations sustain cake-making     From Primary Arbitrage to Secondary Arbitrage In the past, this was done through barter, giving more power to real value, the primary producers, and primary arbitrage.</description>

                <description>Our proposed moral system, derived from Adam Smith, David Hume, and Socrates, is based on a clear definition of morality as happiness for the most entities possible for the longest time possible.
The &ldquo;most entities possible&rdquo; encompasses moral space, while &ldquo;for the longest time possible&rdquo; encompasses moral time. The end goal of maximizing moral space and time, by specifying &ldquo;most&rdquo; and &ldquo;longest&rdquo;, is the attainment of the state of peace. This ultimate state then answers the purpose of creation and closes the loop of existence.</description>

                <description>The Consumer is King The consumption or demand motive is one of the most important maxims of Adam Smith&rsquo;s economic system, aside from the Effort Theory of Value . This maxim states that all economic activity is rooted in the people or the demanders in society and not in the producers or suppliers.
This is easily seen in the concept of the human family which is the smallest and most common type of society.</description>

                <description>Currently, Jose Rizal is the national hero of the Philippines because of his martyrdom. Compared to the other revolutionaries and nationalists, Rizal was rich and highly educated.
 Unlike Marcelo del Pilar, he did not die of poverty from his activities Unlike Andres Bonifacio, he was able to publish his views extensively  However, the main problem with Rizal was that he did not believe that the Philippines should be fully independent from Spain.</description>

                <description>AFTER the Franks left their own country, they compiled the Salic laws with the help of their own sages. The Ripuarian Franks under Clovis joined the Salians and preserved its own customs. Theodoric, king of Austrasia, ordered them to be written. He also collected the customs of those Bavarians and Germans who were dependent on his kingdom.
Germany was weakened by the migration of so many people. The Franks conquered all before them.</description>

They exchange their salt for gold. The Moor puts his salt in a heap. The Negro puts his gold dust in another. If there is not gold enough, the Moor takes away some of his salt, or the Negro adds more gold, until both parties are agreed.</description>

                <description>12  The amount of commodities human industry can buy or produce is naturally regulated by the effective demand in every country.
The effective demand is the demand of the people who are willing to pay the rent, labour, and profits needed to make them and bring them to market.
Gold and silver are the commodities which best regulate themselves most exactly to this effective demand. They are most easily transported from where they are cheap, to where they are dear.</description>

 their authority as their right of property their love, reason, and the uncertainty of that of their children, whom youth confines in a state of ignorance, and passion in a state of ebriety.  In the small republics, or singular institutions already mentioned, they might have laws which gave to magistrates that right of inspection over the marriages of the children of citizens, which nature had already given to fathers.</description>

 the Roman law the Theodosian code the different laws of the Barbarians, who settled in those parts.  Under the Franks, the Salic law was established for the Franks, and the Theodosian code for the Romans.
In that subject to the Visigoths, a compilation of the Theodosian code, made by order of Alaric, regulated disputes among the Romans;
the national customs which Euric caused to be reduced into writing, determined those among the Visigoths.</description>

                <description>19  People say that:
Consumable commodities are soon destroyed, but gold and silver are more durable. If not continually exported, gold and silver might be accumulated for ages to increase the country's real wealth. It is most disadvantageous for any country to trade such lasting commodities for such perishable ones. However, the exchange of English hardware for French wines is not disadvantageous, even if hardware is a very durable commodity.</description>

                <description>Population policy depends greatly on circumstances. There are countries, in which nature does all.
There is no need to encourage propagation when a fruitful climate yields enough people. Sometimes, the climate is more favourable than the soil. The people multiply, and are destroyed by famine.
This is the case of China. Hence a father sells his daughters, and exposes his children. In Tonkin, the same causes produce the same effects. so we need not, like the Arabian travellers mentioned by Renaudot, search for the origin of this in their sentiments on the metempsychosis.</description>

                <description>The law of the Lombards was impartial. The Romans were under no temptation to quit their own for it.
The motive which prevailed with the Romans under the Franks to make choice of the Salic law, did not take place in Italy; hence the Roman law maintained itself there, together with that of the Lombards.
It even fell out, that the latter gave way to the Roman institutes, and ceased to be the law of the ruling nation; and though it continued to be that of the principal nobility, yet the greatest part of the cities formed themselves into republics, and the nobility mouldered away of themselves, or were destroyed.</description>

                <description>THE Romans, by destroying others, were themselves destroyed. Through incessant action they wore out like a weapon kept constantly in use.
How did the Romans increase their population?
Chapter 21: Roman Population Laws THE ancient laws of Rome tried hard to get people to marry. Dio says that Augusus said:
Dionysius Halicarnasseus† cannot believe that after the death of 305 of the Fabii, exterminated by the Veientes, there remained no more of this family but one child; because the ancient law, which obliged every citizen to marry and to educate all his children‡, was still in force.</description>

                <description>31  The importation of gold and silver is not the sole benefit from foreign trade. All nations derive two benefits from it:
 It carries out their surplus produce which has no demand at home It brings back something else for which there is a demand.  Foreign trade gives a value to their nations&rsquo; superfluities by exchanging them for something else.
The narrowness of the home market limits a country&rsquo;s division of labour.</description>

                <description>THE Salic, the Ripuarian, Burgundian, and Visigoth laws, gradually became disused among the French.
Fiefs became hereditary and arriere-fiefs extended. Many usages were introduced which made these laws obsolete. Disputes were still regulated by fines. But the value of money changed and so the fines were also changed.
France was divided into petty lordships, which acknowledged feudal dependence which made it very difficult for only one law to be authorised. Officers could no longer be sent into the provinces to inspect the administration of justice and political affairs.</description>

                <description>THE Roman policy was very good in respect to abortion. Dionysius Halicarnasseus says that Romulus made the citizens educate:
 all their male children the eldest of their daughters.  If the infants were deformed and monstrous, he permitted killing themafter showing them to 5 of their nearest neighbours.
Romulus did not allow killing any infant under 3 years old. He thus reconciled the law that gave to fathers the right of life and death over their children.</description>

                <description>1  The monopoly of domestic industry is secured through high duties or import bans of foreign goods which can be produced at home.
The ban on importing foreign live cattle or foreign salt secures the monopoly of the home market for meat to British graziers.
The high duties on wheat imports amount to a ban in times of moderate plenty. Such duties give a like advantage to wheat growers.</description>

                <description>16  } Merchants and manufacturers derive the greatest advantage from this monopoly of the home-market.
The high duties on foreign wheat amount to a ban in times of moderate plenty. These duties, with the ban on the importation of foreign cattle and salt, are not so advantageous to British graziers and farmers as other bans are to British merchants and manufacturers. Manufactures, especially those of the finer kind, can be more easily transported than wheat or cattle.</description>

                <description>WHEN a state is depopulated by particular accidents, by wars, pestilence, or famine, there are still resources left.
The men who remain may preserve the spirit of industry. They may seek to repair their misfortunes, and calamity itself may make them become more industrious.
This evil is almost incurable, when the depopulation is prepared before-hand by interior vice and a bad government.
When this is the case, men perish with an insensible and habitual disease= born in misery and weakness, in violence, or under the influence of a wicked administration, they see themselves destroyed, and frequently without perceiving the cause of their destruction.</description>

                <description>WHEN the German nations subdued the Roman empire, they learned to write so they imitated the Romans and wrote down their own usages and digested them into codes.
The reign of Charlemagne was followed by=
 unhappy reigns the Norman invasions, and the civil wars.  These plunged the conquering nations again into the darkness and caused reading and writing to be neglected. These led to the written laws of the Barbarians, the Roman law, and the capitularies to fall into oblivion in France and Germany.</description>

                <description>The Salic law did not allow negative proofs. The laws of almost all nations allow the accused to deny the accuser. But the Salic law did not.
The law of the Ripuarian Franks was quite different as it allowed negative proofs. The accused could clear himself by swearing among witnesses that he had not committed the crime. The number of witnesses increased in proportion to the importance of the affair. Sometimes it amounted to 72.</description>

                <description>23  There are two cases when it will be advantageous to lay some burden on foreign industry to encourage domestic industry.
 24  When an industry is needed for national defence. When a tax is imposed by foreign countries on certain products of the home country.
Case 1: National Defence For example, Great Britain&rsquo;s defence depends very much on its sailors and shipping.
The act of navigation very properly gives British sailors and shipping the monopoly of British trade by= absolute prohibitions or heavy burdens on foreign shipping The following are the principal dispositions of this Act.</description>

                <description>40  It may be deliberated how to properly restore the free importation of foreign goods after it has been interrupted, especially when its local monopoly already employs so many people.
In this case, humanity may require that the freedom of trade should be restored slowly, with much reserve and circumspection.
If those high duties and prohibitions were all removed at once, cheaper foreign goods might enter so fast. They would deprive our people of their employment.</description>

                <description>73  In years of scarcity, the distress caused by the strict execution of those laws was probably very great.
But sometimes, its execution was suspended by temporary statutes which allowed wheat imports for a limited time. The necessity of these temporary statutes demonstrates the impropriety of this general one.
 74  These restraints on importation came before the bounty&rsquo;s establishment.
They were dictated by the same spirit and principles of those bounties.</description>

 63  It supposes that when wheat prices rise to 576 pence the quarter, wheat is likely to be so engrossed as to hurt the people.
But it is evident that wheat cannot be so engrossed by the inland dealers to hurt the people. 576 pence the quarter is a very high price. But in years of scarcity, it is the common price immediately after harvest.</description>

They want the most extensive foreign sale for their goods. But their country=
 has no jurisdiction in foreign nations can seldom grant them any monopoly overseas.  They generally petition for encouragements to exportation.
 2  Drawbacks seem the most reasonable of these encouragements.
Drawing back the imposed excise or inland duty upon exportation, can never cause more exportation than if there were no duty.</description>

 73  Except their foreign trade, English colonists had completely liberty to manage their own affairs their own way.
It is equal to the liberty of their fellow-citizens at home. It is secured in the same way by representatives of the people.</description>

                <description>1  In Great Britain, export bounties are frequently petitioned for.
They are sometimes granted to particular domestic industries. Through bounties, our merchants and manufacturers can pretend to sell their goods cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market. They say more of their goods will be exported. The balance of trade will then more favour our own country. &quot;We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the foreign as we have done in the home market.</description>

                <description>37  The English colonies in North America have progressed the fastest.
 38  &ldquo;Plenty of good land, and liberty to manage their own affairs their own way, seem to be the two great causes of the prosperity of all new colonies.&rdquo;
 39  In the plenty of good land, the English colonies of North America are inferior to the colonies of Spain and Portugal.
The English colonies are not superior in land to some French colonies before the late war.</description>

                <description>47  Only enumerated commodities from the British colonies are confined to the market of Great Britain.
These commodities are called such because they were enumerated in the act of navigation and other subsequent acts. The rest are called non-enumerated. Non-enumerated commodities may be exported directly if= they are on British or Plantation ships, and their owners and 3/4 of the mariners are British.
 48  Some of the most important products of America and the West Indies are non-enumerated commodities:</description>

                <description>Unreasonableness of the Balance of Trade  1  The second expedient of the commercial system to increase the amount of gold and silver is to lay extraordinary restraints on imports from countries where the balance of trade is disadvantageous.
Thus in Great Britain, Silesia lawns may be imported for home consumption on paying certain duties. But French cambrics and lawns can only be imported in London where they are warehoused for re-exportation.</description>

                <description>41  Because of these maxims, the commerce between France and England has been subjected to so many discouragements and restraints.
If those two countries considered their real interest, without mercantile jealousy or national animosity, French commerce might be more advantageous to Great Britain than any other country. Great Britain&rsquo;s commerce will also be more advantageous to France. France is the nearest neighbour to Great Britain. The returns of the trade between the southern coast of England and the northern coasts of France might be expected at 4-6 times a year.</description>

                <description>17  The goldsmith&rsquo;s trade is very big in Great Britain.
Most of the new plate that they sell is made from old plate melted down. Thus, the addition made to the whole plate of the kingdom cannot be very great. It could require only a very small annual importation.
 18  It is the same case with the coin.
Nobody imagines that the annual gold coinage of more than £800,000 a year for 10 years, was an addition to the money in the kingdom.</description>

                <description>172  I have shown in Book 2 that every country&rsquo;s mercantile stock naturally seeks the employment most advantageous to its own country.
If the stock is employed in the carrying trade, its country becomes the emporium of the goods of all countries. But that stock&rsquo;s owner necessarily wishes to dispose as much of those goods as he can dispose at home.
He saves himself the trouble, risk, and cost of exportation.</description>

                <description>We can infer from Agobard’s letter to Lewis the Debonnaire that the custom of judicial combats was not established among the Franks.
After having represented to that prince the abuses of the law of Gundebald, he desires* that private disputes should be decided in Burgundy by the law of the Franks.
But the trial by combat at that time in France has been the cause of some perplexity. The law of the Salian Franks did not allow of this kind of trial but the Ripuarian Franks did.</description>

                <description>105  By the act of navigation, England assumed to herself the monopoly of the colony trade.
The foreign capitals employed in it were withdrawn from it. The English capital which did a part of it now did the whole. The capital which supplied the colonies with part of the European goods they wanted was now all employed to supply them with the whole. But English capital could not supply the colonies with all European goods.</description>

When the people multiplied beyond what that territory could maintain, some of them searched for new habitation in remote parts. The warlike neighbours who surrounded them made it difficult enlarge their territory at home.</description>

                <description>25  A bounty on production would more directly encourage the production of any commodity than an export bounty.
It would impose only one tax on the people which is paid as the bounty. It would lower the price of the commodity in the home market. Instead of imposing a second tax on the people, it might at least repay them for the first tax they paid. Production bounties have been very rarely granted.</description>

                <description>157  It has been proposed that the colonies should be taxed by requisition.
The British parliament would determine the sum each colony should pay. The provincial assembly would assess and levy it in the best way suited to the province. In this way, what concerned the whole empire would be determined by the assembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire.
The provincial affairs of each colony might still be regulated by its own assembly.</description>

It makes silver buy less wheat and other home-made commodities because the money price of wheat regulates the money price of all other home-made commodities.
 12  The money price of wheat regulates the money price of labour.
The money price of labour must always enable the labourer to buy sufficient wheat to maintain him and his family in the liberal, moderate, or scanty manner which the advancing, stationary, or declining state of society oblige his employers to maintain him.</description>

                <description>The principal cause for the disuse of the Salic and Roman laws, and the Capitularies was the great extent given to judiciary combats.
The Salic laws did not admit of this custom and so they became useless and fell into oblivion. The Roman laws also rejected this custom. Their whole attention was then taken up in establishing the law of judicial combats, and in forming a proper digest of the several cases that might happen on those occasions.</description>

                <description>The laws of the Barbarians are strange.
The law of the Frisians allows only half a sou in composition to a person that had been beaten with a stick. Yet for ever so small a wound it allows more.
By the Salic law, if a freeman gave three blows with a stick to another freeman, he paid three sous; if he drew blood, he was punished as if he had wounded him with steel, and he paid fifteen sous= thus the punishment was proportioned to the greatness of the wound.</description>

 the pleasure of enjoyment the happiness of loving and being beloved and the ambition of pleasing the ladies because they are the best judges of some of those things which constitute personal merit.  This general desire of pleasing produces gallantry. It is not love itself, but the delicate and perpetual dissembler of love. According to the different circumstances of every country and age, love inclines more to one of those three things.</description>

                <description>24  According to the liberal and generous system of the Physiocrats, a landed nation can raise its own artificers, manufacturers, and merchants best by granting the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants of all other nations.
This would raise the value of its own surplus produce. This continual increase gradually establishes a fund which raises up all the artificers, manufacturers, and merchants that it needs.</description>

They discouraged manufactures or foreign trade more than encouraging agriculture directly or intentionally.
In several ancient Greek states, foreign trade was banned. In several others, the employments of artificers and manufacturers were considered hurtful to the human body&rsquo;s strength and agility. It rendered the body incapable of habits which their military and gymnastic exercises tried to form.</description>

                <description>WHEN pledges of battle had been received upon a civil affair of small importance, the lord obliged the parties to withdraw them.
If a fact was notorious;* for instance, if a man had been assassinated in the open market-place, then there was neither a trial by witnesses, nor by combat; the judge gave his decision from the notoriety of the fact.
When the court of a lord had often determined after the same manner, and the usage was thus known,† the lord refused to grant the parties the privilege of duelling, to the end that the usages might not be altered by the different success of the combats.</description>

                <description>Judicial combats ended the affair forever. It was incompatible with a new judgment, and new prosecutions. This made appeals unknown in France. Appeals were established by the Roman and Canon laws to a superior court, in order to re-judge the proceedings of an inferior court.
Appeals were strange to a warlike nation entirely governed by honour. An appeal among the Franks was a challenge to fight with arms, a challenge decided by blood, and not by an invitation to a paper quarrel.</description>

                <description>THE appeal of default of justice was when the court of a particular lord deferred, evaded, or refused to do justice to the parties.
During the time of our princes of the second race, though the count had several offices under him, their person was subordinate, but not their jurisdiction. These officers in their court-days, assizes, or placita, gave judgment in the last resort as the count himself; all the difference consisted in the division of the jurisdiction.</description>

A vassal could not appeal the court of his lord of false judgment, without demanding a judicial combat against the judges who had pronounced sentence.
But St. Lewis introduced the practice of appealing of false judgment without fighting.</description>

                <description>Appeals were challenges to a combat. They must have been made immediately on the spot.
Beaumanoir says=
“If the party leaves the court without appealing he loses his appeal, and the judgment stands good.” This continued still in force, even after all the restrictions of judicial combat.  THE villain could not bring an appeal of false judgment against the court of his lord. This we learn from Défontaines, and is confirmed moreover by the institutions.</description>

                <description>DUELS had introduced a public form of proceeding. Beaumanoir says=
The witnesses should give their testimony in open court.  Boutillier’s commentator says that he had learned of ancient practitioners and from some old manuscript law books that criminal processes were anciently done in public similar to the public judgments of the Romans.
This was because they did not know how to write. Writing fixes the ideas, and preserves the secret.</description>

                <description>A PRINCE who undertakes to destroy or to change the established religion of his kingdom, must greatly expose himself. If his government is despotic, he runs a much greater risk of seeing a revolution arise from such a proceeding, than from any tyranny whatsoever, and a revolution is not an uncommon thing in such states. The reason of this is, because a state cannot change its religion, manners and customs, in an instant, and with the same rapidity as the prince publishes the ordinance which establishes a new religion.</description>

                <description>The Roman republic devalued their coin by adding alloys because of the unwise spending of their leaders. They even plated or covered cheap metals like copper with a thin plate of silver. This money is mentioned in the 77th book of Dio.
Didius Julian first began to debase it. The coin of Caracalla had an alloy of more than half. The coin of Alexander Severus had 2/3. The debasing increased until under Gallienus until the silver coin was merely copper silvered over.</description>

The establishment of commerce depended on that of the exchange, and the transactions were inconsistent with all its laws.

                <description>ON the other hand, religion may support a state, when the laws themselves are incapable of doing it.
Thus, when a kingdom is frequently agitated by civil wars, religion may do much, by obliging one part of the state to remain always quiet. Among the Greeks, the Eleans, as priests of Apollo, lived always in peace.
In Japan*, the city of Meaco enjoys a constant peace, as being a holy city= religion supports this regulation, and that empire which seems to be alone upon earth, and which neither has, nor will have, any dependence on foreigners, has always, in its own bosom, a trade which war cannot ruin.</description>

If we compare the mass of gold and silver in the whole world, with the quantity of merchandise in it, every merchandize may be compared to a portion of the entire mass of gold and silver. As the total of the one is to the total of the other, so part of the one will be to part of the other.</description>

                <description>THERE is both real and ideal money.
Civilized nations generally only use ideal money, because they have converted their real money into ideal.
Their real money was initially some metal of a certain weight and standard. But soon dishonesty or lack made them reduce that metal from money, but money retained the same name.
For example, they removed a half of the silver from a livre at a pound weight, but still called it a livre.</description>

                <description>SPECIE is the sign of value. He who has occasion for this sign, should pay for the use of it, as well as for everything else that he has occasion for.
All the difference is, that other things may be either hired or bought; whilst money, which is the price of things, can only be hired, and not bought.*
To lend money without interest, is certainly an action laudable and extremely good; but it is obvious, that it is only a counsel of religion, and not a civil law.</description>

                <description>IT appears from a passage of the books of the pontiffs, quoted by Cicero*, that they had amongst the Romans unpardonable crimes.
it is on this that Zozymus founds the narration so proper to blacken the motives of Constantine’s conversion; and Julian, that bitter raillery on this conversion in his Cæsars.
The Pagan religion prohibited only some of the grosser crimes, and which stopped the hand, but meddled not with the heart, might have crimes that were inexpiable=</description>

                <description>SOME have imagined that it was advantageous for a state to be indebted to itself.
They thought that this multiplied riches, by increasing the circulation. They confounded a circulating paper which represents money or profits with a paper which represents a debt.
Circulating money or profits are extremely advantageous to the state.
But a debt can never be advantageous. It only shows that the people trust their government as to lend to it.</description>

                <description>THE first men, says Porphyry, sacrificed only vegetables. In a worship so simple, every one might be priest in his own family.
The natural desire of pleasing the Deity multiplied ceremonies. From hence it followed, that men employed in agriculture became incapable of observing them all, and of filling up the number.
Particular places were consecrated to the gods; it then became necessary that they should have ministers to take care of them; in the same manner as every citizen took care of his house and domestic affairs.</description>

Chapter 2: Motives to Religion THE different religions do not give to those who profess them equal motives of attachment. This depends greatly on the manner in which they agree with the turn of thought and perceptions of mankind.

Plain good-sense and the practice of the world can serve most purposes of life, but are ineffective against them.Both history and daily experience has instances of capable men who are enslaved by the grossest superstition.

                <description>It is difficult to prove the Immortality of the Soul by reason alone. The arguments for it are derived from metaphysical, moral, or physical topics. But in reality, it is the gospel alone that has brought life and immortality to light.
 Metaphysical topics are founded on the supposition that the soul is immaterial, and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance.  But just metaphysics teach us:</description>

Religion is made to influence the heart. It should give many counsels and few precepts. It gives rules:
 not for what is good, but for what is better not to direct to what is right, but to what is perfect  Religious teachings should be counsels, and not laws, for perfection can have no relation to the universality of men or things.</description>

                <description>The Salic, Ripuarian, and other barbarous laws punished crimes with pecuniary fines. They did not have a public officer who does criminal prosecutions. And indeed the issue of all causes being reduced to the reparation of damages, every prosecution was in some measure civil, and might be managed by any one.
On the other hand, the Roman law had popular form for the prosecution of crimes, which were inconsistent with the office of a public prosecutor.</description>

The avaricious hoard up their gold and silver.
They do not care to spend. They are fond of signs that are not subject to decay. They prefer gold to silver, because as they are always afraid of losing, they can best conceal that which takes up the least room.</description>

                <description>GARCILASSO informs us, that in Spain after the conquest of the Indies, interest fell from 10% to 5%.
The cause is that conquest bringing in a lot of money suddenly into Europe. Many persons got money and had a need for it. The price of all things increased, while the value of money diminished. The proportion was then broken, and all the old debts were discharged.
We may recollect the time of the system when every thing was at a high price except specie.</description>

                <description>The judicial forms of the canon law were preferred to those of the Roman law because they constantly had before them the ecclesiastic courts which followed the forms of the canon law.
They knew of no court that followed those of the Roman law. Besides, the limits of the spiritual and temporal jurisdiction were then very little understood.
Some people sued and were tried indifferently in either court. It seems‡ as if the temporal jurisdiction reserved no other cases exclusively to itself than the judgment of feudal matters∥, and of such crimes committed by laymen as did not relate to religion.</description>

This moral kind of painting for the stage has been often compared to the painting for cupolas and cielings, where the colours are over-charged, and every part is drawn excessively large, and beyond nature. The figures seem monstrous and disproportioned, when seen too nigh;
but become natural and regular, when set at a distance, and placed in that point of view, in which they are intended to be surveyed.</description>

                <description>THE civil power was in the hands of an infinite number of lords. This made it easy for the ecclesiastic jurisdiction to gain daily a greater extent.
The ecclesiastic courts weakened the courts of the lords and strengthened the royal jurisdiction which then gradually checked the clergy&rsquo;s jurisdiction.
The parliament, which in its form of proceedings had adopted whatever was good and useful in the spiritual courts, soon perceived nothing else but the abuses which had crept into those tribunals.</description>

Schools were then established in Italy, where it was publicly taught. They had the Justinian code, and the Novellae. This code was so favourably received in Italy as to eclipse the law of the Lombards.
The Italian doctors brought the law of Justinian into France, where they had only the Theodosian code.</description>

Or, are they sensible, that the misfortunes and miscarriages of the married state are owing more to their sex than to ours?

The usage of judicial combats was then beginning to decline, so they made their inquests in writing.
But a verbal proof committed to writing, is never more than a verbal proof. It only increased the expences of law proceedings. Regulations were then made which rendered most of those inquests useless.</description>

Good or bad fortune is caused by the good or bad qualities of people. There are many instances to the contrary. But these are few, relative to the actual distribution of prosperity and adversity and to the common course of human affairs.
We will get love and esteem if we have benevolence and love. This is the chief circumstance in life. It facilitates every enterprize and undertaking besides the satisfaction, which immediately results from it.</description>

Every lordship had its civil law, according to Beaumanoir, and so particular a law, that this author who is looked upon as a luminary, and a very great luminary, of those times, says, he does not believe that throughout the whole kingdom there were two lordships intirely governed by the same law.
This prodigious diversity had a two-fold origin.</description>

                <description>Some men try to distinguish themselves by ridiculing everything that was sacred and venerable to mankind.
They rail against Reason, Sobriety, Honour, Friendship, Marriage perpetually. They even regard public spirit and nationalism as fake.
If the schemes of these anti-reformers were to be implemented, the bonds of society will break. and make way for licentious mirth and gaiety.
 Drunken frollics would be preferred to friendship. Dissolute prodigality would drain away every valuable thing.</description>

                <description>Convents and Orphanages as Population Control Modern convents are bad institutions. These are popish institutions which should be condemned as:
 nurseries of superstition, burdensome to the public, and oppressive to their poor prisoners  Do they reduce a state&rsquo;s population size?
Anciently, every great family was a kind of convent. If a convent&rsquo;s lands were given to a nobleman, he would spend its revenue on dogs, horses, footmen, and house-maids.</description>

                <description>Upon comparing the whole, it is impossible why the world should have been more populous in ancient than in modern times.
The equality of property among the ancients, liberty, and the small divisions of their states, were favourable to their population growth. But:
 their wars were more bloody and destructive, their governments more factious and unsettled, commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing, and the general police more loose and irregular.</description>

An exception is the Roman commonwealth wherein no blood was ever shed in any sedition at Rome, until the murder of the Gracchi.
Dionysius Halicarnassæus, observed the singular humanity of the Roman people and which makes him believe that they were originally of Greek extraction.</description>

                <description>Ancient Housing Halicarnassæus says that:
The ancient walls of Rome were nearly of the same compass with those of Athens, but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent. It was difficult to tell, where the town ended or the country began.  Halicarnassæus, Juvenal, and other ancient writers say that the Roman houses were high and families lived in separate storeys, one above another.
But these were probably only the poorer citizens in a few streets.</description>

The following prove the mortality of this world, its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state or order to another:
 the continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge, or general convulsion of the elements  Society must therefore have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age, similar to that each individual form which it contains.</description>

                <description>What is the population size of particular cities in antiquity, omitting Nineveh, Babylon, and the Egyptian Thebes?
The more I look into this, the more I doubt the great populousness of the ancient times.
Plato says:
Athens was the greatest of all the Greek cities, except Syracuse, which was nearly about the same size in Thucydides’s time, and afterwards encreased beyond it.  Cicero mentions Athens as the greatest of all the Greek cities in his time, excluding Antioch or Alexandria.</description>

                <description>Aethereal Relativity is made up of the principles that dictate aethereal movement. It is the most important of all the relativities since it controls or affects all the layers underneath.
It is divided into 2 planes:
 Physical - this dictates the movement of of physical objects between galaxies, multiverses, and timelines. This is Physical Aethereal Relativity Metaphysical - this layer dictates the movement of ideas. Aethereal Relativity defaults to this.</description>

 Shallow thinkers who fall short of the truth Abstruse thinkers, who go beyond it. This is the most rare and by far the most useful and valuable.  Abstruse thinkers suggest hints. Sometimes, they start difficulties if they lack the skill to pursue an idea. At worst, abstruse thinkers say uncommon things, which are hard to understand but at least are new.</description>

                <description>The previous post explained the concept of Qosts or the quantum of space time . These are points in spacetime that gather energy to create mass in order to create discrete things. These create spacetime by their mutual repulsion and, thus, are essential in levitation and teleportation.
  These can also be employed to harness energy in two ways:
  By tapping into the repulsion of qosts that lead to the accelerated expansion of space.</description>

                <description>Rent is a monopoly price  1  Rent is naturally the highest which the tenant can afford to pay.
The landlord tries to leave the tenant only:
 the wages needed to maintain his workers, and ordinary profits after maintaining his capital.  Ordinary profit is the smallest share which the tenant can have without being a loser. The landlord seldom means to leave him any more. The landlord naturally tries to gain as rent whatever is left over of the price after ordinary profits.</description>

                <description>I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist, L. Boltzmann.
We were taught that Euclid’s geometry is true. But are we really sure?
Geometry has concepts like “plane,” “point,” and “straight line.” These lead to axioms which we are inclined to accept as “true.”
From this, all the remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven.
A proposition is then correct(“true”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms.</description>

                <description>This is because aggressive and defensive strength is obtained only through group feeling which means (mutual) affection and willingness to fight and die for each other.
Royal authority is a noble and enjoyable position. It comprises all the good things of the world, the pleasures of the body, and the joys of the soul.
Therefore, there is, as a rule, great competition for it. It rarely is handed over (voluntarily), but it may be taken away.</description>

He cannot do without the social organization for which the philosophers use the technical term &ldquo;town&rdquo; (polis).
This is what civilization means.
The necessary character of human social organization or civilization is explained by the fact that God created and fashioned man in a form that can live and subsist only with the help of food.</description>

It manifests as the space, size, and age of the universe. It gives the ideas and energies from the aethereal layer a chance to cross over onto physical reality via gravitation through stars and galaxies.
The creation of gravitational nodes leads to the mutual repulsion between nodes, leading to the perception of space and time.</description>

                <description>The aethereal is the highest layer in the universe, and is underneath only the metaphysical layer, which itself is bounded by pre-existence.
This layer is best represented by the mind or soul. We can say that the universe is one huge mind, which the Hindus call Brahma. In our matrix analogy, this mind can be seen as the RAM of a computer that generates its own virtual reality.
Unlike Science and New Age philosophy that puts emphasis on consciousness as to put all existential mysteries in it, Superphysics puts all the mysteries in the aether which is the material or principles of the mind.</description>

Money becomes the measure of commodities because all commodities are products of human labour. Money therefore is the measure of labour time.The expression of the value of a commodity in gold — x commodity A = y money-commodity — is its money-form or price.

                <description>Most theories of value and production focus on the distribution of a given volume of employed resources between different uses. These uses determine their relative rewards and the relative values of their products.
Those theories describe the volume of the available resources relative to:
 the employable population size the extent of natural wealth the accumulated capital equipment  But the pure theory of what determines the actual employment of the available resources has seldom been examined in detail.</description>

                <description>Confucius To learn, and then to practise opportunely what one has learned, brings satisfaction.
To have associates in study coming to one from distant gives means pleasure.
The superior order of men are those who still remain pleased even if they do not comprehend this.
 Scholar-Yu True people who are dutiful to their parents and elder brothers rarely turn currishly on their superiors. Such a desire not to commit that offence prevents anarchy or disorder.</description>

                <description>People always want a number when calculating. Every number is composed of units. Any number can be divided into units.
Every number, which may be expressed from one to ten, surpasses the preceding by one unit. Afterwards, the ten is doubled or tripled, just as before the units were. Thus arise 20, 30, until 100. The 100 is doubled and tripled in the same way up to 1,000, and so on without limit.</description>

The ordinary means therefore to encrease our wealth is by Forraign Trade wherein we must ever observe this rule= to sell more than we buy of theirs in value.
If we sell our excess worth £2,200,000 pounds to foreign countriess and buy foreign goods worth £2,000,000 pounds, we will get richer by £200,000 in money because the part of our stock not returned to us in goods must necessarily return in money.</description>

 15  &ldquo;Employment is much more constant in some trades than in others.&rdquo;
In most manufactures, a journeyman can get a job almost everyday. But a mason or bricklayer, on the contrary, cannot work in bad weather.
 His employment depends on the calls of his customers. He frequently has no work. His earnings must:  maintain him while he is idle and compensate his anxiety and despondence.</description>

                <description>What is the actual statistical relationship between:
 changes in money-wages and changes in real wages?  In a particular industry, one would expect the change in real wages to be in the same direction as the change in money-wages.
But in the case of general wages, the change in real wages associated with a change in money-wages, is so far from being in the same direction. It is almost always in the opposite direction:</description>

                <description>10  Food is always in demand because men, like animals, naturally multiply in proportion to their subsistence.
Food can always command labour, especially the class of labour in the neighborhood that grew it. But it might not always command a higher class of labour which have much higher wages than the class that produced the food.
 11  Agricultural lands produce more food than is needed by the agricultural labour that produces it.</description>

                <description>5. Religious propaganda gives a dynasty at its beginning more power This is because religious coloring does away with mutual jealousy and envy among people who share in a group feeling, and causes concentration upon the truth.
When people (who have a religious coloring) come to have the (right) insight into their affairs, nothing can withstand them, because their outlook is one and their object one of common accord.
They are willing to die for (their objectives).</description>

 the farmer is generally just a farmer, and the manufacturer is just a manufacturer.  The labour needed to produce any manufacture is almost always divided among many hands.
So many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures:</description>

The difference between commodities and money does not sweep away these inconsistencies. Instead it develops a modus vivendi, a form in which they can exist side by side.
This is how real contradictions are reconciled.
Exchange is a process that transfers commodities from hands in which they are non-use-values, to hands in which they become use-values.</description>

 when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination.  These faculties may mimic the perceptions of the senses. But they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment.
The utmost we say of them, even when they operate with greatest vigour, is, that they represent their object in so lively a manner, that we could almost say we feel or see it.</description>

                <description>Luxury is an ambiguous word used both in a good and a bad sense. In general, it means great refinement in the gratification of the senses.
Any degree of it may be innocent or blameable, according to the age, country, or condition of the person. Its virtue and vice cannot here be exactly fixed, more than in other moral subjects.
Religious fervor sees that the gratification and indulgence in meat, drink, or apparel, is of itself a vice.</description>

They introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so observable that any particular thought, which breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately remarked and rejected.
Even in our wildest and most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other.</description>

                <description>The struggle over money-wages is often believed to determine the general level of real wages.
Workers have an imperfect mobility. Wages do not tend to an exact equality of net advantage in different occupations. Anyone accepts lower money-wages relative to others, will get lower real wages. This makes workers resist it.
On the other hand, it would be impracticable to resist every reduction of real wages, due to inflation. Workers do not resist this unless the inflation is extreme.</description>

                <description>8. The greatness, territorial size, and length of a dynasty depend on the numbers of its supporters. This is because royal authority exists only through group feeling.
Representatives of group feeling are the militiamen who settle in the territories of the dynasty. The more numerous the tribes and groups of a large dynasty, the stronger and larger are its and lands. Their royal authority, therefore, is wider.
An example of this was the Muslim dynasty when God united the power of the Arabs in Islam.</description>

The Carrying Trade We can earn more money by bringing in more foreign goods to be re-sold overseas, since we would not need them locally.
 If we send £100,000 money to Amsterdam to buy Pepper then send it to Italy, it must yield £200,000, doubling the money.</description>

                <description>The change of C—M—C causes the circulation of the material products of labour. It needs a given value in the shape of a commodity to begin and end the process.
The movement of the commodity is therefore a circuit.
On the other hand, the form of this movement precludes a circuit from being made by the money. The result is not the return of the money, but its continued removal further and further away from its starting-point.</description>

                <description>The first and the second of the cultivated zones have less civilization than the other zones.
The latter is interspersed with empty waste areas and sandy deserts and has the Indian Ocean to the east. The nations and populations of the first and second zones are few.
The third, fourth, and subsequent zones are just the opposite.
Waste areas there are few. Sandy deserts also are few or non-existent. The nations and populations are tremendous.</description>

                <description>The Quran is the word of God that was revealed to His Prophet.
It was written down between the two covers of copies of the Qur&rsquo;an (mushaf). Its transmission has been continuous in Islam.
However, the men around Muhammad transmitted it on his authority in different ways. Eventually, seven ways of reading the Qur&rsquo;an became established. Transmission (of the Qur&rsquo;an readings), with their particular pronunciation, also was continuous. They came to be ascribed to certain men from among a large number of persons who had become famous as their transmitters.</description>

 54  After food, clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind.
 55  In its rude state, land has a super-abundance of the raw materials for clothing and lodging, more than it can feed.
In its improved state, it can sometimes feed more people than it can supply with clothing and lodging.</description>

                <description>This is because scientific instruction is one of the crafts, and crafts are numerous only in cities.
The quality and the number of the crafts depend on the greater or lesser extent of civilization in the cities and on the sedentary culture and luxury they enjoy, because (highly developed crafts) are something additional to just making a living.
When civilized people have more labor available than they need for mere subsistence, such (surplus) labor is used for activities over and above making a living.</description>

                <description>Money takes the shape of coin because it is the circulating medium.
The weight of gold represented in imagination by the prices or money-names of commodities, must confront those commodities, within the circulation, in the shape of coins or pieces of gold of a given denomination.
Coining, like the establishment of a standard of prices, is the business of the State. The different national uniforms worn at home by gold and silver as coins, and doffed again in the market of the world, indicate the separation between the internal or national spheres of the circulation of commodities, and their universal sphere.</description>

That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides, is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures.

Interest Rates are Not Caused by Money Supply But this is not true since the only effect of the plenty of money is to raise the price of labour. Silver is more common than gold. You receive more of it for the same commodities. But do you pay less interest for it?</description>

                <description>10  The division of labour greatly increases productivity. This productivity in a well-governed society creates the universal opulence which extends to the poor.
Every worker produces a lot more goods than what he himself needs. This allows all workers to exchange their excess goods among each other, creating a general plenty that diffuses itself through the different ranks of society.
 11  The accommodation of a common day-labourer in a civilized country involves a small part of the industry of so many people.</description>

                <description>The Propensity to Trade, Arising from Reason and Speech, Creates the Division of Labour  1  This division of labour is not originally the effect of any human wisdom. It is the necessary, very slow, gradual, consequence of the propensity in human nature to exchange one thing for another.
 2  This propensity to trade probably arises from our faculty for reason and speech more than it being an original principle of human nature.</description>

                <description>10. By its very nature, the royal authority claims all glory for itself and goes in for luxury and prefers peace This is because the group feeling that leads to royal authority is a composite of the amalgamation of many groups, one of which is stronger than all the others.
Thus, a group feeling is able to overcome and gain power over all the others. Eventually, it brings them all under its sway.</description>

                <description>Based on resources and costs, the employment of a given volume of labour by an entrepreneur involves him in two kinds of expense:
  His payments for the factors of production (exclusive of other entrepreneurs) for their current services, which we shall call the factor cost of the employment in question

                <description>11. The dynasty becomes senile after it claims all glory for itself and establishes luxury and tranquility This can be explained in several ways.
 The royal authority, by its very nature, must claim all glory for itself.  As long as glory was the common (property) of the group, and all members of the group made an identical effort (to obtain glory), their aspirations to gain the upper hand over others and to defend their own possessions were expressed in exemplary unruliness and lack of restraint.</description>

The first zone runs along the equator, north of it. South of it, there is only the civilization to which reference was made by Ptolemy. Beyond that are waste regions and sandy deserts, up to the circle of water which is called the Surrounding Sea.</description>

                <description>Market Size is The Most Important Factor that Leads to the Division of Labour in Society  1  Since the power of exchanging creates the division of labour, the extent of the market must always limit that division. When the market is very small, no one can dedicate himself entirely to one employment because few people will buy his excess produce.

                <description>These stages are natural ones for dynasties. The superiority through which royal authority is achieved is the result of group feeling and of the great energy and rapacious habits which go with it. As a rule, these things are possible only in connection with desert life.
The first stage of dynasties, therefore, is that of desert life. When royal authority is obtained, it is accompanied by a life of ease and increased opportunities.</description>

                <description>This is because leadership exists only through superiority, and superiority only through group feeling. 61
Therefore, the leadership over people must come from a group feeling that is superior to each individual group feeling.
Each individual group feeling that becomes aware of the superiority of the leader&rsquo;s group feeling is ready to obey that leader.
A person who has become attached to people of a common descent usually does not share the group feeling arising from their common descent.</description>

At one time, money must be attracted in order to act as circulating coin.
At another, circulating coin must be repelled in order to act again as more or less stagnant money.</description>

                <description>74  The price of coals in Westmorland or Shropshire can have little effect on their price at Newcastle.
Their price in Lionnois has no effect at all on their price at Newcastle. The produce of distant coal mines can never compete with one another. But the produce of the most distant metallic mines frequently do. The price of metals at the most fertile mines must affect the price at every other mine.</description>

                <description>The passion for philosophy, like that for religion, aims at the correction of our manners and extirpation of our vices.
But because of imprudence, it can foster am inclination and push the mind more resolutely towards that side which already draws too much.
We aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic sage and try to confine our pleasures within our own minds. But we might in the end, render our philosophy like that of Epictetus and other Stoics.</description>

They do not consider that:
 this prohibition acts directly contrary to their intention. the more they export, the more will be raised at home, of which they themselves wil l always have the first offer  The ancient laws of Athens criminalized the exportation of figs.

Meanwhile, the entrepreneur (including both the producer and the investor) has to form the best expectations[1] as to what the consumers will pay when he is ready to supply them after the long time from investment to production.
Business decisions depend on these expectations as:</description>

                <description>There is no such thing as Chance, only our ignorance of the real cause of any event.
There is certainly a probability, which arises from a superiority of chances on any side; and according as this superiority encreases, and surpasses the opposite chances, the probability receives a proportionable encrease, and begets still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side, in which we discover the superiority.
If a dye were marked with one figure or number of spots on four sides, and with another figure or number of spots on the two remaining sides, it would be more probable, that the former would turn up than the latter; though, if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner, and only one side different, the probability would be much higher, and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure.</description>

 He supplies the rest with the produce of the labour of others. Everyone lives by exchanging and the society grows into a commercial society.   2  But when the division of labour first began, this power of exchanging was frequently very much clogged and embarrassed in its operations.</description>

There should be only one variation in the comparative values of the commodities for use and the commodities for ornament.
The value of non-food produce should constantly rise relative to food produce.
As art and industry advance, clothing, lodging, fossils, minerals, precious metals and stones gradually become more in demand.</description>

This makes them always clear and determinate. The smallest distinction between them is immediately perceptible. The same words express the same ideas, without ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken for a circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis.
The isosceles and scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong. If any term be defined in geometry, the mind readily, of itself, substitutes, on all occasions, the definition for the term defined.</description>

                <description>Part 2 It is very common for people to refute a philosophical hypothesis by saying that it will have dangerous consequences to religion and morality.
Opinions that lead to absurdities are certainly false. But opinions are not false because of their dangerous consequences.
Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be forborne; as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general, without pretending to draw any advantage from it.</description>

They based this opinion from:
 agricultural prices and the popular notion that silver value declines as its quantity increases because rising national wealth increases the quantity of silver in every country   111  They made three mistakes on the observations on wheat=</description>

                <description>19. A sign of the qualification for royal authority is his eager desire to acquire praiseworthy qualities, and vice versa. Royal authority is something natural to human beings, because of its social implications.
Man has the power of logical reasoning. This inclines him towards good qualities than to bad ones since evil is the result of the animal powers in him. Royal and political authority come to man qua man, because it is peculiar to man and is not found in animals.</description>

At distant times, equal amounts of wheat will enable its possessor to buy or command nearly the same amount of the labour of other people. Although equal amounts of wheat will not do it exactly.
The worker&rsquo;s subsistence &amp; enjoyments depend on the advancing, stagnant, or reversing state of society.</description>

As long as a nation retains its group feeling, the royal authority that disappears in one branch will necessarily pass to some other branch This is because the people obtain royal authority only after proving their forcefulness and finding other nations obedient to them.
Only a few are then singled out to become the actual rulers.
It could not be all of them, because there is not enough room for all to compete for leadership, and because the existence of jealousy cuts short the aspirations of many of those who aspire to high office.</description>

                <description>120  The most judicious writers inferred the high value of silver in ancient times not so much from the low price of wheat, but from other rude produce.
In those rude ages, wheat was a sort of manufacture. It was much dearer than unmanufactured commodities such as cattle, poultry, game, etc.
Unmanufactured commodities were much cheaper than wheat in those barbarous times.
 But this cheapness was not the effect of the high value of silver, but of the low value of those commodities.</description>

It considers him perfect, either because:
 its respect for him impresses it, or it erroneously assumes that its subservience was due to the victor&rsquo;s perfection and not to the nature of the defeat  If that erroneous assumption fixes itself in the soul, then it becomes a firm belief.</description>

                <description>The doctrine of miracles is not significant.
But Dr. Tillotson argues against the reality of miracles. His argument is the most concise, elegant, and strong against miracles.
The authority of Christian scriptures is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles.
 They were the eye-witnesses to the miracles of our Saviour.  Those miracles proved his divine mission.    The evidence for the truth of the Christian religion is therefore less than the truth from our senses.</description>

                <description>Part 2 The testimony of a miracle might be the entire proof of it. The falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy.
But there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence.
 In all history, no miracle has been attested to by a sufficient number of men of unquestioned good-sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion  Such people cannot be suspected of wanting to deceive others.</description>

                <description>9  The real value of the parts of price is measured by the amount of labour which each part can purchase or command.
Labour measures the value that resolves itself into labour, rent, and profit.
 10  The price of every commodity finally resolves itself into some or all of those three parts. In every improved society, all the three, more or less, become components of the price of most commodities.</description>

 136  From 1570 to 1640, the proportion of silver and wheat values were opposite.
 Silver sunk in its real value. Wheat rose in its nominal price.  Instead of 2 ounces of silver the quarter or 120 pence today, it was sold for 6 and 8 ounces of silver or 360-480 pence today.</description>

All the customary activities of the Arabs lead to travel and movement. This negates the stationariness which produces civilization.
For instance, the Arabs need stones as supports for their cooking pots. They tear down buildings to get those stones.</description>

                <description>In the rude state, price has one component= Wages  1  In the rude state of society, only the quantity of labour regulates the exchangeable value of commodities.
For example, in a nation of hunters, a beaver is twice as hard to kill than a deer.
 A beaver is naturally exchanged for, or is worth, two deer. The produce of two hours of labour should naturally be worth double the produce of one hour&rsquo;s labour.</description>

                <description>1 The Objective Factors The volume of employment is determined by intersection of the aggregate supply function with the aggregate demand function.
The aggregate supply function depends on the physical conditions of supply, involves few considerations which are not already familiar.
The form may be unfamiliar but the underlying factors are not new.
Chapter 20 will elaborate on the aggregate supply function and its inverse, &ldquo;the employment function&rdquo;.
But it is the part played mainly by the aggregate demand function which has been overlooked.</description>

The lender and borrower do not need to transport metal money from state to state. These Exchanges are made between man and man.
They are not contracted at the equal value of the money, according to their respective weights and fineness, because the money-sender respects the debt and the terms.</description>

Men of sense condemn these undistinguishing judgments. But at the same time, they say that each nation has:
 a peculiar set of manners, and some particular qualities are more frequently seen among one people than others.  The common people in Switzerland are probably more honest than those Ireland.</description>

Its average was not so much below the general average of the first 64 years of the century.
 The year 1740 was a year of extraordinary scarcity. The years 1730-1749 were opposite those of 1750-1769. 1730-1749 were below the century&rsquo;s average, despite the dear years. 1751-1770 were above the century&rsquo;s average, despite the cheap ones (for example= 1759).</description>

They say that sometimes when our sterling money is undervalued and delivered here for Amsterdam at 10% less than the equal value of the respective Standards, the said mere Exchanger may take here £1,000 and carry over only £900, enough to pay his Bill of Exchange.</description>

Yet most religious philosophers still dispute whether anyone can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these contradictions?
The knights-errant wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants.
They believed in them.
The skeptic is another enemy of religion.

Yet is this the grand scope of all their enquiries and disputes.
They try to find objections, both to our abstract reasonings, and to those which regard matter of fact and existence.
The chief objection against all abstract reasonings comes from the ideas of space and time. Ideas might be very clear in common life and to a careless view.</description>

Most of the European nations are still governed by the principles of morality.
But if, from a long abuse of power, or the fury of conquest, despotic sway should prevail, neither morals nor climate would be able to withstand its baleful influence = and then human nature would be exposed, for some time at least, even in t his beautiful part of the world, to the insults with which she has been abused in the other three.</description>

                <description>Keeping Up the Market Price Above the Natural Price through Secrets of Trade and Manufactures  20  The market price always gravitates towards the natural price.
But it may stay above the natural price for long periods due to=
 natural accidents, and man-made accidents, as in regulations   21  When the effective demand increases, sellers are careful to conceal this increase to prevent new rivals.
Those rivals would reduce the market price to its natural price or even below it.</description>

Chapter 16: Distinctive Properties of a Republic IT is natural for a republic to have only a small territory. Otherwise, it cannot long subsist.
In a large republic, there are wealthy men of less moderation. there are trusts too considerable to be placed in any single subject; he has interests of his own; he soon begins to think that he may be happy and gl orious by oppressing his fellow-citizens; and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country.</description>

                <description>This is because they are more rooted in desert life than any other nation. They have less need of the products and grain of the hills, because they are used to a tough and hard life.
Therefore, they can dispense with other people. It is difficult for them to subordinate themselves to each other because they are used to no control and because they are in a state of savagery.</description>

                <description>The Author Gerard Malynes writes of the admirable feats done by Bankers and Exchangers in using the power of the Exchange.
But he has disguised his own knowledge with sophistry to further some private ends by hurting the public good. He should be discovered and prevented.
The admirable feats to be done by Exchange=
 To invest their money wherever in the world there is a gain in exchange To get rich but never meddle with any Prince&rsquo;s commodities To buy any Prince&rsquo;s commodity using public funds instead of their private money To grow rich and live safely at sea.</description>

Reason 1: The European market has become more extensive.  164  Most of Europe has improved since the discovery of America. England, Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia, have all advanced in agriculture and manufactures.
Italy did not go backwards.
 The fall of Italy preceded the conquest of Peru and has recovered a little since.</description>

                <description>Our missionaries inform us that:
 the Imperial Chinese government is admirable it has a proper mixture of fear, honour, and virtue.  Consequently, I must have given an idle distinction, in establishing the principles of the three governments.
But I cannot conceive what this honour can be, among a people who act only through fear of being bastinaded.
Our merchants* do not give us such accounts of the virtue so much talked of by the missionaries.</description>

                <description>Book 3 The Propensity to Consume Chapter 8 established that employment can only increase pari passu with investment. The Multiplier in our theory of employment is a definite ratio between:
 income and investment total employment and primary employment (employment directly employed on investment).  This establishes a precise relationship, given the propensity to consume, between aggregate employment and income and the rate of investment.
This was originally from Mr. R.</description>

                <description>AS distant as heaven is from earth, so is the true spirit of equality from that of extreme equality. The former does not imply that every body should command, or that no one should be commanded, but that we obey or command our equals. It endeavours not to shake off the authority of a master, but that its masters should be none but its equals.
In the state of nature, all men are born equal.</description>

The cultivated region of that part of the earth which is not covered by water has its center toward the north, because of the excessive heat in the south and the excessive cold in the north. The north and the south represent opposite extremes of cold and heat.
It necessarily follows that there must be a gradual decrease from the extremes toward the center, which, thus, is moderate.</description>

                <description>Royal authority is the natural goal of group feeling. It results from group feeling, not by choice but through (inherent) necessity and the order of existence, as we have stated before.287 All religious laws and practices and everything that the masses are expected to do requires group feeling.
Only with the help of group feeling can a claim be successfully pressed, as we have stated before. 288
Group feeling is necessary to the Muslim community.</description>

                <description>169  The continual consumption of the precious metals is very sensible:
 in coin by wearing in plate both by wearing and cleaning  Such metals require a very great annual supply.
The consumption of those metals in manufactures is much more rapid and sensible though it may be less than this gradual consumption in coin and plate.
In Birmingham manufactures alone, the gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating is more than £50,000 sterling.</description>

                <description>When a man makes an investment, he buys the right to prospective returns.
I call this &ldquo;the prospective yield of the investment&rdquo;.
This prospective yield has a supply price which is the cost to create that investment.
This supply price is not the market price at which it is bought.
The relation between the prospective yield and its supply price gives us its marginal efficiency of capital.
 It is equal to that rate of discount which would make the present value of the series of annuities given by the returns expected from the capital-asset during its life just equal to its supply price.</description>

At Court, he would talk to the lower order of great officials.
 He spoke somewhat firmly and directly and spoke more affably with those of the higher order.</description>

 Some Kings have their Crown Lands, Church lands, Customs, Tolls and Imposts on all imports and exports, Loans, Donations and Subsidies. Other States omit the last three and focus on the former as sales taxes and fees on the marriage money of women, licence mony upon all Victualling houses and Inkeepers, head mony, Custom upon all Corn, Wine, Oyl, Salt and the like.</description>

                <description>Is Treasuring by the Prince necessary?
Some people depend so much on their rulers that they call it baseness for their Prince to keep Treasure. They prefer that their Prince rely on the produce of the land instead of money, as proven in Caesar, Alexander, and others who achieved victories by lavish gifts and liberal expences.
They say that King David&rsquo;s money passed on to Solomon was used mostly for pomp and vain delights, except the ones spent to build the Temple.</description>

                <description>195  The second kind is the rude produce which human industry can multiply in proportion to the demand.
It consists of useful plants and animals which are naturally plentiful. This makes them of little use in uncultivated countries. But they gain value as cultivation advances.
During a long period of improvement, their amount diminishes while their demand increases. Their real value gradually rises until it reaches maximum profitability.</description>

                <description>*Superphysics Note= Here, we dissect Keynes&rsquo; reasoning on why his system is totally different from Classical &ndash; because he enshrines the love for cash!
 Chapter 11 shows that there are forces causing the rate of investment to rise or fall so as to keep the rate of return on investments equal to the rate of interest.
Yet the rate of return on investments is, in itself, a different thing from the rate of interest.</description>

                <description>27  In Great Britain, wages are in excess of what is needed to bring up a family.
We do not need to calculate the lowest sum needed to raise a family because there are many plain symptoms that wages are not at their lowest rates.
  28  Summer wages are different from winter wages in Great Britain.  Summer wages are always highest. The maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter due to high fuel costs.</description>

                <description>How much of the Prince&rsquo;s treasure should be spent yearly?
If a Prince has £2,000,000 yearly revenue, and spend but £1, why should he not spend the other?
The affairs of Princes is far different from normal people. A King&rsquo;s revenue is very great, yet if the Kingdom&rsquo;s gain is small, this gain must ever give rule and proportion to that Treasure, which may conveniently be laid up yearly,
If he amasses more money than is gained by the over-balance of his foreign trade, he shall ruin his Subjects.</description>

In contrast, Modern Economics only began from the Marginal Revolution of the 1870&rsquo;s. This makes it a toy idea that crashed quickly after 50 years as the Great Crash and Depression. Nowadays, this toy idea manifests as gaming via game theory, the stock market, and cryptocurrencies, all coming from the mercantile game of buying low and selling high.</description>

                <description>Poultry  202  In every farm, the offals of the barn and stables will maintain poultry.
These are fed with what would otherwise be lost and are a mere save-all. The farmer can sell his poultry for very little because they did not cost him anything. Almost all that he gets is pure gain.
Poultry prices can be so low that it discourages him from feeding any more. But in countries ill-cultivated and thinly inhabited, the poultry raised without cost are often sufficient to supply the whole demand.</description>

The soul becomes spiritual through freeing itself from bodily matters and corporeal perceptions. This happens to the soul (in the form of) glimpse(s) through the agency of sleep, as we shall mention.</description>

                <description>1 Investment is the use of assets (circulating or fixed) to earn profits.
 Interest is the revenue from lending those circulating assets to someone else for them to earn a profit from. Interest rate is the rate of revenue in lending. Savings are the assets that are taken out of one&rsquo;s own circulation to be circulated by someone else.  According to the Classical Theory:
 Investment is the demand for investable resources Savings represents the supply for investable resources The rate of interest is the “price” of investable resources at which the two are equated A commodity&rsquo;s price is fixed where its demand is equal to the supply.</description>

Its real price naturally rises in the progress of improvement. But it depends on the different accidents which affect human effort.

                <description>11  In our North American and West Indian colonies, both wages and interest, and consequently profits, are higher than in England.
Both the legal and market interest rates in the colonies run from 6-8%. High wages and high profits, however, rarely go together, except in the peculiar circumstances of new colonies.
Compared to other countries, a new colony:
 is more under-stocked relative to its territorial size for some time, is more under-peopled relative to the size of this stock, has more land than they have stock to cultivate, uses its stock to cultivate the most fertile and best situated land with access to waterways.</description>

                <description>Marriage is an engagement entered into by mutual consent for the propagation of the species. It is susceptible of all the conditions, which consent establishes, provided they be not contrary to this end.
A man, in conjoining himself to a woman, is bound to her according to the terms of his engagement.
In begetting children, he is bound, by all the ties of nature and humanity, to provide for their subsistence and education.</description>

                <description>Interest is the Best Indicator of Profits  1  The rise and fall in profits depend on the increasing or declining movement of the society&rsquo;s wealth.
This is also the cause of the rise and fall in wages, although those causes affect profits and wages very differently.
 2  The increase of stock raises wages and lowers profit.
When the stocks of merchants are turned into the same trade, their mutual competition lowers their profit.</description>

                <description>Fine writing, according to Mr. ADDISON, consists of sentiments, which are natural, without being obvious. There cannot be a juster, and more concise definition of fine writing. *95
Sentiments, which are merely natural, affect not the mind with any pleasure, and seem not worthy of our attention. The pleasantries of a waterman, ° the observations of a peasant, the ribaldry of a porter or hackney coachman, all of these are natural, and disagreeable.</description>

                <description>Soothsaying Soothsayers are persons who:
 gaze into transparent bodies, such as mirrors, bowls, or water, and examine the hearts, livers, and bones of animals, as well as those who cast pebbles and (date) pits  The real soothsayer does not need to make much of an effort in order to lift the veil of sensual perception. They, however, expend much effort to concentrate all sensual perception in one particular sense, the noblest one, which is vision.</description>

                <description>Some philosophers are surprised that all mankind have the same faculties yet:
 differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations condemn what is fondly sought after by another  Some are even surprised that a man differs so widely from himself at different times. He rejects with disdain what, before, was the object of all his wishes.
I think that this feverish uncertainty and irresolution is unavoidable. A rational soul, created to contemplate the Supreme Being and His works, should ever have peace and satisfaction, while detained in the ignoble pursuits of sensual pleasure or popular applause.</description>

The men who hold it give testimony-with the judge&rsquo;s permission-for or against people&rsquo;s (claims). They serve as witnesses when testimony is to be taken, testify during a lawsuit, and fill in the registers which record the rights, possessions, and debts of people and other (legal) transactions. This is the significance of the position.
I say &ldquo;the judge&rsquo;s permission&rdquo; because people may have become confused, and (then) only the judge knows who is reliable and who not.</description>

                <description>Monarchies get their foundation from a superstitious reverence to priests and princes who have commonly abridged the liberty of reasoning on religion and politics, and consequently on metaphysics and morals.
Among the arts of conversation, mutual deference or civility is the most pleasing. This makes us:
 resign our own inclinations to those of our companion, and curb and conceal our presumption and arrogance  A good-natured educated man practises this civility to every mortal, without premeditation or interest.</description>

                <description>I am often skeptical of the decisions of philosophers that I tend to dispute them.
They all seem to make the mistake of confining their principles instead of accounting for the vast variety of nature.
When a philosopher has once laid hold of a favourite principle, which perhaps accounts for many natural effects, he extends the same principle over the whole creation, and reduces to it every phænomenon, though by the most violent and absurd reasoning.</description>

 our coin is undervalued in the foreign exchange in a country where our exports are less than the value of our imports from that country our coin is overvalued in the foreign exchange in a country where our exports are more than the value of our imports from that country  The foreign exchange for trade financing has a high, at par, or low rate.</description>

                <description>The revolutions and periods in human history are full of variety and surprize in the manners, customs, and opinions.
Civil history has more uniformity than the history of learning and science. The wars, negotiations, and politics of one age resemble more those of another, than the taste, wit, and speculative principles.
Interest and ambition, honour and shame, friendship and enmity, gratitude and revenge, are the prime movers in all public transactions.</description>

                <description>This was created in the period of the first four caliphs. This is because the men around Muhammad and all the other early Muslims called Abu Bakr, when he received the oath of allegiance, &ldquo;representative&rdquo; (khalifah, caliph) of the Messenger of God. This form (of address) was used until he died.
Then, the oath of allegiance was rendered to &lsquo;Umar who was appointed by (Abu Bakr), and people called &lsquo;Umar &ldquo;Representative of the Representative of the Messenger of God.</description>

In the Muslim dynasty, the Arabic language situation and the custom of expressing what one wanted to express in good form intensified the need for the office.
Thus, writing came to convey, as a rule, the essence of a matter in better stylistic form than was possible in oral expression.</description>

                <description>What are the motives for liquidity-preference?
It is also closely connected with the &ldquo;income-velocity of money&rdquo;.
The income-velocity of money merely measures what proportion of their incomes the public chooses to hold in cash, so that an increased income-velocity of money may be a symptom of a decreased liquidity-preference.
It is not the same thing since it is in respect of his stock of accumulated savings, rather than of his income, that the individual can exercise his choice between liquidity and illiquidity.</description>

                <description>The British government is a source of division and party. It has a just balance between the republican and monarchical part in its constitution. This balance is also extremely delicate and uncertain. It leads to many different opinions.
Those of mild tempers, who love peace and order, and detest sedition and civil wars, will always prefer monarchy.
The bold and generous men prefer liberty.
All reasonable men agree in general to preserve our mixed government; yet, when they come to particulars, some will incline to trust greater powers to the crown, to bestow on it more influence, and to guard against its encroachments with less caution, than others who are terrified at the most distant approaches of tyranny and despotic power.</description>

                <description>Political writers who are free from party-prejudices cultivate a science that contributes most to public utility, of all sciences. They get a private satisfaction from it. However, I suspect that the world is still too young to establish many general universal truths in politics.
We still have not experienced 3,000 years and so the art of reasoning is still imperfect in this science, as in all others. We even lack sufficient materials to reason on.</description>

                <description>It affords a violent prejudice against almost every science, that no prudent man, however sure of his principles, dares prophesy concerning any event, or foretel the remote consequences of things. A physician will not venture to pronounce concerning the condition of his patient a fortnight or month after: And still less dares a politician foretel the situation of public affairs a few years hence. HARRINGTON thought himself so sure of his general principle, that the balance of power depends on that of property, that he ventured to pronounce it impossible ever to re-establish monarchy in ENGLAND: But his book was scarcely published when the king was restored; and we see, that monarchy has ever since subsisted upon the same footing as before.</description>

The influence of useful inventions in the arts and sciences mgi perhaps, extend farther than that of wise laws, whose effects are limited both in time and place; but the benefit arising from the former, is not so sensible as that which results from the latter.</description>

                <description>It is wrong to say that all governments are alike, and that their only difference is in the character and conduct of the governors. If this were true, then most political disputes would end and there would be just one constitution for all. I condemn the idea that human affairs are merely caused by the casual humours and characters of particular men.
The goodness of all government is in the goodness of the administration.</description>

After the removal of its prophet, a religious group must have someone to take care of it. (Such a person) must cause the people to act according to the religious laws. In a way, he stands to them in the place (khalifah, caliph) of their prophet, in as much as (he urges) the obligations which (the prophet) had imposed upon them.</description>

                <description>AN act of individual saving is a decision not to have dinner today. But it does lead to a spending of that saving to buy dinner at a later date.
Thus, it depresses the food service business or other consumption businesses. It is a net reduction of such demand. The expectation of future consumption is based on present consumption. A reduction in present consumption will likely depress future consumption. This will result in the act of saving:</description>

                <description>Is the idea of the balance of power created by modern policy? Or is it a new invention?
Xenophon&rsquo;s Institution of Cyrus writes about the combination of the Asiatic powers from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the Medes and Persians. This proves that the balance of power was a prevailing notion in the ancient times.
This balance is in the anxiety of Greek politics. Thucydides writes that the league formed against Athens leading to the Peloponnesian war was caused by this principle.</description>

 the ease with which the many are governed by the few. the implicit submission of men to their rulers.  What causes this?
We see:
 that the subjects always have the force to overturn their leader is always on the that the public opinion is the only thing that supports their leaders  Thus, government is founded only on opinion.

                <description>It is very common for commercial states to:
 be suspicious of the progress of their neighbours consider all trading states as their rivals suppose that it is impossible for any of them to flourish, but at their expence.  I oppose such a narrow and malignant thinking and assert that:
 the encrease of riches and commerce in any one nation commonly promotes, not hurts, the riches and commerce of all its neighbours a state cannot expand its trade and industry far if all the surrounding states are ignorant, slothful, and barbaric.</description>

                <description>The interest rate of money sets a standard to which the marginal efficiency of a capital-asset must attain if it is to be newly produced. This makes it play a part in limiting the level of employment.
At first sight, this is most perplexing. It is natural to enquire wherein the peculiarity of money lies as distinct from other assets, whether it is only money which has a rate of interest, and what would happen in a non-monetary economy.</description>

Bookkeeping remained in the hands of clients, Jews, and Christians. For (official) documents, a special secretary was appointed, as a precaution against possible publication of the ruler&rsquo;s secrets, something that would be disastrous to his role as political leader.</description>

                <description>Both &ldquo;the sword&rdquo; and &ldquo;the pen&rdquo; are instruments for the ruler to use in his affairs. However, at the beginning of the dynasty, so long as its people are occupied in establishing power, the need for &ldquo;the sword&rdquo; is greater than that for &ldquo;the pen.&rdquo; In that situation, &ldquo;the pen&rdquo; is merely a servant and agent of the ruler&rsquo;s authority, whereas &ldquo;the sword&rdquo; contributes active assistance.
The same is the case at the end of the dynasty when its group feeling weakens, and its people decrease in number under the influence of senility.</description>

In particular, it is an outstanding characteristic of the economic system in which we live that, whilst it is subject to severe fluctuations in respect of output and employment, it is not violently unstable.</description>

                <description>The origin of war is the desire of certain human beings to take revenge on others. Each (party) is supported by the people sharing in its group feeling.
When they have sufficiently excited each other for the purpose and the two parties confront each other, one seeking revenge and the other trying to defend itself, there is war. It is something natural among human beings.
No nation and no race is free from it because revenge comes from jealousy, hostility, or zeal in behalf of God, or zeal in behalf of royal authority and the effort to found a kingdom.</description>

The Classical Theory assumed that:
 the economic system was self-adjusting on an assumed fluidity of money-wages rigidity is to be blamed on maladjustment  A reduction in money-wages can in certain circumstances stimulate output, as the classical theory supposes. But I analyze it differently.

  The real rates of wages for which workpeople stipulate
  The shape of the Real Demand Function for Labour
  His work determines the shape of the latter function.
The fact that workpeople in fact stipulate, not for a real rate of wages, but for a money-rate, is not ignored; but, in effect, it is assumed that the actual money-rate of wages divided by the price of wage-goods can be taken to measure the real rate demanded.</description>

                <description>In 1609, Galileo, then Professor of Mathematics at Padua, in the service of the Venetian Republic, heard from a correspondent at Paris of the invention of a telescope, and set to work to consider how such an instrument could be made. The result was his invention of the telescope known by his name, and identical in principle with the modern opera-glass.
In a maritime and warlike State, the advantages to be expected from such an invention were immediately recognised, and Galileo was rewarded with a confirmation of his Professorship for life, and a handsome stipend, in recognition of his invention and construction of the first telescope seen at Venice.</description>

THERE is certainly something very noble and large-minded in the intention of those who have endeavoured to protect from envy the noble achievements of distinguished men, and to rescue their names, worthy of immortality, from oblivion and decay. This desire has given us the lineaments of famous men, sculptured in marble, or fashioned in bronze, as a memorial of them to future ages; to the same feeling we owe the erection of statues, both ordinary and equestrian;</description>

This relates the employment N with the aggregate supply price of the corresponding output.
The employment function:
 only differs from the aggregate supply function in that it is, in effect, its inverse function and is defined in terms of hourly pay. aims to relate the amount of the effective demand, measured inhourly pay, directed to a given firm or industry or to industry as a whole with the amount of employment, the supply price of the output of which will compare to that amount of effective demand.</description>

But when they pass to the Theory of Money and Prices, value becomes governed by
 the quantity of money,  its income-velocity,   the velocity of circulation relative to the volume of transactions  hoarding, forced saving, inflation and deflation et hoc genus omne.    Little attempt is made to relate these vaguer phrases to our former notions of the elasticities of supply and demand.</description>

                <description>Section 5 True inflation happens when a further increase in effective demand produces no increase in output. Instead the demand raises the cost-unit proportional to the increase in effective demand.
Up to this point, the effect of monetary expansion is entirely a question of degree, and there is no previous point at which we can draw a definite line and declare that conditions of inflation have set in.
Every previous increase in the quantity of money is likely, in so far as it increases effective demand, to spend itself partly in increasing the cost-unit and partly in increasing output.</description>

It follows that our theory can explain the Trade Cycle.
The Trade Cycle is highly complex. Every element in our analysis will be required for its complete explanation.
We shall find that fluctuations in the propensity to consume, in the state of liquidity-preference, and in the marginal efficiency of capital have all played a part.</description>

In the post-war years, his devotees bombarded me with copies of his works. As is often the case with imperfectly analysed intuitions, their significance only became apparent after I had reached my own conclusions in my own way.
Meanwhile, like other academic economists, I treated his profoundly original strivings as being no better than those of a crank.</description>

                <description>229  Most of the writers who collected the money prices in ancient times, considered the low money price of wheat and other goods (the high value of gold and silver) as a proof of=
 the scarcity of those metals, and the poverty of the country then.  This notion is connected with the Commercial system It measures wealth as the abundance, and poverty as the scarcity of gold and silver.</description>

                <description>The previous post explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings, just as a novelist writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind.
The purpose of ideas is to create experience. However, experience can only exist if there is an experiencer. Thus, there are only two things in this &lsquo;matrix&rsquo; of Existence:
 the experiencer the experience of ideas and feelings  The Positive and Negative Forces Before existence began, the Absolute Creator had nothing to create those experiencer and experiences.</description>

                <description>The extreme liberty that we enjoy in Britain surprises foreigners the most.
We can say whatever we want to the public and openly censure every measure by the king or his ministers.
If the administration resolves to go to war, they either wilfully or ignorantly mistake the interests of the nation. This is because peace is currently infinitely preferable. If our ministers prefer peace, our political writers breathe nothing but war and devastation.</description>

                <description>THE outstanding faults of the economy are:
 its failure to provide for full employment its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes.  My theory will obviously affect employment. But it is also relevant to inequality in 2 respects.
Since the end of the 19th century, direct taxation has significantly removed very great disparities of wealth and income especially in Great Britain. This manifests as:
 income tax surtax death duties  Many people want this carried much further.</description>

The money which a dealer keeps unemployed for answering occasional demands is dead stock. It produces nothing to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into=
 active and productive stock, materials to work on, tools to work with, provisions to work for, and stock which produces something to himself and his country.</description>

They invented cash accounts &ndash; another method of issuing their promissory notes.
 They give credit (£2,000-3,000 for example) to anyone who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good landed estate to become surety for him.</description>

                <description>79  The Bank of England is the biggest bank of circulation in Europe.
It was incorporated by a charter under the Great Seal on July 27, 1694. It then lent to government £1.2 million in exchange for an annuity of £100,000 composed of=
 £96,000 interest or 8% [1.2m * 0.08], and £4,000 annually for management expenses.  The Glorious Revolution established a new government which had a very low credit because it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest.</description>

 20  2. The stock of food owned by the butcher, farmer, wheat-merchant, brewer, etc.

The circulating capital which consists in money, and which only circulates those three, must always be deducted. Three things are needed to mobilize industry=
 materials to work on, tools to work with, and wages or recompense for the work done.  Money is neither a material to work on, nor a tool to work with.</description>

 raise the real rent of land, and increase the landlord&rsquo;s real wealth.   256  The extension of improvement and cultivation raises it directly. The landlord&rsquo;s share of the produce increases with the increase of the produce.

                <description>In Book 1 of A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume laid out his principle of the self.
According to him, &lsquo;identity&rsquo; is a perception of something that is separate from another perception. For example, the identity of a car&rsquo;s tire is a separate identity from the car because our minds can perceive them as separately existing.
If our minds cannot separate them, then their identity is one. An example is the balloon of a hot air balloon which cannot be separated without destroying its vehicle&rsquo;s identity.</description>

                <description>Lemaître favours a “cosmological constant” in the equations of gravitation. I think that such a constant is not convincing in the present state of our knowledge because it makes my general relativity logically complicated.
The introduction of such a constant implies a considerable renunciation of the logical simplicity of theory, a renunciation which appeared to me unavoidable only so long as essentially static nature of space.

That&rsquo;s because electrons are really positively charged! Benjamin Franklin made a mistake when he called electrons as negative.

                <description>Finding your Purpose in Life Act on it! Excitement is caused by a resonance with your Higher Self.
Excitement is a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; that the activity you are contemplating is aligned with your Higher Self, and this alignment is what causes the excitement. This naturally leads you to what you are &ldquo;meant&rdquo; to be doing - what your Soul &ldquo;hopes&rdquo; your free-will chooses to do. This is your &ldquo;Purpose&rdquo;. So this is the simple yet effortlessly-effective way to find your life&rsquo;s &ldquo;Purpose&rdquo;.</description>

                <description>In the previous post, we fixed relativity* by adhering to the rules** which Socrates*** mentioned earlier:
 Photons must not be used to build the solution There must be no constant The solution and cause of movement must be inherent to the object, as opposed to being external The solution must be universal, that is, applicable to all five layers of the Greek or Asian model of Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether   *We fix Newton in this post   **This adherence of logic to timeless metaphysical truths is the key aspect of the dialectical method that makes it different from the scientific method which is based on evidence supplied by the limited physical senses.</description>

                <description>Another illustration of this kind of error is the baseless conclusion critical readers of historical works draw when they hear about the position of judges and about the leadership in war and the command of armies that judges (formerly) exercised.
Their misguided thinking leads them to aspire to similar positions. They think that the office of judge at the present time is as important as it was formerly. When they hear that the father of Ibn Abi &lsquo;Amir, who had complete control over Hisham, and that the father of Ibn &lsquo;Abbad, one of the rulers of Sevilla, were judges, 168 they assume that they were like present-day judges.</description>

It may be reduced to three kinds=
  The home-trade   This is the purchase of local produce in one part of a country to sell in another part of the same country. It includes the inland and the coasting trade.
 The foreign trade of consumption   This is the purchase of foreign goods for home-consumption.</description>

                <description>65  More than 25 years have passed since the paper money issued by the Scottish banks was more than fully equal to what the national circulation could easily absorb and employ.
Those banks gave more than all the assistance possible to Scottish traders and entrepreneurs.
The traders and entrepreneurs had overtraded a little.
 They brought themselves either a loss or a profit reduction  This always results from the smallest degree of overtrading.</description>

                <description>42  Those five circumstances create inequalities in wages and profits.
But they create equality when the advantages and disadvantages in employments are both taken into account. They balance out gains and losses.
 43  To create this balance or equality, three things are needed on top of the most perfect freedom=
Equality Through Length of Time in Operations    44  The employments must be well known and long established in the neighbourhood   45 Where all other circumstances are equal, wages are higher in new than in old trades.</description>

                <description>Groceries and Retail  39  In a small sea-port town, a little grocer will make 40-50% from a stock of £100.
A wholesale merchant in the same place will make 8-10% on a stock of £10,000. The trade of the grocer may be necessary for the conveniency of the inhabitants. The narrowness of the market may not admit a larger capital. Man, must not only live by his trade, but live by it suitably to the qualifications it requires.</description>

 These draw many more people into those trades than natural.  In all Christian countries, the education of most churchmen is paid this way. Very few of them are educated at their own expence.
Those who pay for their own long, tedious, and expensive education will not always get the suitable employment.</description>

                <description>Economic Policy that Restricts the Free Movement of Labor and Stock leads to Inequality  97  This creates a very inconvenient inequality in the different employments.
 98  The statute of apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labour from one employment to another, even in the same place. The exclusive privileges of corporations obstruct it from one place to another, even in the same employment.
 99  Often, one manufacture gives high wages while another gives only bare subsistence.</description>

 120  Doctor Burns says=
After over 400 years, the attempt to strictly limit everyone to equal wages should by now be ended to allow industry and ingenuity.   121  Particular acts of parliament, however, still attempt to regulate wages.
The 8th of George the 3rd prohibits all master tailors in London and five miles round it, from giving more than 31.</description>

                <description>7  The monied interest naturally increases with the increase in the circulating capital in a country.  The increase of those capitals for lending naturally accompanies the increase of the capitals.  In other words, as stock increases, the amount of stock to be lent at interest gradually grows.
 8  As the capitals for lending increase, its interest diminishes in the same way that the market prices of goods diminish when their quantity increases.</description>

The circulating notes of banks are the best known and best adapted as paper money.
 28  When people have such confidence in a banker, they believe that he is always ready to pay upon the presentation of his promissory notes.
Those notes become equal to gold and silver money from the confidence that money can be received for the notes at any time.</description>

This analog light data can then be absorbed by glass or semiconductor crystals to be processed by normal computer logic.
This principle was recently proven to be realizable in Germany . In their experiment, intense light pulses of waves ranging from near-infrared to visible orange were used to generate oscillating currents in a chip made with gallium arsenide.</description>

This was very difficult for the holders of such notes. It must have degraded this currency below the value of gold and silver money. An Act of Parliament declared all such clauses unlawful.

 There are some commodities which has a price made up of wages and profits only. There are very few in which it consists in wages only.  The price of every commodity resolves itself into some one, or other, or all of these three parts. If it goes neither to rent nor wages, then it goes to somebody&rsquo;s profit.</description>

                <description>Neutral Props In a theater that shows many plays, there may be some props back-stage that are frequently used for several different plays. For each play that prop has a special meaning, but outside that play, the prop has no innate intrinsic built-in meaning. All the props are basically without meaning.
From this innate absence of meaning, we can assign any meaning we want to them.
Likewise, all the events that you experiencing as &ldquo;happening&rdquo; in your life are &ldquo;neutral props&rdquo;.</description>

                <description>Buddhist Economics focuses on optimal consumption, Economics focuses on optimal production Buddhist economics tries to maximise human satisfactions by the optimal pattern of consumption.
Modern economics tries to maximise consumption through the optimal pattern of production.
A life which aims for the optimal consumption will need less effort than a life which aims for maximum consumption.
 Therefore, it is not surprising that the pressure and strain of living is very much less in Burma than in the US, despite the US having so much more labour-saving machinery.</description>

                <description>56  The policy of Europe prevents perfect liberty and creates other more important inequalities.
 57  Inequality is done in three ways=
 By restraining the competition to fewer than natural. By increasing the competition beyond the natural. By obstructing the free circulation of labour and stock from employment to employment and from place to place.  A. The Economic Policy that Reduces Competition leading to Inequality  58  The policy of Europe creates a very important inequality in the employments of labour and stock by reducing competition.</description>

                <description>The life of mortal animal necessarily consisted of fire and breath. This allowed it to waste away by dissolution and depletion.
The gods contrived a remedy for this by creating another kind of animal.
These are the trees and plants which have been improved by cultivation.
Anciently, they were wild. They are a third kind of soul, which is seated between the midriff [heart chakra] and the navel [chakra].
It has no reason or mind, but only in feelings of pleasure and pain and the desires which accompany them.</description>

                <description>Production vs Services  1  Productive labour adds value while unproductive labour does not. The labour of a manufacturer adds to=
 the value of the materials which he works on, the value of his own maintenance, and the value of his master&rsquo;s profit.  On the contrary, the labour of a menial servant adds to the value of nothing.
The manufacturing worker costs nothing to his employer even though the employer pays his wages.</description>

                <description>Reducing Competition through Exclusive Corporations  72  All corporations and most of corporation laws have been established to prevent this reduction of price by restraining that free competition which would most certainly occasion it.
This price reduction would lower wages and profit. Only the town corporate&rsquo;s authority was needed to establish a corporation in ancient times. In England, a charter from the king was necessary. But this prerogative of the crown was to extort money from the subject, than for defending against oppressive monopolies.</description>

                <description>We all know that physical reality exists inside space and time, and that space and time are the properties of the universe. But how were space and time and the universe created?
According to Physics, it was created through a &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; of a material Singularity. This led to matter and energy, just as we see sharpnel and light, and feel the energy from exploding fireworks. What is the nature of this Material Singularity?</description>

                <description>The Five Layers of Superphysics In a previous post , we explained that a universe begins as a &ldquo;Big Bootup&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wakeup&rdquo; when ideas flow from the metaphysical plane onto the physical plane. These ideas flow down onto the five layers or elements of the Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese in five phases:
   Phase Layer Physics Name Sequence     0 Metaphysical Pseudo-science The pre-existing ideas as potentialities are deployed onto reality   1 Aethereal Higgs The aether compiles the compound ideas as potential universes in the multiverse   2 Spatial Gravitation The compiled ideas are sent through qosts as galaxies and then as stars.</description>

                <description>Trust  20  Wages vary according to the trust reposed in the workers.
 21  The wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are superior to other workmen because they are entrusted with precious materials.
 22  We trust our health to the physician and we trust our fortune, life, and reputation to the lawyer.
Such confidence could not safely be entrusted to mean or low people.
 Their reward must give them that rank which so important a trust requires.</description>

                <description>Some people are extremely sensitive to all the accidents of life. It gives them joy on every prosperous event, as well as grief on misfortunes and adversity. Favours and good acts easily engage their friendship, while the smallest injury provokes their resentment. Any honour or mark of distinction elevates them above measure. But they are as sensibly touched with contempt.
Such people have more lively enjoyments, and more pungent sorrows than sedate men.</description>

                <description>Physics is based on a materialistic interpretation of reality, which is opposite of the metaphysical interpretation by Superphysics.
For example, physics prefers to view things as particles. This is consistent with the atomic model of Democritus and opposite of the musical model of Pythagoras.
 The atomic model was embraced by Newton and Einstein The musical model was embraced by Socrates and Kepler  We continue this musical paradigm by using waves instead of particles.</description>

                <description>1  The stock lent at interest is always considered as a capital by its lender.
He expects that:
 it will be restored to him in due time the borrower will pay him a rent for using it  The borrower may use it as a capital or as a stock for immediate consumption. If he uses it as a capital, he employs it to maintain productive labourers.</description>

                <description>73  In the midst of this clamour and distress, a new bank was established in Scotland to relieve the country&rsquo;s distress.
The design was generous but the execution was imprudent. It did not understand the nature and causes of the distress it meant to relieve.
Compared to any other bank, it was more liberal in:
 in granting cash accounts and in discounting bills of exchange  It discounted all bills equally, including real and circulating bills.</description>

                <description>30  The capital employed in the carrying trade is diverted from supporting its productive labour to support that of foreign countries. It may replace the capitals of foreign countries.
The Dutch merchant who sends the Polish wheat to Portugal and returns Portuguese fruits &amp; wines to Poland, replaces the capitals of Poland and Portugal.
 Neither of those two capitals supported the productive labour of Holland. One of the capitals supports the productive labour of Poland The other one supports that of Portugal.</description>

 the cost of house-rent wages of servants, clerks, accountants, etc.  It also spends to keep a large amount at all times in its coffers for answering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes.
 This amount pays no interest. The expence of replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied when answering those occasional demands.   50  Let us say that:</description>

                <description>14  Wages and profits would be very low in a country:
 which had acquired maximum riches natural to its soil, climate, and location, and which could not advance further but was not going backwards.  A country at maximum population would have so much competition for employment. Wages would be reduced to bare sufficiency, preventing the population from increasing.
A country fully stocked in all the trades possible would have great competition everywhere.</description>

But the amount of that labour varies extremely according to=
 the diversity of their employment and the value it adds to the national annual produce.   2  A capital may be employed in four ways=
 In procuring the rude produce required for society&rsquo;s use and consumption   Examples are the capitals used in improving or cultivating lands, mines, or fisheries  In manufacturing and preparing that rude produce for immediate use and consumption   Examples are the capitals of all master manufacturers  In transporting the rude or manufactured produce from where they abound to where they are wanted   Examples are the capitals of all wholesale merchants  In dividing portions of rude or manufactured produce into small parcels for those who want them.</description>

                <description>13  The proportion between industry and idleness is regulated by the proportion between capital and revenue.
 Wherever capital predominates, industry prevails. Wherever revenue, idleness.  Therefore, every increase or reduction of capital naturally increases or reduce the real amount of industry.
Capital affects the number of productive hands. The number of productive hands affects the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabitants.
 14  Capitals are increased by parsimony and decreased by prodigality and misconduct.</description>

                <description>78  John Law thought that Scotland&rsquo;s industry languished for the lack of money to employ it. He proposed to remedy this lack by establishing a bank which would issue paper based on the whole value of all the lands in the country.
The Parliament of Scotland rejected his proposal. The Duke of Orleans (Regent of France) adopted it with some variations.
The idea of multiplying paper to almost any extent was the real foundation of the Mississippi scheme.</description>

 It is sometimes violent and very difficult to restrain, leading to wastefulness. Generally, it is only momentary and occasional.  The desire of bettering our condition is the principle which prompts to save.
 It is a desire which is generally calm and dispassionate. It comes with us from birth and stays with us until we die.</description>

                <description>The Stock for Consumption  12  The first is the part reserved for immediate consumption.
It affords no revenue or profit. It is made up of the stock of food, clothes, furniture, etc. which have been bought but not yet entirely consumed.
Houses The whole stock of houses makes a part of this first division.
The stock laid out in a house ceases from being a capital or from affording any revenue.</description>

                <description>Nature has endowed man with a sublime celestial spirit and an affinity with superior beings. She allows not such noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle.
She urges him, by necessity, to employ, on every emergence his utmost art and industry.
Animals have many of their necessities supplied by nature. They are clothed and armed by Nature.
Their own industry is requisite on any occasion, nature, by implanting instincts, still supplies them with the art, and guides them to their good, by her unerring precepts.</description>

                <description>Fixed Capital, Circulating Capital, and Stock for Consumption  1  When a man&rsquo;s stock can only maintain him for a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it.
 He consumes it as sparingly as he can. He tries to acquire new supplies before it is consumed.  In this case, his revenue is derived from his labour only. This is the state of most of the labouring poor in all countries.</description>

                <description>88  The circulation of every country is divided into two branches:
 The circulation of the dealers with one another, and The circulation between the dealers and the consumers.  Each circulation requires a certain stock of money.
Paper or metal money may be employed in either circulation.
The value of the goods circulated between the dealers and dealers can never exceed the value of those circulated between dealers and consumers.</description>

                <description>In Superphysics, physical existence is made when the aether arbitrarily creates quanta of spacetime or qost *, which are 1-dimensional points, within itself. Each point is a discrete and unique identity filled with an arbitrary amount of qualities as potentiality.
 *pronounced as &lsquo;kost&rsquo;. This is supposed to be the graviton which will never be found, because it can only be felt since it lies in the spatial layer which is above the visible eletromagnetic layer.</description>

 plain food coarse clothing corn and cattle wool and raw hides  When no commerce or manufactures is available to allow him to exchange his surplus, he can only use it to feed and clothe as many people as possible.</description>

                <description>A quasi-contract is founded on the duty of restitution.
If you find a watch, you should give it back by the right of property, because a man does not lose property with possession. But if you and I balance accounts, and you pay me but you afterwards find that you did not owe that sum, how will you claim it?
You cannot ask for it because you alienated that sum. You cannot claim it by contract, for there never was one made between us.</description>

                <description>There is only ONE MOMENT in all creation - the eternal NOW.
&ldquo;Time&rdquo; is an illusion created by consciousness.
In a film projector, the individual frames of the film are shown in a rapid steady sequence - one frame at a time. This rapid steady sequence of STILL frames creates the ILLUSION of flowing time.
But in truth, all the actual frames that are used all exist simultaneously. There is the illusion of &ldquo;time&rdquo; only when the film projector displays those frames - one frame at a time - in a rapid steady sequence.</description>

                <description>A soul manifests in the physical dimension through a physical body which can be thought of as its vehicle. To maintain itself, the soul develops two things:
 an ego which is needed to drive action in physical existence a sense called a conscience to regulate that ego to keep it within its dharma . This sense leads to personal morals or personal do&rsquo;s and dont&rsquo;s while the soul is in the duality of physical existence  Souls can then bind themselves into a new entity called a society which gets its own soul from the individual souls that make it up.</description>

                <description>In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith gave tips on wealth-generation:
1. Build capital, not expense Capital is anything that produces value. It can be a physical thing like a machine that produces a valuable product or a metaphysical thing like skill, knowledge, relationships, trust, and integrity. Expense is spending that does not return any value. An example is consumption.
Capitals are increased by parsimony and decreased by prodigality and misconduct.</description>

                <description>Both Economics and Mercantilism use money as their store of value and tool of trade. Mercantilism was also called the Commercial system and now takes the form of E-commerce.
To buy anything online, you need a credit card or any electronic system to transfer cash payments. Prior to commercialization, the universal method was barter. For example, the Mongols and the Inca were able to sustain their empires by bartering goods and services.</description>

It&rsquo;s surprising that no one has pointed out to him that his rockets emit pollution and CO2. It would take so many polluting rocket launches to move heavy industries to the moon.</description>

                <description>Stagnation was a common phenomenon for large and developed countries. It usually happened when everyone achieved their natural state of wealth and is called a &lsquo;stationary&rsquo; state by Adam Smith:
In a country fully peopled.. the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce wages to the minimum needed to keep up the number of labourers. The population would not increase since the country is already populous.</description>

                <description>In Book 2, Chapter 5 of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith explained the four industries for goods, as the four employments of capitals:
1. Extractive This includes agricultural, mining, and fishing.
2. Processing This includes manufacturing
3. Wholesale This includes warehousing and logistics. Ecommerce allows consumers to buy good directly from the warehouse or supplier.
4. Retail This includes packaging and buying at the point of sale
According to Adam Smith, extractive and processing are the better foundations of wealth than foreign trade.</description>

Without a doubt, it was the spirit of monopoly which originally invented and propagated this doctrine. Those who first taught it were by no means such fools as those who believed it. In every country, it is always the people’s interest to buy whatever they want the cheapest.</description>

  Producer’s Surplus — defined as “the difference between how much of a good the producer is willing to supply versus how much he receives,” or the gain the producer receives  Consumer’s Surplus —defined as a situation when “the price that consumers pay for a product or service is less than the price they’re willing to pay,” or a bargain  Deadweight loss — defined as “a cost to society created by market inefficiency”.</description>

What are bonds? A bond is a loan to government, giving them private capital to spend for public uses. However, unlike a normal loan which is paid back in full and can be ended, a bond is a perpetual debt.
The investor enters this perpetual lending scheme by buying the bond and then exits at maturity by selling his bond back to the market.</description>

It can be applied to any problem in economics in order to provide common sense answers.</description>

                <description>A lot of people confuse socialism, left wing, democracy, and communism with each other. This is because ideas from one generation are commonly usurped by later generations according to their different experiences, rather than creating new names for new ideas arising from those new experiences.
A modern day example is the mobile phone and smartphone. A mobile phone means mobile telephone. When computer-abilities were added to it, it became a ‘smartphone’.</description>

                <description>The Origin of Laws According to David Hume, a society is bound together by laws from a justice system. These laws were originally created to make people useful to each other and to maintain peace and order.
Initially, these were dictated arbitrarily by a chieftain or king. In time, as the society progressed, those laws were decided by the people themselves through a parliament or senate. This allowed the laws to suit the people and their changing situation.</description>

                <description>The Enlightenment was said to be a period where reason dominated. So it follows that before and after that period, people were unreasonable or less reasonable.
The word &ldquo;reason&rdquo; comes fron Latin ratus which is to reckon, think, or judge.
This is similar yet different from the word &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; which comes from intelligo or to understand.
The problem is that these definitions only account for logic or the connection of ideas, and not the feeling that powers those connections.</description>

                <description>The Original Dialectics, Based on the Nature of Things The Dialectics of Socrates, or David Hume&rsquo;s science of man, is a system of analysis based on the invisible metaphysical True Nature or Dharma or Tao* of anything that exists in reality.
Its goal is to solve real, visible problems in order to keep up with that invisible nature, dharma, or tao. Or rather, problems crop up when one goes against that dharma or tao.</description>

                <description>According to Socrates, inequality takes root most commonly when a society transitions from intellectual rule to an oligarchy:
An Oligarchic State is not one, but two States, the one of poor, the other of rich men. They are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another. Their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes. Under such a constitution, the same persons have too many callings. They are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.</description>

                <description>The previous post explained that quantitative easing failed because of 2 mistakes of the banking system. Those mistakes are caused by the profit maximization doctrine of Neoclassical economics.
Here, we explain that such a doctrine also explains why interest rates are currently important, when they were not so important in Classical Economics. This is proven in the reasoning of John Maynard Keynes, one of the pillars of modern economics:
 Life is determined by resources Resources are determined by work and employment Employment is determined by investment  Investment is determined by the interest rate    Interest rate is determined by liquidity preference   Liquidity preference is determined by transactional motive and speculative motive These motives are determined by expectation Government policy on interest and public spending can affect this expectation and make people spend money in order to make an economy rise from the crash  To support this logic, he created the marginal efficiency of capital curve which is the ratio between an investment&rsquo;s cost and its future revenue.</description>

                <description>Pantrynomics uses the 4 Laws of Value to explain the dynamics of the flow of value in society. This is quantified through the DCTI tool which has 4 aspects:
 Demand (Law 1) Capital (Law 2) Trade (Law 3) Industry (Law 4)  Here, we explain the 5 modes of how the value takes shape as it flows as, or between, or among DCTI.
These modes match the 5 layers of reality:</description>

                <description>Useful work or effort is one of the foundations of Pantrynomics and is based entirely on Adam Smith’s Effort Theory of Value . This is totally different from Economics and Mercantilism which uses money as the basis through marginal pricing theory.
Since effort is very important, its definition becomes very important. In our theory, we have defined human effort, whether physical or mental, as ultimately rooted in psychological or metaphysical toil and trouble.</description>

                <description>Aside from the division of labor, Adam Smith is famous for his concept of the impartial spectator. This spectator is the thing that guides us to do the right thing and avoid doing wrong. Many people would equate it to conscience, even if Smith mentioned that it is not so:
These must be left to the decision of the man within the breast, the supposed impartial spectator, the great judge and arbiter of our conduct.</description>

                <description>In his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, David Ricardo criticizes Adam Smith&rsquo;s wheat-based valuation and replaces it with his own theory which is based on money-wages.
By looking at his work, we can see that he never understood the metaphysics behind Smith&rsquo;s labor theory of value in the first place. We go through his reasoning below.
Adam Smith said that the value of all things was relative to the amount of labour bestowed on their production.</description>

  Lack of cultivation by the big land owners
  Payment of the rent in kind
  The farmer has less produce to pay as rent after a bad harvest, but he will have a bit more money to pay because the scarcity will increase the money price of his little harvest.
 Additional taxes by the government (kings)</description>

                <description>Are you looking for a career that gives a high salary or deciding what kind of business to establish? Adam Smith enumerated five factors that affect wages and profits:
 The agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments  A job&rsquo;s difficulty, cleanliness, and/or honorableness can lead to different wage and profit levels
The difficulty and cost of learning them  A job that requires a high degree of techincal skill will lead to higher wages than one that is simple.</description>

Unnatural climate change is caused by excessive greenhouse gases, best represented by carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activity. Though a lot of CO2 emissions come from energy and transportation, food production also contributes greatly to it.</description>

                <description>In Book 3, Chap 2, Adam Smith writes that people should own land only as they can productively use:
A great proprietor is seldom a great improver. In the disorderly times which created those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor was employed in defending his own territories and extending his jurisdiction over his neighbours. He did not have time to cultivate and improve the land. When law and order was established and afforded him this leisure, he often did not have the inclination nor the needed abilities.</description>

                <description>While reviewing my simplification of David Hume’s Treatise of Human Nature Book 3, I came upon a strange wiki article called Hume’s Is-Ought Problem
 Hume calls for caution against such inferences in the absence of any explanation of how the ought-statements follow from the is-statements. But how exactly can an “ought” be derived from an “is”? The question, prompted by Hume’s small paragraph, has become one of the central questions of ethical theory, and Hume is usually assigned the position that such a derivation is impossible.</description>

                <description>An important feature of Smith&rsquo;s Political Economy (and the science of Pantrynomics which we created from it) is the classification ofall revenue into either rent, wages, and profit.
Such classification is not so important to Economics which focuses on the quantity or dollar value of revenue instead of its quality. This classification is difficult nowadays when other kinds of revenue have been introduced, such as interest income, different kinds of taxes, royalties, revenue from membership fees, etc.</description>

This stagflation will increase from 2020 onwards up to 2030 when it will reach its peak, culminating in some kind of conflict. A stagflation is a phenomenon which has low employment and output while having high prices at the same time.

                <description>The previous post pointed out that Smith was one of the few Western intellectuals to hint at the concept of dharma, or the natural and sustainable activities of humans, and apply it both for moral and economic purporses.
Instead of the word dharma, however, he named his concept the invisible hand. This had economic applications in The Wealth of Nations and moral applications in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.
Weaponizing the Invisible Hand The main difference between Smith&rsquo;s invisible hand and Eastern dharma is that the former has moral, spiritual, and practical uses, while the latter emphasizes only its moral and spiritual use.</description>

For example, grief for private misfortunes and injuries may easily be too high in many people. They may also be too low, but rarely.
 We call excessive grief as &lsquo;weakness&rsquo; and &lsquo;fury&rsquo;. We call the shortage of grief as &lsquo;stupidity&rsquo;, &lsquo;insensibility&rsquo;, and &rsquo;lack of spirit&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>Summary: The effort theory of value is the foundation of Pantrynomics. It is derived entirely from Adam Smith&rsquo;s wheat-based valuation in the Wealth of Nations Book 1 Chapter 5. Instead of pegging value to metal coins, it pegs it to the abstract difficulty, stress, or hardship of a task to produce a product or service. This is then relativistically pegged to food through a points-ledger which the Physiocrats referred to as &ldquo;The Economic Table&rdquo;</description>

                <description>Romantic love is natural but is not commonly expressed because it might be odious or ridiculous 15 The habitual feelings from the imagination are perfectly natural. But they are little sympathized with because other people might not have the same habits to be able to sympathize with them. Thus, such passions are always somewhat ridiculous.
An example is strong romantic attachment. We are unable to imagine what lovers experience, so we are not as eager as they are.</description>

 On the contrary, when the observer finds that the observee&rsquo;s feelings do not match his, they appear improper to him.  Therefore, approving another&rsquo;s feelings is the same thing as entirely sympathizing with them.</description>

Our sympathy with them is divided between=
 its subject, or the person who feels them, and its object, or the person whom he is angry at.  The interests of these two are directly opposite.
 Our sympathy with the subject-person would prompt us to wish for fear.  Our sympathy with him is less than the anger which he feels=  because all sympathetic passions are inferior to the original ones, and beause of our opposite sympathy with the object-person.</description>

20
  Breaches of the rules of justice   These rules are all express and positive. Their violation is naturally attended with=
 the consciousness of deserving punishment and the dread of suffering punishment from God and man.  21
 Breaches of the rules of chastity   In all grosser instances, these are real breaches of the rules of justice.</description>

                <description>Introduction For a long time the science of politicswas confounded with political economy. But wealth is essentially independent of political organization.
Under every form of government, a state, whose affairs are well administered, may prosper. Nations have risen to opulence under absolute monarchs, and have been ruined by popular councils. If political liberty is more favourable to he development of wealth, it is indirectly, in the same manner that it is more favourable to general education.</description>

                <description>What Branches of Production Yield the most Liberal Recompense to Productive Agency.
The aggregate value of a product, in the way just described, refunds to its different concurring producers the amount of their advances, with the addition in most cases, of a profit, that constitutes their revenue. But the profits of productive agency are not of equal amount in all its branches; some yielding but a very scanty revenue for the land, capital, or indus- try, embarked in them; while others give an exorbitant return.</description>

He demonstrated that:
 wealth was the exchangeable value of things its extent was proportional to the number of things in our possession having value wealth could be created and engrafted on things previously destitute of value just as value could be given or added to matter wealth could be preserved, accumulated, or destroyed.</description>

A bankruptcy would probably obviate the necessity of fresh loans; but would not release an atom of the former taxation, where the interest of the debt is habitually paid, not with the proceeds of taxation, but with new loans. Thus, the burthens of the people would not be alleviated, 114 nor the charges of production reduced= consequently there would be no sensible reduction in the price of commodities; nor would British products find a readier market either at home or abroad.</description>

If we take the pains to inquire what that is, which mankind in a social state of existence denominate wealth, we shall find the term employed to designate an indefinite quantity of objects bearing inherent value, as of land, of metal, of coin, of grain, of stuffs, of commodities of every description.
When they further extend its signification to landed securities, bills, notes of hand, and the like, it is evidently because they contain obligations to deliver things possessed of inherent value.</description>

To avoid fatiguing the reader with abstract speculation, I shall begin with giving examples, which I shall take from every day’s experience and observation.

They may also be withdrawn both from unproductive consumption and from reproductive employment, and remain buried or concealed.
The owner of values, in so disposing of them, not only deprives himself of the self-gratification he might have derived from their consumption, but also of the advantage he might draw from the productive agency of the value hoarded.</description>

                <description>take the example of a product of external commerce; such as indigo.
The science of the geographer, the traveller, the astronomer, brings us acquainted with the spot where it is to be met with, and the means of crossing the seas to get at it. The merchant equips his vessels, and sends them in quest of the commodity; and the mariner and land-carrier perform the mechanical part of this production. If we examine closely the workings of human industry, it will be found, that, to whatever object it be applied, it consists of three distinct operations.</description>

                <description>It is in this light that all machinery must be regarded, from the simplest to the most complicated instrument, from a common file to the most expensive and complex apparatus. Tools are but simple machines, and machines but complicated tools, whereby we enlarge the limited powers of our hands and fingers; and both are, in many respects, mere means of obtaining the co-operation of natural agents. 72 Their obvious effect is to make less labour requisite for the raising the same quan- tity of produce, or, what comes exactly to the same thing, to obtain a larger produce from the same quantity of human labour.</description>

                <description>The close pursuit of this inquiry through all the arts of industry would show, that the advantage of machinery is not limited to the bare substitution of it for human labour, but that, in fact, it gives a positive new product, inasmuch as it gives a degree of perfection before unknown. The flatting-mill and the die execute products, that the utmost skill and attention of the human hand could never accomplish.</description>

                <description>In Book 2, we shall see how the actual demand for a product originating in its utility, is limited by the amount of the cost of production, and upon what principle its relative value is determined in each particular place. At present it is sufficient for the clear conception of commercial production, to con- sider the value of a product as a given quantity or datum. Thus, without examining the reason why oil of olives is worth at Marseilles thirty, and at Paris forty sous per lb.</description>

                <description>Industry and capital are likewise competent to produce by themselves, when that industry is employed upon products of foreign growth, procurable by capital only; as in the Euro- pean manufacture of cotton and many other articles. So that every class of manufacture is competent to raise products, provided there be industry and capital exerted. The presence of land is not absolutely necessary, unless perhaps the area whereon the work is done, and which is commonly rented, may be thought to come under this description, as in extreme strictness it certainly must.</description>

                <description>Colonies are settlements formed in distant countries by an elder nation, called the mother-country. When the latter wishes to enlarge its intercourse with a country, already populous and civilized, whose territory it has, therefore, no hopes of getting into its own possession, it commonly contents itself with the establishment of a factory or mercantile residence, where its factors may trade, in conformity with the local regulations, as the Europeans have done in China and Japan.</description>

                <description>1 Virtue is the temper of mind in the excellent and praise-worthy character. The nature of virtue may be reduced to three classes=
 The proper direction of all our feelings. These feelings may be virtuous or vicious according to=   their objects and how much they pursue them.  Virtue therefore consists in propriety.

Virtue is in the judicious pursuit of our own private interest and happiness through our selfish feelings.</description>

 By occupation, or the taking possession of what formerly belonged to nobody. By accession, when a man has a right to one thing in consequence of another, as of a horse’s shoes along with the horse. By prescription, which is a right to a thing belonging to another arising from long and uninterrupted possession.</description>

                <description>A portion of the demand for the precious metals is occasioned by their gradual destruction by use; for, although less subject to decay than most products, they are still perishable in a certain degree; and doubtless the wear, though slow, must be considerable upon the immense quantity of gold and silver in constant use, as well in the character of money, as in the various objects of spoons, forks, goblets, dishes, and jewellery of all sorts.</description>

                <description>Great inequality of private fortune is hostile to those kinds of consumption, that must be regarded as most judicious. In proportion as that inequality is more marked, the artificial wants of the population are more numerous, the real ones more scantily supplied, and the rapid consumption more common and destructive. The patrician spendthrifts and imperial gluttons of ancient Rome thought they never could squander enough. Besides, immoral kinds of consumption are infinitely more general, where the extremes of wealth and poverty are found blended together.</description>

But if they are courageous, they must learn other lessons, like those that will remove the fear of death. A man can be fearless of death if he does not believe that the world below is real and terrible.</description>

                <description>In treating of the elevation and depression of the price of commodities, although value has been expressed in money, no notice has been taken of the value of money itself; which, to say the truth, plays no part in real, or even in relative variation of the price of other commodities.
One product is always ultimately bought with another, even when paid for in the first instance in money.
When the price of wool is doubled, it is purchased with twice the quantity of every other commodity, whether the exchange be made directly, or through the intermediate agency of money.</description>

Besides the wants of individuals and of families which it is the object of private consumption to satisfy, the collection of many individuals into a community gives rise to a new class of wants, the wants of the society in its aggregate capacity, the satisfaction of which is the object of public consumption.
The public buys and consumes the personal service of the minister, that directs its affairs, the soldier, that protects it from external violence, the civil or criminal judge, that protects the rights and interests of each member against the aggression of the rest.</description>

The monstrous breach of faith on the part of the French government in 1721, in regard to its paper-money and the Mississippi share-holders, did not prevent the ready negotiation of a loan of 200,000,000 liv.</description>

                <description>When revenue is added to capital, it thenceforth ceases to be revenue, or, as such, to be capable of satisfying the wants of the proprietor. It can only yield an increased revenue, being an item of productive capital, consumable in the manner of capital, that is to say, in such way as to yield a product in exchange and return for the value consumed.
The price of an article is the quantity of money it may be worth; current price, the quantity it may be sure of obtaining at the particular place.</description>

                <description>Introduction 1 After the inquiry on the nature of virtue, the next important question in Moral Philosophy is about the principle of approbation.
The principle of approbation is the power of the mind which renders certain characters agreeable or disagreeable to us. It makes us=
 prefer one tenour of conduct to another, denominate the one right and the other wrong, consider the one kind of conduct as the object of approbation, honour, and reward, and consider the other kind of conduct as the object of blame, censure, and punishment.</description>

A 1% tax on the redemption of ground-rents and rent-charges was virtually a penalty upon an act, equally advantageous to the parties and to the community at large; a fine upon the meritorious exertions of prudent land-owners to pay off their incumbrances.
Taxation is a requisition by the government upon its subjects for a portion of their products, or of their value.</description>

                <description>Section 3: Taxation in Kind Taxation in kind is the specific and immediate appropriation of a portion of the gross product to the public service. It has this advantage, of calling on the producer only for what he has actually in hand, in the identical shape which it happens to be under. Belgium, after its conquest by France, found itself at times unable to pay its taxes, in spite of abundant crops; the war, and the prohibition of exportation, obstructed the sale of its produce, which the government enforced by demanding payment in money; whereas, the taxes might have been collected without difficulty, had the government been content to take payment in kind.</description>

                <description>A portion of the objects of public consumption have, in some very rare instances, been provided by a private individual. We see occasional acts of private munificence, in the erection of a hospital, the laying out of a road, or of public gar- dens upon the land, and at the cost, of an individual. In ancient times, examples of this kind were more frequent, though much less meritorious. The private opulence of the ancients was commonly the fruit of domestic, or provincial, plunder and peculation, or perhaps the spoil of a hostile nation.</description>

                <description>Jobbing in merchandise necessarily causes a loss, either to the jobber, if the price be not raised by the transaction, or to the consumer, if it be raised. 142
It is common to hear people descant upon the benefits of an active circulation; that is to say, of numerous and rapid sales. It is material to appreciate them correctly.
The activity of circulation is at the utmost pitch to which it can be carried with advantage, when the product passes into the hands of a new productive agent the instant it is fit to receive a new modification, and is ultimately handed over to the consumer, the instant it has received the last finish.</description>

A landed estate cannot be consumed; but its annual productive agency may; for when once that agency has been exerted, it cannot be exerted again. The improvements of an estate may be consumed, although their value may possibly exceed that of the estate itself; for these improvements are the effect of human exertion and industry; but the land itself is inconsumable.</description>

                <description>Production is the creation of utility, not matter. It is not to be estimated by the length, the bulk, or the weight of the product, but by the utility it presents.
Some items of human consumption are the spontaneous gifts of nature, and require no exertion of man for their production; as air, water, and light, under certain circumstances.
These are destitute of exchangeable value; because the want of them is never felt, others being equally provided with them as ourselves.</description>

He surpassed the rest of the Cephallenians in wisdom and renown.
This Ancæus, therefore, was ordered by the Pythian oracle to form a colony from Arcadia and Thessaly; and that besides this, taking with him some of the inhabitants of Athens, Epidaurus, and Chalcis, and placing himself at their head, he should render an island habitable, which from the virtue of the soil and land should be called Melamphyllos;[8] and that he should call the city Samos, on account of 3 Same in Cephallenia.</description>

The trader, manufacturer, and cultivator, purchase the raw material 8 and productive agency, which they consume in the preparation of new products. The immediate effect is precisely the same as that of unproductive consumption, namely, to create a demand for the objects of their consumption, which operates upon their price, and upon their production; and to cause a destruction of value But the ultimate effect is different; there is no satisfaction of a human want, and no resulting gratification, except that accruing to the adventurer from the possession of the fresh product the value which replaces that of the products consumed, and commonly affords him a profit into the bargain.</description>

Whatever be the denomination it bears, whether tax, contribution, duty, excise, custom, aid, subsidy, 66 grant, or free gift, it is virtually a burthen imposed upon individuals, either in a separate or corporate character, by the ruling power for the time being, for the purpose of supplying the consumption it may think proper to make at their expense; in short, an impost, in the literal sense.</description>

 Such as conduce to the satisfaction of positive wants  by which term I mean those, upon the satisfaction of which depends the existence, the health, and the contentment of the generality of mankind; being the very reverse of such as are generated by re fined sensuality, pride, and caprice. Thus, the national consumption will, on the whole, be judicious, if it absorb the articles rather of convenience than of display the more linen and the less lace; the more plain and wholesome dishes, and the fewer dainties; the more warm clothing, and the less embroidery, the better.</description>

A house&rsquo;s convenience gives regular pleasure to the spectator. He is as much hurt when he sees its inconvenience, such as=
 windows of different shapes, or the door in a wrong place.  The fitness of any system or machine for its intended purpose gives a beauty on the whole. It renders its very thought agreeable.

                <description>In every part of Europe, personal freedom became more generally respected due to the influence of public sentiment.
 calling all loans with interest as usury making idleness a quality of nobility  They perceived the decline of such prejudices to be favourable to the advancement of science, or to a more exact knowledge of the immutable laws of nature. This then has been favourable to the progress of industry, and industry to national opulence.</description>

Political economy, in the same manner as the exact sciences, is composed of a few fundamental principles, and of a great number of corollaries or conclusions, drawn from these principles.</description>

                <description>A monarchical or despotic government does not need virtue. The force of laws and the prince’s arm are enough to maintain it.
But in a popular state, virtue is necessary for its leaders. A monarch can fix his mistakes by himself. But if a democratic leader suspends the laws of a corrupted state, then that state is certainly undone.
The English couldn&rsquo;t establish democracy in the last century because their leaders did not have virtue.</description>

                <description>Relative to the constitution, political liberty arises from a distribution of the three powers.
Relative to the citizen, political liberty is in security.
 The constitution might be free, but the subject not. The citizen might be free, but not the constitution.  When the constitution is free by right and not in fact, the citizen will be free in fact, and not by right.
It is the disposition only of the laws, and even of the fundamental laws, that constitutes liberty in relation to t he constitution.</description>

                <description>Trade and barter adapt the products to the general nature of the demand.
The objects most in demand are food and habitation. The wants of each family or individual, are more or less fully satisfied, in proportion to the ability to purchase these objects. which ability depends upon the productive means and exertion of each respectively; in plain terms, upon the revenue of each respectively.
Thus, in the end, if we sift this matter to the bottom, we shall find, that families, and nations, which are but aggregations of families, subsist wholly on their own products; and that the amount of product in each case necessarily limits the numbers of those who can subsist upon it.</description>

                <description>Cheapness or plenty is the most proper way of procuring wealth and abundance.
Cheapness is the same thing with plenty. Water is so cheap because it is so plentiful. Diamonds are so dear because of their scarcity (Their real use seems not yet discovered).
To ascertain the most proper method of obtaining these conveniences, we should=
 consider what are the natural wants of mankind which are to be supplied, show wherein opulence consists.</description>

General Remarks In a society ever so little advanced in civilization, no single individual produces all that is necessary to satisfy his own wants; and it is rarely that an individual, by his single exertion, creates even any single product; but even if he does, his wants are not limited to that single article; they are numerous and various, and he must, therefore, procure all other objects of his personal consumption, by exchanging the overplus of the single product he himself creates beyond his own wants, for such other products as he stands in need of.</description>

                <description>Stewart was the leading advocate of the mercantile system. Its maxim is= the wealth of one set of men is derived from the impoverishment of another.
He is wrong in asserting, that, “when once a stop is put to external commerce, the stock of internal wealth cannot be aug- mented.” 54 Wealth, it seems, can come only from abroad; but abroad, where does it come from? from abroad also. So that in tracing it from abroad to abroad, we must necessarily, in the end, exhaust every source, till at last we are compelled to look for it beyond the limits of our own planet, which is absurd.</description>

Land has the faculty of transforming and adapting to the use of mankind an infinity of substances, which, without its inter- vention, would be to them of no service; it yields nutriment and vegetative juices to the grain, the fruits, and vegetables, whereon we subsist; as well as to the forests, whereof we construct our houses, ships, and furniture, and whence we derive fuel to keep us warm.</description>

                <description>THE public revenues are a portion that each subject gives of his property, in order to secure or enjoy the remainder.
To fix these revenues properly, the necessities of the state and those of the subject should be considered.
Imaginary wants are those which flow from the passions and the weakness of the governors. This arises from:
 the vain conceit of some extraordinary project, the inordinate desire of glory, a certain impotence of mind incapable of withstanding the impulse of fancy.</description>

 The Deity has his laws. The material world has its laws. Animals have their laws. Humans have their laws, created by their intelligence.  Some people assert absurdly that the various effects in this world were spontaneously produced by a blind fatality.
But this blind fatality cannot create intelligent beings.</description>

                <description>The capital used in productiion establishes a demand for capital to be so employed. It enables its owners to charge for that service.
&ldquo;The profit of capital&rdquo; earned by capitalist is distinct from the profit of the industry employing it.
 If he employs his capital himself, it becomes the revenue of his capital, which is added to that of his personal talent and industry, and often confounded with it. If he lends it, the revenue of capital is the interest paid for its use, the proprietor abandoning to the borrower the profit derivable from his personal employment of the capital lent.</description>

Industry, capital, and land, all yield, ceteris paribus, the largest profits, when the general demand for products is most active, affluence most expanded, profits most widely diffused, and production most vigorous and prolific.</description>

                <description>Book 1 showed that products are raised by the productive means at the command of mankind, that is to say, by human industry, capital, and natural powers and agents.
The products thus raised, form the revenue of those possessed of these means of production, and enable them to procure such of the necessaries and comforts of existence, as are not furnished gratuitously either by nature, or by their fellow-creatures.
Such as are capable of consumption, as, for instance, the float-ing values, whereon production expends its energies, may be consumed either in such manner as to occasion a re-production, in which case they will still constitute a part of the means of production; or in such manner as to yield no further production, in which case they cease to form any part of those means, and are devoted to pure destruction, more or less rapid.</description>

                <description>Those qualities, which are the ground of preference, and which give occasion to pleasure and pain, are the cause of many insignificant demands, which we by no means stand in need of.
The industry of human life is not employed in procuring food, clothes and lodging. It is employed in procuring those conveniences according to the nicety and delicacy of our taste. To improve and multiply the materials, which are the principal objects of our necessities, creates all the variety of the arts.</description>

                <description>IT is unnatural for a confederate government to have one state conquer another, as what happened in Switzerland in our days.
But this is not so absurd in mixed confederate republics, where small republics are associated with small monarchies.
It is also unnatural for a democratic republic to conquer towns which cannot enter into the sphere of its democracy.
It is necessary that the conquered people s hould be capable of enjoying the privileges of sovereignty, as was settled in the very beginning among the Romans.</description>

                <description>6 According to the ancient rhetoricians=
 a certain measure of verse was appropriated by nature to each species of writing each measure was naturally expressive of the writing&rsquo;s character or feeling. one verse was fit for grave, and another for gay works.  These could not be interchanged without the greatest impropriety. However, modern writing contradicts this principle even though modern writing appears extremely proper. The burlesque verse in English is the heroic verse in French.</description>

                <description>Socrates I think that Periander, Perdiccas, Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or some other rich, proud, and mighty man, was the first to say that justice is &ldquo;doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies.&rdquo; But if this definition of justice also breaks down, what other can be offered?  Several times, Thrasymachus tried to get the argument into his own hands. He had been put down by the rest of the company.</description>

That by which it is changed is the immediate mover; that which is changed, the matter; that into which it is changed, the form.

                <description>Pythagoras was thus benefited by and learned from Thales. For this, he entirely abstained from wine, animal food, and voracity. He confined himself to such essential nutrition which was easy to digest.
Because of this:
 his sleep was short his soul vigilant and pure, and his body stayed in a state of perfect and invariable health  These enabled him to sail to Sidon, being persuaded that this was his natural country.</description>

                <description>The right of accession is not so much founded in its utility as in the impropriety of not joining it to that object on which it has a dependence.
The milk of a cow I have purchased may not be of great value, but it is very improper that another person should have a right to bring up his calf upon it.
The most important accessions are in land property. Land property is founded on division or an assignation by the society to a particular person of a right to sow and plant a certain piece of ground.</description>

                <description>1737-1740 Smith entered Glasgow College in October 1737 and remained there until spring 1740. Back then, the arts curriculum spanned over five sessions. Thus, Smith did not complete the course required for a degree.
He attended three sessions, going through the classes of Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and Moral Philosophy. These classes drew students from afar and had remarkable intellectual activity.
Dr. A. Carlyle came to Glasgow College formoved his divinity classes after he had finished his arts course at Edinburgh.</description>

                <description>THE state of villainage is sometimes established after a conquest. In that case the bondman or villain that tills the land should have a kind of partnership with his master. Nothing but a communication of loss or profit can reconcile those who are doomed to labour to such as are blessed with a state of affluence.
Chapter 4= A Republic in the like Case WHEN a republic has reduced a nation to the drudgery of cultivating her lands, she should never suffer the free subject to have a power of increasing the tribute of the bondman.</description>

 criminal laws derive each punishment from the nature of the crime. there are then no arbitrary decisions the punishment does not flow from the capriciousness of the legislator, but from the very nature of the thing man uses no violence to man  There are four sorts of crimes:
 Religious crimes Moral crimes Crimes against the public peace Crimes against the citizen&rsquo;s security  The punishments inflicted for these crimes should come from the nature of each of these species.</description>

                <description>Antecdent to the above-mentioned laws are those of nature.
 They get their force entirely from our frame and existence. To know these laws, we must see man before the establishment of society.  The laws received in such a state would be those of nature. The most natural law is to love the Creator, though it is not the first in sequence.
Man, in a state of nature, would have the faculty of knowing before he had acquired any knowledge.</description>

When we see one man assisted, protected, relieved by another, our sympathy with the beneficiary&rsquo;s joy animates our fellow-feeling with his gratitude to his benefactor. We therefore readily sympathize with his gratitude and applaud the returns he makes to his benefactor.</description>

                <description>The universal propositions of mathematics do not deal with objects which exist separately, apart from extended magnitudes and from numbers.
but with magnitudes and numbers, not however qua such as to have magnitude or to be divisible, clearly it is possible that there should also be both propositions and demonstrations about sensible magnitudes, not however qua sensible but qua possessed of certain definite qualities.
For as there are many propositions about things merely considered as in motion, apart from what each such thing is and from their accidents, and as it is not therefore necessary that there should be either a mobile separate from sensibles, or a distinct mobile entity in the sensibles, so too in the case of mobiles there will be propositions and sciences, which treat them however not qua mobile but only qua bodies, or again only qua planes, or only qua lines, or qua divisibles, or qua indivisibles having position, or only qua indivisibles.</description>

The true devotee of philosophy is always pursuing death. He has had the desire of death all his life long.  Simmias laughingly: Our people will think that philosophers want to die, and will think them deserving death.

                <description>Chapter 5= Virtue is not the Principle of a monarchical Government Monarchies, policy effects great things with as little virtue as possible.
Thus, in the nicest machines, art has reduced the number of movements, springs, and wheels.state subsists independently of the love of our country, of the thirst of true glory, of self-denial, of the sacrifice of our dearest interests, and of all those heroic virtues which we admire in the ancients, and to us are known only by story.</description>

                <description>Must we suppose something apart from individual things, or is it these that the science we are seeking treats of?
But these are infinite in number. Yet the things that are apart from the individuals are genera or species; but the science we now seek treats of neither of these. The reason why this is impossible has been stated.
It is in general hard to say whether one must assume that there is a separable substance besides the sensible substances (i.</description>

                <description>The substance and nature of the One exists in two ways.
What is the One? How must we conceive of It?
Should we take the One itself as being a substance, as both the Pythagoreans say in earlier and Plato in later times?
Or is there an underlying nature that indicates that the One should be described more intelligibly as a physical substance which is similar to love, or to air, or to the indefinite?</description>

                <description>Should the sciences inquire into the truths which are in mathematics called axioms, and into substance?
This also involves philosophy or the science of the philosopher; for these truths hold good for everything that is, and not for some special genus apart from others. And all men use them, because they are true of being qua being and each genus has being.
But men use them just so far as to satisfy their purposes; that is, as far as the genus to which their demonstrations refer extends.</description>

                <description>Smith left Scotland for Oxford in June 1740, riding the whole way on horseback. He told Samuel Rogers many years afterwards that, from the moment he crossed the Border he was much struck with=
 the richness of the country he was entering, and the great superiority of its agriculture over that of his own country.  Scotch agriculture was not born in 1740, even in the Lothians. The country everywhere was very bare and waste.</description>

                <description>IF a monarchy can survive before it is weakened by its increase, it will become formidable. Its strength will remain entire while pent up by the neighbouring monarchies.
Thus, a monarchy should not conquer beyond the natural limits of its government. In this kind of conquest things must be left as they were found; the same courts of judicature, the same laws, the same customs, the same privileges= there ought to be no other alteration th an that of the army and of the name of the sovereign.</description>

                <description>Contrariety is the greatest difference between things.
Things which differ in genus have no way to one another, but are too far distant and are not comparable; and for things that differ in species the extremes from which generation takes place are the contraries, and the distance between extremes-and therefore that between the contraries-is the greatest.
&ldquo;But surely that which is greatest in each class is complete. For that is greatest which cannot be exceeded, and that is complete beyond which nothing can be found.</description>

 characters to their citizens, and sentiments about the praiseworthiness of those characters, according what is usual.  The politeness highly esteemed in Russia would be seen as rudeness and barbarism at the French court.
 A Polish nobleman might see a certain frugality as excessive parsimony, but it might be regarded as extravagance in Amsterdam.  Every age and country looks on that quality commonly seen in those who are esteemed among themselves, as the golden mean of that talent or virtue.</description>

It is not required of those who are brought up to live in civilized societies.

                <description>Early societies had democratic governments. How were republican governments introduced?
Generally, a country&rsquo;s location and its improvement in agriculture and trade make it favourable to the introduction of a republican government.
There is little probability that republican governments will ever be introduced into Mongolia or Arabia, because their country cannot be improved.
 Most part of its lands are hills and deserts and is only fit for pasture They are generally dry and do not have any big rivers.</description>

                <description>IN order to make the purchaser confound the price of the commodity with the tax, there must be some proportion between the tax and the value of the commodity. This is why there shouldn&rsquo;t be an excessive duty on cheap merchandise.
In some countries, the duty exceeds 18 times the value of the commodity. In this case, the prince removes the disguise. His subjects plainly see they are dealt with unreasonably.</description>

In an absolute monarchy, only the prince or can have treasure. If wealth is created by others then it is seized by the prince. Thus, banks in an absolute monarchy would suppose money on one side but without any power, and power on the other side but without any means to procure.</description>

Therefore all things have the same causes, because, without substances, modifications and movements do not exist. Further, these causes will probably be soul and body, or reason and desire and body.

He appeared to them to be more beautiful and wise, and to possess a divine gracefulness in a more eminent degree. Hence, he was publicly called upon by his country to benefit all men, by imparting to them what he knew.
Nor was he averse to this request, but endeavoured to introduce the symbolical mode of teaching, in a way perfectly similar to the documents by which he had been instructed in Egypt; though the Samians did not very much admit this mode of tuition, and did not adhere to him with that according aptitude which was requisite.</description>

  According to some, the principle of approbation is founded on a particular faculty of perception.   This is exerted by the mind at the view of actions or affections.
 Some actions affect this faculty agreeably and are stamped as right, laudable, and virtuous. Some actions affect it disagreeably and are stamped as wrong, blamable, and vicious.</description>

Aristomenes&rsquo; death is as much beyond the period of true history as that of Ajax. The common story of Themistocles&rsquo; death was within that period.
However, it bears all the marks of a most romantic fable.
Of all the Greek heroes written by Plutarch, Cleomenes is the only one who died by suicide.</description>

 Custom and fashion can make any physical thing agreeable, no matter how absurd. But custom and fashion can never make a character like Nero or Claudius agreeable  Nero will always be dreaded and hated. Claudius will always be scorned and derided.</description>

                <description>THE monarchies that we know do not have liberty as their goal. Their only aim is the glory of:
 the subject, the state, and the sovereign.  But from these come a spirit of liberty, which can achieve great things in monarchial states, similar to liberty itself.
In a monarchy, the three powers are not distributed on the model of the constitution above-mentioned. They have each a particular distribution, according to which they border more or less on political liberty.</description>

                <description>Socrates Thus, we have found the desired natures. How are they to be reared and educated? This education can prevent injustice from growing in States.  The State Should Censor Immoral and Untruthful Literature and Arts Socrates We shall do this by story-telling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes. The best education is traditional education, which is made up of:
 Gymnastics for the body, and Music and literature, both true and false, for the soul.</description>

                <description>Translators Note= The beginnings of the Wealth of Nations is from this Chapter to Part 4. We can conclude that the rest is to form his work on Jurisprudence
 In an uncivilized nation where labour is undivided, everything is provided for by the natural needs of mankind.
Yet, when the nation is cultivated and labour divided, a more liberal provision is allotted them. This is how a common day-labourer in Britain has more luxury than an Indian sovereign.</description>

                <description>Introduction 4 The Stoics said that every man is first and principally recommended to his own care. Every man=
 is fitter and abler to take care of himself than of any other person, and feels his own pleasures and pains more sensibly than those of others.  His own sensations are his original sensations. These are the substance.
The sensations of others are the reflected or sympathetic images of those sensations.</description>

                <description>The Romans devoted themselves entirely to war, and considered it as the only science. Vegetius says that this inspired them with the idea of the legion.
They judged that it would be necessary to arm the legion&rsquo;s soldiers with weapons stronger and heavier than those of any other nation.
But war also needs light forces. This is why they included a band of light forces with the legions to provoke the enemy to battle, or draw back into it in case of necessity.</description>

                <description>The supporters of the Idea theory were led to it to answer the truth of things. They accepted the Heraclitean sayings which describe all sensible things as ever passing away. If knowledge or thought is to have an object, there must be some other and permanent entities, apart from those which are sensible. There could be no knowledge of things which were in a state of flux.
Socrates occupied himself with the excellences of character and became the first to raise the problem of universal definition.</description>

                <description>Socrates There is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and an absolute essence of all things.
If to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them, finding these ideas to be pre-existent and our inborn possession—then our souls must have had a prior existence, but if not, there would be no force in the argument? There is the same proof that these ideas must have existed before we were born, as that our souls existed before we were born; and if not the ideas, then not the souls.</description>

                <description>One thing has one contrary. How is one opposed to the many? How is equal opposed to the big and the small?
&ldquo;Whether&rdquo; compares opposites. Opposites alone cannot be present together.
Therefore if &ldquo;whether&rdquo; is contrary to the more and the less, then it will be contrary to more things than one.
But if the unequal means the same as both the greater and the less together, the equal will be opposite to both (and the difficulty supports those who say the unequal is a &rsquo;two&rsquo;), but it follows that one thing is contrary to two others, which is impossible.</description>

                <description>Succession has two kinds:
  Testamentary   In testamentary succession, the distribution of goods is done according to the will of the deceased.
 Legal   In legal succession, the law distributes the goods of the deceased to those whom the deceased is presumed to have chosen, according to some lawyers. But this supposes that testamentary succession came before legal succession, which is contrary to experience.
In a rude period, a man rarely had the full property of his goods during his lifetime.</description>

Colleagues in office, partners in trade, call one another brothers. They frequently feel as brothers towards each other.
 Their good agreement is an advantage to all. Their disagreement is a sort of a small scandal.  The Romans expressed this sort of attachment by the word necessitudo.</description>

                <description>How does this division of labour multiply productivity, or, which is the same thing, how does opulence arise from it?
The effect of the division of labour can be seen in some manufactures. If all the parts of a pin were made by one man, it would take him a whole year to make one pin.
He would=
 dig the ore, smelt it, and split the wire.  Therefore, this pin must be sold at the expense of his maintenance for that time.</description>

The prodigious fortune to which the Romans attained, seems incredible to us. Besides, power is at this time divided so disproportionably, that it is not possible for a petty state to raise itself, merely by its own strength, [16] from the low condition in which Providence has placed it.</description>

 Commerce is the exportation and importation of merchandise with a view to the state&rsquo;s advantage. Customs are a right over this exportation and importation, founded also on the state&rsquo;s advantage.  The state should be neutral between its customs and its commerce. These two should not interfere with each other. After this, the people enjoy a free commerce.</description>

                <description>46  The Stoics believed that those who had not attained perfect virtue might have some proficiency in virtue. They organized those proficiencies into different classes, according to their level of advancement. They called the imperfect virtues not as rectitudes, but as proprieties, fitnesses, decent and becoming actions.
 Cicero called these officia. Seneca more exactly called them convenientia  Cicero&rsquo;s Offices wrote about the doctrine of those imperfect, but attainable virtues as &rsquo;the practical morality of the Stoics&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>Socrates Socrates= This shows that high and mighty people find it hard to hold aloof from agriculture. Devotion to it seems to be thrice blest.
Agriculture combines a certain sense of luxury with the satisfaction of an improved estate.
 It trains the body.  The Earth freely offers to those that labour all things necessary to live. If that were not enough, it further contributes luxuries.
We owe to the Earth our many delicacies of meat and vegetables.</description>

                <description>43 The approbation of man&rsquo;s own conscience can content his own weaknesses only during some extraordinary occasions.
The testimony of the impartial spectator cannot always support him alone. Yet its influence and authority is always very great.
It is only by consulting this judge within that we can ever=
 see what relates to ourselves in its proper dimensions, or properly compare between our own interests and those of others.  The Eye of the Impartial Spectator 44 Objects appear big or small to the eye according to their distance from it, not so much according to their real dimensions.</description>

On his first arrival in Italy, according to Nicomachus, being captivated by one popular oration alone, they exceeded two thousand in number.
These, with their wives and children, being collected into one very large and common auditory, called Homacoïon, and which for its magnitude resembled a city, founded a place which was universally called Magna Græcia.
This many people received laws and mandates from Pythagoras as so many divine precepts, and without which they engaged in no occupation, dwelt together with the greatest general concord, celebrated and ranked by their neighbours among the number of the blessed.</description>

If there were no matter, then the universe would have come out of night and &lsquo;all things together&rsquo; and out of non-being.
We have solved these earlier by saying that something has always moved with an unceasing motion in a circle. This is not a theory. This is a fact.
Therefore, the first heaven is eternal. There is therefore also something which moves it.</description>

                <description>Entails engrossed land the most and therefore, it took the longest to be established.
It was very natural to give a man a right to dispose of his property while he lived.
But a testament supposes that he has this right even after death. This right could not be transferred because the heir does not have the same right. Puffendorf whimsically accounts for this from the soul&rsquo;s immortality.
At Rome, the right of making testaments was introduced gradually.</description>

Mr. Loudon was the Professor of Logic in Glasgow College.
 On his death in 1750, Smith was appointed to the vacant chair and began 13 years of active academic work.  It was by far the happiest, most useful, and honourable period of Smith’s life. The appointment was done by a section of the Senatus called the Faculty Professors. Some of them had been Smith’s teachers 10 years before and knew him well.</description>

                <description>AS soon as a republic has compassed the = destruction of those who wanted to subvert it, there should be an end of te= rrors, punishments, and even of rewards.
Great punishments, and consequently grea= t changes, cannot take place without investing some citizens with an exorbi= tant power. It is therefore more adviseable, in this case, to exceed in len= ity, than in severity; to banish but few, rather than many; and to leave th= em their estates, instead of making a vast number of confiscations.</description>

The patricians had engrossed to themselves all public employments. An exorbitant power was annexed to the consulate. The people were often insulted and had no influence left in the public suffrages. These four abuses were redressed by the people.
  It was regulated that the plebeians might aspire to some magistracies and by degrees they were rendered capable of them all, except that of interrex.</description>

                <description>What form of government succeeded the republican?
When small republics were conquered by another state, monarchy, or whatever government the conquerors wanted was established. They generally followed the model of their own country.
 The Athenians always established democracy. The Spartans established aristocracy. The Romans more prudently divided their conquests into provinces.  These were governed pretty absolutely by persons appointed by the Senate. The case is somewhat different when a state is conquered by its own people.</description>

                <description>Since contraries admit of an intermediate and in some cases have it, intermediates must be composed of the contraries.
  All intermediates are in the same genus as the things between which they stand. For we call those things intermediates, into which that which changes must change first; e.g. if we were to pass from the highest string to the lowest by the smallest intervals, we should come sooner to the intermediate notes, and in colours if we were to pass from white to black, we should come sooner to crimson and grey than to black; and similarly in all other cases.</description>

27 Ordinarily, our conduct influences the mood of the society in which we live and have been born and educated. Our society is accordingly, most strongly recommended to us by nature.</description>

                <description>Is this Substance just one? Or is there more than one of It?
The theory of Ideas does not discuss my Substance. Instead, they rely on Ideas and say that the Ideas are numbers which are unlimited. They do not say why there should be so many numbers.
My Substance is not movable either in itself or accidentally. Instead, It produces the primary eternal and single movement.
But since that which is moved must be moved by something, and the first mover must be in itself unmovable, and eternal movement must be produced by something eternal and a single movement by a single thing, and since we see that besides the simple spatial movement of the universe, which we say the first and unmovable substance produces, there are other spatial movements-those of the planets-which are eternal (for a body which moves in a circle is eternal and unresting; we have proved these points in the physical treatises), each of these movements also must be caused by a substance both unmovable in itself and eternal.</description>

                <description>The division of labour cannot be the effect of human prudence. The Sesostris made a law that every man should follow the employment of his father. But this=
 is not suitable to the dispositions of human nature and can never long take place.  Everyone is fond of being a gentleman, whatever his father&rsquo;s employment. The strongest and those above the weak in society must have as many under as to defend their station.</description>

                <description>A common misconception was that Smith was helpless in business.
One of his Edinburgh neighbours told Robert Chambers that Smith wrote so well on exchange and barter. But that it was strange that he was obliged to get a friend to buy his horse corn for him.
This idea of his helplessness in the petty transactions arose from observing his=
 occasional fits of absence and  His fits of absence do not seem so frequent nor so prolonged as they are commonly represented.</description>

                <description>The nature of the divine thought involves certain problems.
Thought is the most divine of things observed by us.
If it thinks of nothing, what is there here of dignity?
It is just like one who sleeps. And if it thinks, but this depends on something else, then (since that which is its substance is not the act of thinking, but a potency) it cannot be the best substance; for it is through thinking that its value belongs to it.</description>

                <description>Two things are required in voluntary transference=
 A declaration of the intention of the transferer, and of the transferee The actual delivery of the thing.  In most cases, the first of these is not binding without the latter, because there is no right without possession.
If a man borrowed a thing and afterwards bought it, there is no need of delivery because he already has it.
Before possession you can have no right to the thing, though you may have a right to make the man keep his promise.</description>

 wisdom courage temperance justice.  Wisdom is the first virtue found in a State. It means being good in counsel. Good counsel is a kind of knowledge because ignorant men cannot counsel well. There are many and diverse kinds of knowledge in a State, such as the knowledge carpentry.</description>

At the beginning of our enquiry, there was justice tumbling about at our feet yet we never saw her. We are like people who go about looking for what was already in their hands.
The original principle at the foundation of the State is that one man should practise one thing only whatever his nature was best adapted to.</description>

He stroked my head, and pressed the hair upon my neck—he had a way of playing with my hair.
 Socrates We should both shave our locks today.
If I were you, and the argument got away from me, and I could not hold my ground against Simmias and Cebes, I would myself take an oath, like the Argives, not to wear hair any more until I had renewed the conflict and defeated them.</description>

Why a female and a male animal are not different in species, though this difference belongs to animal in virtue of its own nature, and not as paleness or darkness does; both &lsquo;female&rsquo; and &lsquo;male&rsquo; belong to it qua animal.

It was just enough to render that situation as objects of=
 simple preference, but not of earnest desire, simple rejection, but not of earnest aversion.  The certainty by which our happiness settles to match our permanent situation would make us think that the Stoics were correct.</description>

                <description>Every science seeks certain principles and causes for each of its objects-e.g. medicine and gymnastics and each of the other sciences, whether productive or mathematical.
Each of these marks off a certain class of things for itself and busies itself about this as about something existing and real,-not however qua real; the science that does this is another distinct from these. Of the sciences mentioned each gets somehow the &lsquo;what&rsquo; in some class of things and tries to prove the other truths, with more or less precision.</description>

                <description>72  The system which makes virtue consist in benevolence is very ancient, but not as ancient as those of the Greeks.
It was the doctrine of most of the Eclectics, after the age of Augustus. They pretended to follow the opinions of Plato and Pythagoras. Thus, they are commonly known as Platonists.
 73  According to them in the divine nature, benevolence or love was the sole principle of action which directed all the other attributes.</description>

                <description>The division of labour must always be proportioned to the extent of commerce.
If 10 people only want a certain commodity, its manufacture will never be as divided as one that had 1,000 wanting it.
The division of labour always becomes more perfect by the easy method of transportation in a country. The progress of commerce must be stopped if the road=
 is infested with robbers, and is deep and transportation is not easy.</description>

 The people were subjected to a simple tribute, paid and collected with ease. They were far happier in obeying a barbarous nation than a corrupt government that enslaved them.

                <description>Socrates The same principle holds in the sciences. The object of science is knowledge. But the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge.
The science of house-building is a kind of knowledge different from other kinds. It is therefore called &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; because it has a particular quality which no other has. It has this particular quality because it has a particular object. This is true of the other arts and sciences.</description>

The prince himself derives so very littl e advantage from those commissioners, that it is not worth while to change, for their sake, the common course of things. He is morally sure that he ha s more of the spirit of probity and justice than his commissioners, who thi nk themselves sufficiently justified by his nomination and orders, by a vag ue interest of state, and even by their very apprehensions.</description>

                <description>In Glasgow, Smith was a teacher and a learner. The conditions of time and place were most favourable for his instruction.
Had he remained at Oxford, he would probably never have been an economist. had he not spent so many of his best years in Glasgow, he would never have been such an eminent one. He grew into a great economist amid=
 the thickening problems of the Clyde’s rising trade, and the daily discussions they occasioned among the town’s enterprising and intelligent merchants.</description>

 allows the prince to press or retard the levy of the taxes, either according to his own wants or to those of his people saves the state the immense profits of tax collectors [tax farmers], who impoverish it a thousand ways lets the prince prevent the people from being mortified with the sight of sudden fortunes lets the public money pass through few hands, go directly to the treasury, and consequently makes a quicker return to the people.</description>

The soil of every country is commonly possessed by the natives.

                <description>Exclusive privileges are the last division of real rights. Among these is the right of inheritance. This is not a creature of the civil law, but arises from nature.
The heir has a privilege of demanding what belonged to the deceased. After he is admitted heir, it is his real property. If a person starts to chase a wild beast, he has an exclusive privilege of pursuing it. Whoever comes in on the chase can be punished because he breaks the exclusive privilege.</description>

                <description>108 The general rules which distribute prosperity and adversity are perfectly suited to mankind&rsquo;s situation. Yet they are not suited to some of our natural feelings.
We naturally love some virtues so much that we want to give them honours. On the contrary, we detest some vices so much that we want to give them every disgrace. Magnanimity, generosity, and justice, command so much admiration.
We want to see them crowned with wealth, power, and honours.</description>

                <description>If the categories are classified as substance, quality, place, acting or being acted on, relation, quantity, there must be three kinds of movement-of quality, of quantity, of place.
There is no movement in respect of substance (because there is nothing contrary to substance), nor of relation (for it is possible that if one of two things in relation changes, the relative term which was true of the other thing ceases to be true, though this other does not change at all,-so that their movement is accidental), nor of agent and patient, or mover and moved, because there is no movement of movement nor generation of generation, nor, in general, change of change.</description>

 the quantity of goods and the facility of barter  The more money that is needed to circulate the goods of any country, the fewer the goods.
Suppose Scotland&rsquo;s total stock of corn, cattle, money, etc. amounts to 20 million.
 If 1 million in cash is needed to circulate it, there will only be 19 million of food, clothes, and lodging.</description>

                <description>Smith enjoyed a very high Scotch reputation long before his name was known to the public by any literary contribution. But in 1759 he gave his Theory of Moral Sentiments to the press. He then took his place in the first rank of contemporary writers, by almost immediate and universal recognition.
The book is an essay supporting and illustrating the doctrine that moral approbation and disapprobation are in the last analysis expressions of sympathy with the feelings of an imaginary and impartial spectator.</description>

                <description>The House of Commons became considerable. But how did the nobility’s power decrease and how did the government become arbitrary?
Previously by their ancient rustic hospitality, all the European courts could easily maintain 1,000 retainers. Richard, Earl of Warwick was styled as a King. He maintained 40,000 people everyday besides tenants.
But when luxury took place, he was unable to do this. Thus, the nobility&rsquo;s power was reduced before the House of Commons had established its authority through an arbitrary king.</description>

A promise:

                <description>Because of these tenets, the government banned coin exportation.
This ban has been extremely hurtful to the country&rsquo;s commerce. Because whatever amount of money there is in any country above what is needed for circulation is merely a dead stock.
In King William’s time, there were two species of coin=
 milled unmilled  The unmilled was frequently clipped while in circulation. This caused frequent disorders among the people. The parliament ordered all the clipped money to be brought into the mint.</description>

Socrates Of course, of course, you are naturally most careful not to forfeit the title they have given you of &ldquo;honest gentleman&rdquo;; (2) and yet, I daresay, fifty things at home are asking your attention at this moment; only you undertook to meet your foreign friends, and rather than play them false you go on waiting.</description>

Hence, he asked how they associated with their parents, and the rest of their relatives.
He then surveyed:
 their unseasonable laughter, their silence, and their speaking when it was not proper. their desires with whom they associated how they conversed with them how they employed their leisure time, and what were the subjects of their joy and grief.</description>

Period | Leader +++ | +++ 1533 | Henry 7th 1558 | Elizabeth 1603 | James I 1649 | Charles I
Henry 7th allowed the nobility to dispose of their estates. This placed them on a level with the commons.
Elizabeth was a popular leader and so she was continually unwilling to impose taxes on her subjects. To supply her exigencies, she sold the royal demesnes, as she knew that none of her offspring was to succeed her.</description>

or is there aught else which he must learn in order to play the part of an efficient bailiff?
 Most certainly there is (he answered)= it still remains for him to learn particulars—to know, that is, what things he has to do, and when and how to do them; or else, if ignorant of these details, the profit of this bailiff in the abstract may prove no greater than the doctor&rsquo;s who pays a most precise attention to a sick man, visiting him late and early, but what will serve to ease his patient&rsquo;s pains (2) he knows not.</description>

For this would be uncommunicative and unjust. While therefore he imparted a convenient portion of his discourses to each, he benefited as much as possible all of them, and preserved the proportion of justice, by making each a partaker of the auditions according to his desert.
Hence, he called some of them Pythagoreans, but others Pythagorists just as we denominate some men Attics, but others Atticists.</description>

He delivered an appropriate portion of wisdom conformable to the proper nature and power of each. The following is an example.
Abaris, an old Scythian, came from the Hyperboreans, unskilled and uninitiated in the Grecian learning. Pythagoras put him through trials and immediately considered him adapted to be an auditor of his dogmas. He instructed him in the shortest way in his:

                <description>THE Persians, during this period, were in a much better situation than the Romans. They had little reason to fear the northern people because mount Taurus, which extends between the Caspian and Euxine seas, separated them.
They effectively closed a very narrow pass which was the only way for the cavalry. In every other part, the Barbarians had to descend from frightful precipices and leave their horses. They were blocked in by the Araxes, a deep river which flows from west to east.</description>

                <description>Smith joined his pupil in London in the end of January 1764. They set out for France in the start of February.
They remained abroad 2.5 years=
 10 days in Paris, 18 months in Toulouse, 2 months traveling in the South of France, 2 months in Geneva, and 10 months in Paris again.  Smith kept no journal and wrote as few letters as possible. But from various sources, we can fill in some of the outlines of their travel.</description>

                <description>In England and Europe after the feudal law was introduced, governance was done in the same way as a baron in his jurisdiction. The baron was a steward who managed all affairs in his lord&rsquo;s county.
The grand justiciary managed all justice in the kingdom.
 He appointed sheriffs and other inferior officers. He was himself a great lord. He became as powerful as the king in every country except in England.</description>

or even though possessed of all the qualifications you have named, does he still lack something?
 Most certainly (replied Ischomachus). One thing is still required of him, and that is to hold aloof from property and goods which are his master&rsquo;s; he must not steal.
Socrates Consider, this is the very person through whose hands the fruits and produce pass, and he has the audacity to make away with them!</description>

                <description>The absurd notion that national opulence consists in money has another bad effect &ndash; it makes people think that whatever people spend locally cannot reduce public opulence.
Dr. Mandeville created a system that private vices are public benefits. It believes that what we spend at home is all spent among ourselves and that none of it goes out of the country.
But if everyone wears, tears, and spends his stock, without doing any industry, then the nation is made so much the poorer at the end of the year.</description>

                <description>14 The point of propriety is the degree of any passion which the impartial spectator approves of. This point is differently situated in different passions.
 In some passions, the excess is less disagreeable than the shortage.
 In such passions, the point of propriety seems to stand high, or nearer to the excess than to the shortage.
 In other passions, the shortage is less disagreeable than the excess.</description>

                <description>In the end of August, Smith and his pupils left Toulouse and made an extensive tour in the South of France. (Stewart) No other record remains of this tour.
Lady Mary Coke was the Duke’s aunt. She mentions that when they were at Marseilles they visited the porcelain factory. The Duke bought two of the largest services ever sold there, for which he paid more than £150 sterling. They seem to have arrived in Geneva some time in October.</description>

                <description>What is the origin of the little European republics and the rights of sovereign and subject?
The Origin of Republics In some countries, the provinces far from the seat of government sometimes became independent. This was the case in most of Germany and France during Charlemagne&rsquo;s time.
Hugh Capet was chief justiciary. He got the government into his hands, but took only the title of the King of France.
The Pope raised disturbances in Germany.</description>

                <description>22  The principle of self-estimation may be too high or too low.
We like to think highly of ourselves. We feel that some excessive regard is better than any shortage.
But it is different to the impartial spectator. To him, the shortage is less disagreeable than the excess.
We frequently complain of the excess than the shortage.
 When they set themselves before us, their self-estimation mortifies our own.</description>

                <description>How did Pythagoras teach his students?
  First, he tested them if they were able to refrain from speaking. He surveyed whether they could conceal in silence and preserve what they had learnt and heard.
  Second, he observed whether they were modest.
  He was much more anxious that they should be silent than that they should speak. He likewise directed his attention to every other particular; such, as whether they were astonished by the energies of any immoderate passion or desire.</description>

                <description>Amidst the general confusion of affairs, Phocas became unsettled in his new dignity. Heraclius came from Africa and murdered him and found the provinces invaded and the legions destroyed.
As soon as he remedied these disasters, the Arabians extended the Islamic empire founded by Mohammed.
No people ever made so rapid a progress. They immediately conquered Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Africa, and then turned against the Persians.
God permitted his religion to be laid low, in so many places where it once had been predominant; not that it now ceased to be the object of his providential care, but because it always either in its state of glory or depression produces its natural effect, which is the sanctification of the soul.</description>

                <description>Pythagoras also exhorted to remove contention and strife from true friendship, and especially from all friendship, if possible.
But if this is not possible, at least expel it from:
 paternal friendship, and universally from the friendship with elders and benefactors.  Contending with your friends because of anger or some other similar passion destroys the existing friendship.
But the smallest lacerations and ulcerations should happen in friendships. This will happen if both friends know how to yield and subdue their anger, and especially the younger of the two belonging to some one of the above-mentioned orders.</description>

The Rev. William Cole was in Paris in October 1765. He notes in his journal on October 26 that the Duke of Buccleugh arrived in Paris that day from Spa along with the Earl and Countess of Fife;
But this must be a mistake, for Horace Walpole was also in Paris that autumn.
He writes on December 5 that the Duke was then expected to arrive the following week.</description>

                <description>How could the Greek empire possibly subsist so long?
The Arabs invaded the empire and conquered several provinces. Their chiefs became competitors for the Khalisa, and the flame of their first zeal only burst out in civil dissensions.
The Arabs also conquered Persia andthe Greeks were no longer obliged to keep the principal forces of the empire stationed on the banks of the Euphrates.

                <description>It is commonly supposed that the premium of interest depends on the value of gold and silver. The value of these are regulated by their quantity. As the quantity increases, the value diminishes. As the quantity decreases, the value rises.
However, the premium of interest is regulated by the quantity of stock.
Around the time of the discovery of the West Indies, the common interest was at 10% or 12%. Since that time, it has gradually diminished.</description>

                <description>What is the duty of the sovereign? What is the proper punishment of disobedience?
Every attempt to overturn this power is considered as the greatest crime in every nation. It is called high treason. There is a great difference between treason in monarchies and treason in republics.
 In monarchies, treason is an attempt on the king. In republics, treason is an attempt on the people&rsquo;s liberties.  This is why the maxim of assassination came to be established in republics, and not in monarchies.</description>

In Rome, a family might be peregrina for four or five generations.
At Athens, no man was a citizen unless both father and mother were Athenians. The Athenians were particularly sparing in giving the right of citizenship, because it entitled them to very great privileges.</description>

                <description>Nutrition greatly contributes to the best discipline when properly used.
Pythagoras instituted as a law the rejection of all such food as is flatulent, and the cause of perturbation. But he approved of food contrary to this. He ordered it to be used, viz. such food as composes and compresses the habit of the body.
Thus, the millet was a plant adapted to nutrition. But he altogether rejected such food as is foreign to the Gods; because it withdraws us from familiarity with the Gods.</description>

                <description>40  It is quite otherwise with the vain man.
 He courts the company of his superiors as much as the proud man shuns it. He thinks that their splendour reflects a splendour on those who are around them. He haunts the courts of kings and the levees of ministers. He gives himself the air of being a candidate for fortune and preferment.  In reality, he possesses the more precious happiness of not being one, if he knew how to enjoy it.</description>

He was accustomed to employ a purification of this kind, but not in a careless way.
d he called the medicine which is obtained through music by the name of purification. But he employed such a melody as this about the vernal season.
For he placed in the middle a certain person who played on the lyre, and seated in a circle round him those who were able to sing.</description>

                <description>When Smith left Glasgow, his mother and cousin went back again to Kirkcaldy. He remained with them there for the next 11 years.
Hume thought that the countryside was unsuitable for a man of letters. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to move to Edinburgh. But Smith had everything he needed in Kirkcaldy=
 his work his mother his books his daily walks in the sea breeze  Edinburgh always in the offing as a place of occasional resort.</description>

                <description>Pythagoras invented the harmonic science and harmonic ratios.
He wanted to invent a tool to aid the hearing which would be as firm and unerring as:
 a ruler or compass is unerring to the eyes. a dioptric instrument by Jupiter a balance scale  As he was walking near a brazier’s shop, he heard from a certain divine casualty the hammers beating out a piece of iron on an anvil.</description>

                <description>1773-1776. Aet. 50-53
In the spring of 1773, Smith virtually completed the Wealth of Nations. He thought of going to London with the manuscript, to give it to a publisher.
But his labours had taken its toll on his health and spirits.
 He thought that he might die suddenly before it got published. He wrote Hume before he went to London. He made Hume his literary executor. He gave him directions on the destination of the various unpublished manuscripts in his depositories=  My Dear Friend—</description>

                <description>The Crotonians used to be impelled to make sumptuous funerals and interments.
Someone said to them that he had heard Pythagoras say that the Olympian Gods attended to the dispositions of those who sacrificed, and not to the number of the sacrifices. On the contrary, the terrestrial Gods, as being allotted the government of things less important, rejoiced in banquets and lamentations, and farther still, in continual libations, in delicacies, and in celebrating funerals with great expense.</description>

                <description>The Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was at length published on March 9, 1776.
Bishop Horne was one of Smith’s antagonists.
 He said the books which live longest are those which have been carried longest in the parent’s womb.  The Wealth of Nations took 12 years to write.
 It was in contemplation probably 12 years before that. It was explicitly and publicly promised in 1759, in the concluding paragraph of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, though it is only the partial fulfilment of that promise.</description>

Let this, therefore, be one specimen of his piety, which also we have before mentioned, that he knew what his soul was, and whence it came into the body, and also its former lives, and that of these things he gave most evident indications.
After this also, let the following be another specimen; that once passing over the river Nessus with many of his associates, he spoke to it, and the river in a distinct and clear voice, in the hearing of all his followers, answered, Hail Pythagoras!</description>

                <description>Unenlightened Humans Socrates Let me show how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened.
Imagine humans living in a underground cave. Its mouth is open towards the light which reaches all along the cave.
They:
 have lived inside the cave from childhood have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move can only see in front of them   Socrates The chains prevent them from moving their heads.</description>

                <description>After the publication of his book in the beginning of March, Smith still dallied in London, without going to see Hume in Edinburgh then bring him to London.
But some hope seems to have been entertained of Hume coming up even without Smith&rsquo;s persuasion and escort.
Bishop John Home thought so. He was in London and was in correspondence with Hume. But Hume wrote no, in a letter on April 12.</description>

The process is not the turning over of an oyster-shell. This is an allusion to a game where two parties fled or pursued depending on whether an oyster-shell thrown in the air fell with the dark or light side. The process is to turn a soul from twilight into the true day of being.</description>

If this is right then every other is wrong. The evil is one which affects not only the order of the State, but also the regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.  I was about to tell how the four evil forms succeed one another, when Polemarchus, sitting just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him.</description>

                <description>How the Timocracts Become Oligarchs Socrates An oligarchic government is one resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it. The rulers are elected for their wealth.
I shall explain the transition from timocracy to oligarchy.
The accumulation of gold in private individuals is the ruin of timocracy. They invent illegal modes of expenditure because they do not care about the law.</description>

                <description>Smith remained at Kirkcaldy from May to December 1776, except for occasional visits to Edinburgh or Dalkeith.
But his thoughts, were again bent on London, as soon as his mother’s health allowed him to leave home. He seems to have enjoyed London. It inspired some hopes in friends like Strahan that he might even settle there permanently. After his departure for Scotland in April, Strahan used to write him of political news keeping him abreast of all that was going on.</description>

                <description>Of his wisdom, however, the commentaries written by the Pythagoreans afford, in short, the greatest indication; for they adhere to truth in every thing, and are more concise than all other compositions, so that they savour of the ancient elegance of style, and the conclusions are exquisitely deduced with divine science.
They are also replete with the most condensed conceptions, and are in other respects various and diversified both in the form and the matter.</description>

                <description>On settling in Edinburgh, Smith took a house in the Canongate—Panmure House. It was at the foot of Panmure Close, one of the steep and narrow wynds that descend from the north side of the Canongate towards the base of the Calton Hill.
This house was his home for the rest of his days. He died in it. The Canongate was the old Court end of Edinburgh. At the end of the 18th century, it was still its fashionable residential quarter.</description>

                <description>Socrates Next comes democracy. How does oligarchy change into democracy? Is it wise or not?
Oligarchy aims at a good of becoming as rich as possible. The rulers are aware that their power rests on their wealth. They will refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain from their ruin. They take interest from them. They buy up their estates and increase their own wealth and importance.</description>

                <description>Pythagoras cultivated justice and delivered it to mankind. How did he avoid injustice?
For thus we shall discover how he avoided the latter, and what methods he adopted in order that the former might be properly ingenerated in the soul.
The principle of justice is the common and the equal, through which, in a way most nearly approximating to one body and one soul, all men may be co-passive, and may call the same thing mine and thine; as is also testified by Plato, who learnt this from the Pythagoreans.</description>

                <description>Unity is the greatest good Socrates What should be the chief aim of the legislator of a State? What is the greatest good and the greatest evil?
Discord, distraction, and plurality is the greatest evil where there should be unity. The bond of unity is the greatest good. There is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains, where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow.</description>

Earlier, we said that:
 every physical perception has a metaphysical idea-equivalent each idea produces an opposite idea: beauty has ugliness, health has disease a mind is an arena to experience such perceptions and ideas all our minds are inside a larger mind which we call the Matrix and is roughly equivalent to the Brahma by the Hindus, the Tao by the Taoists, Sunya by the Buddhists, and the Whole by Parmenides  Notice how the Matrix, Brahma, Tao, and the Whole are impersonal.</description>

                <description>Treatise On Ethical Erudition Virtue is sufficient to prevent infelicity. Vice leads to the non-attainment of felicity. The bad man is always miserable whether he is in affluence, for he employs it badly; or whether he is in penury; just as the blind man, whether he has light, and the most splendid visible object before him, or whether he is in the dark [is always necessarily without sight].
But the good man is not always happy, for felicity does not consist in the possession, but in the use of virtue.</description>

                <description>The remaining portion of my Ethics is concerned with the way leading to freedom. For this, I shall treat the power of the reason, showing=
 how far it can control the emotions, and what is the nature of Mental Freedom or Blessedness.  We can then see how much more powerful the wise man is than the ignorant. I do not intend=
 to point out the method and means for perfecting the understanding This question is in the area of Logic.</description>

r &gt; g
A market economy based on private property, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence, associated in particular with the diffusion of knowledge and skills. It also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to=
 democratic societies the values of social justice on which they are based.  The principal destabilizing force is rate of return on private capital r being significantly higher for long periods than the rate of growth of income and output g.</description>

                <description>Taxes on possessions are naturally equal. But taxes on consumptions are naturally unequal. Sometimes they are paid by:
 the merchant the consumer, or the importer, who must be repaid it by the consumer.  In Holland, all goods are deposited in a public warehouse, one key of which is kept by the commissioner of the customs, and another by the owner of the goods. If the goods are exported, no tax is advanced.</description>

                <description>Treatise On Prudence And Prosperity Prudence and prosperity subsist, with reference to each other, as follows= Prudence indeed is effable and possesses reason; for it is something orderly and definite. But prosperity is ineffable and irrational; for it is something disorderly and indefinite. And prudence, indeed, is prior, but prosperity is posterior in beginning and in power. For the former is naturally adapted to govern and define; but the latter to be governed and defined.</description>

                <description>Preface Bondage is the human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions.
When a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master. He lies at the mercy of fortune. He is often compelled, while seeing that which is better for him, to follow that which is worse. I will show in this part of my treatise=
 why this is so, and what is good or evil in the emotions.</description>

                <description>The third kind of personal rights are ex delicto.
Delicts are of two kinds=
 they arise ex dolo when there is a blameable intention, or ex culpa when they are done through a culpable negligence.  Injury naturally excites the resentment of the spectator, and the punishment of the offender is reasonable as far as the indifferent spectator can go along with it. This is the natural measure of punishment.</description>

                <description>Descartes was the first who tried to ascertain precisely this invisible chain that Kepler said to link the planets to the sun.
He explained that the real inertness of matter was=
 not in an aversion to motion and not in a propensity to rest  The real inertness of matter was in a power=
 of continuing indifferently either at rest or in motion, and of resisting, with a certain force, whatever tried to change its state from the one to the other  All of space was full of aether.</description>

                <description>Socrates Motion has many forms. Two of them are obvious to ordinary people.
There are others which may be left to wiser persons.
These two are the study of motions from sight and sound*. The eyes are designed to look up at the stars, just as the ears are designed to hear harmonious motions.
These are sister sciences, as the Pythagoreans say.
  *Superphysics Note: The study of visible motion deals with particles, the study of audible motion deals with waves.</description>

                <description>When everyone went out, there could be no military discipline.
They were all on the same level. Discipline was unnecessary because their common cause was so well discerned. When the highest orders went out, a principle of honour would supply the place of discipline. But when this office fell on the lowest order, the most severe and rigid discipline became necessary.
Accordingly, discipline has been introduced into all standing armies.</description>

In countries which have little commerce, such as Wales or the Scottish highlands on the contrary, they are very common.

                <description>The perfect life of man falls short of the life of God, because it is not self-perfect. But it surpasses that of irrational animals, because it has virtue and felicity.
For neither is God in want of external causes; since being naturally good and happy, he is perfect from himself; nor any irrational animal.
Brutes have no reason and no science pertaining to actions.

                <description>The Pythagorean Eurytus and his followers beheld the images of things themselves in numbers. They rightly attributed certain numbers to certain things, according to their peculiarity.
A particular number is the boundary of this plant, and again, another number of this animal; just as of a triangle 6 is the boundary, of a square 9, and of a cube 8.
The musician harmonizes his lyre through mathematical numbers. Likewise, nature harmonizes hers through her own natural numbers, orderly arranges, and modulates her productions.</description>

                <description>Socrates Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny and the tyrant.
How does tyranny arise? Does tyranny spring from democracy in the same way as democracy from oligarchy?
The excess of wealth was the good which oligarchy proposed to itself. Oligarchy was maintained by that wealth. The insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy.</description>

                <description>The laws of governance should be relative to the principle of each government, just as the laws of education are.
The relation of laws to this principle strengthens the several springs of government. This principle derives from thence, in its turn, a new degree of vigour.
And thus it is, in mechanics, that action is al ways followed by re-action.
We examine this relation in each government, beginning with the republican state, whose principle is virtue.</description>

Machiavel says that the few are corrupted by a few.
I agree to his maxim.
When a few people decide, the political interest prevails over the civil because it is always inconvenient for the people to be judges in their own cause.</description>

                <description>EXCESSIVE punishments may even corrupt a despotic government as seen in Japan.
There, almost all crimes are punished with death because disobedience to the great Japanese emperor is reckoned an enormous crime. The question is not so much to correct the delinquent, as to vindicate the emperor&rsquo;s authority.
These notions:
 are derived from servitude come mainly from the emperor being the universal proprietor.  These render almost all crimes to be directly against his interests.</description>

Introduction Pythagoras was the father of philosophy.
Plato is the most genuine and the best of all his disciples.
Pythagoras&rsquo; biographer, Iamblichus, is well known to every Platonist that he was seen by them as divine.</description>

                <description>The rules which nations should observe, or do observe with one another, cannot be treated so accurately as private or public law.
The rules of property are pretty exactly established in every nation.
The extent of the sovereign’s power and the subject&rsquo;s duty, so far as justice is concerned, are pretty uniform everywhere.
But with respect to the laws of nations, we cannot mention any one regulation=
 established with the common consent of all nations, and observed at all times.</description>

Kepler, in Germany, had great genius but none of the taste or order and method of Galileo. Like other Germans, he had the most laborious industry together with an excessive passion for discovering proportions and resemblances between the different parts of nature.</description>

                <description>Socrates Then let us enact this law that our guardians are neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.  Glaucon Yes, these and all our previous enactments, are very good. But how can it be done?
Your citizens will be the bravest of warriors. They will all know one another and will call the other father, brother, son. If the women will join their armies then they will be absolutely invincible.</description>

                <description>Good is Not Pleasure Socrates The person who wants to see the soul in its perfect beauty must take a longer route to find such beauty in it.
But beauty is the same as opinion which needs a measure common to all. Indolent people use measures based on their own limited perceptions.
This would be the worst fault in a guardian and of the laws.
The guardian then must be required to take the longer circuit.</description>

                <description>Many think that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, but they differ as to the latter&rsquo;s race.  Some think he was a Samian. Neanthes, in the fifth book of his Fables, states he was a Syrian from Tyre.
Samos had a famine so Mnesarchus went there to trade and was naturalized there. His son Pythagoras was then born. He manifested studiousness and was later taken to Tyre and entrusted to the Chaldeans, whose doctrines he imbibed.</description>

                <description>Master and servant is the third relation of a family. The same principle which gave the husband authority over the wife, also gave the father authority over the son. The husband&rsquo;s power was softened through his wife’s friends. She could complain to them. The father was softened by the same means.
But it was not so with the servants who had nobody to complain to. The master had the power of life and death over them.</description>

                <description>11  A species of farmers known as Metayers in France gradually succeeded the ancient slaves.
They are called Coloni Partiarii in Latin. They were so long in disuse in England that I know no English name for them at present.
 The proprietor furnished them with the whole stock needed for cultivating the farm. After setting aside what was necessary for keeping up the stock, the produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer.</description>

                <description>Virtue is the perfection of human nature.
For every being becomes perfect, and arrives at the summit of excellence according to the proper nature of its virtue.
Thus, a horse&rsquo;s virtue is that which leads to the perfection of the nature of a horse.
The same reasoning is applicable to the parts of a thing.
Thus, the virtue of the eyes is acuteness of vision.
This in the nature of the eyes is the summit.</description>

The principles of music are explained below:
Take two brazen chords, such as are used in harps. The chords made from sheep intestines are false or obnoxious to the change of the air.
A———————B C———————D | E
These chords should be perfectly equal and equally stretched, so as to be in unison. There may be only one sound, though there are two strings.</description>

In a republic, public employments are attestations of virtue, depositums with which a citizen is entrusted by his country, for whose sake alone he ought to live, to act, and to think; consequently, he cannot refuse them¶.</description>

                <description>Chapter 9= The Severity of Punishments in different Governments. THE severity of punishments is fitter for despotic governments, whose principle is terror, than for a monarchy or a republic, whose spring is honour and virtue.
In moderate governments, the love of one’s country, shame, and the fear of blame, are restraining motives, capable of preventing a multitude of crimes. Here the greatest punishment of a bad action is conviction. The civil laws have, therefore, a softer way of correcting, and do not require so much force and severity.</description>

                <description>LUXURY indicates the inequality of fortunes.
If the riches of a state are equally divided, there will be no luxury, because luxury is founded merely on the inconveniences from the labour of others.
In order to have this equal distribution of riches, the law should give to each man only what is necessary for nature. If they exceed these bounds, some will spend, and others will acquire. These will lead to inequality.</description>

The authority of the father over his children, both with respect to liberty and property, was at first absolute. He was at liberty to choose whether he would bring up his children or not, and it was accounted no injustice to refuse to do it.</description>

The exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized. Similarly, philosophy grown in a bad soil degenerates and receives another character.
But if philosophy ever finds perfection in a State, then she will be seen in truth divine and that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are but human.</description>

                <description>Justice may be called the mother and the nurse of the other virtues.
Without this, a man can neither be temperate, nor brave, nor prudent.
It is the harmony and peace, in conjunction with elegance, of the whole soul.
The strength of this virtue will become more manifest, if we direct our attention to the other habits.
For they have a partial utility, and which is referred to one thing; but this is referred to whole systems, and to a multitude.</description>

                <description>In many countries, men took as many wives as they could maintain.
Voluntary divorce has inconveniences. Yet it is still within justice that a man should divorce his wife and take another for less reasons than adultery, because they make them quite unhappy together though either of them might live well elsewhere.
The same is the case with polygamy. If a woman consents to be one of five or more wives and the law allows it, then there is no injury done to her.</description>

Imagination is an idea which indicates the human body&rsquo;s present disposition, than the nature of the external body not distinctly, but confusedly. Whence it comes to pass, that the mind is said to err.  We are only passive, in so far as we are apart of Nature, which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts.</description>

Desire arising from the knowledge of good and bad can be quenched or checked by many of the other desires arising from the emotions whereby we are assailed.  Desire arising from the knowledge of good and evil, in so far as such knowledge regards what is future, may be more easily controlled or quenched, than the desire for what is agreeable at the present moment.</description>

No individual thing, which is entirely different from our own nature, can help or check our power of activity, and absolutely nothing can do us good or harm, unless it has something in common with our nature. 30. A thing cannot be bad for us through the quality which it has in common with our nature, but it is bad for us in so far as it is contrary to our nature.</description>

                <description>Whatsoever the mind understands under the form of eternity, it does not understand by virtue of conceiving the present actual existence of the body, but by virtue of conceiving the essence of the body under the form of eternity.  Note.—Things are conceived by us as actual in two ways; either as existing in relation to a given time and place, or as contained in God and following from the necessity of the divine nature.</description>

We have already therefore narrated the common precepts concerning it, in which it is said that every thing incommensurate should be cut off with fire and sword. The abstinence also from animal food, is a precept of the same species; and likewise from certain foods calculated to produce intemperance, and impeding the vigilance and genuine energies of the reasoning power.</description>

Do not even think of doing what should not be done. Choose rather to be strong in soul than in body.
Be persuaded that things of a laborious nature contribute more than pleasures to virtue.
Every passion of the soul is most hostile to its salvation. It is difficult to walk at one and the same time in many paths of life.</description>

                <description>As we live through soul, it must be said that by the virtue of this we live well; just as because we see through the eyes, we see well through the virtue of these.
It must not be thought that gold can be injured by rust, or virtue by baseness.
We should betake ourselves to virtue as to an inviolable temple, in order that we may not be exposed to any ignoble insolence of soul with respect to our communion with, and continuance in life.</description>

 By being captives in war.   If the conqueror does not kill them, he has a right to make them slaves.  By being children of slaves. By being guilty of crimes.   They becames slaves to the person injured or to the public.  By being in debt in the ancient state of the Roman Republic.

                <description>In this way, standing armies came to be introduced.
Armies should be raised:
 in the most convenient way, and with the least possible hurt to the country.  Many standing armies may be exclaimed against. But they must be introduced in a certain period of society. A militia commanded by landed gentlemen in possession of the nation&rsquo;s public offices would never sacrifice the country&rsquo;s liberties for anyone.
Such a militia would be the best security against a foreign standing army.</description>

                <description>The practice of stock-jobbing is the buying stocks by time.
It also has a very big influence on the rise and fall of stocks. A man who only has £1,000 subscribes for £100,000, which is delivered=
 at several fixed times, and in certain portions.  He hopes to sell these portions at profit by the rising of the stocks before they fall. But since his worth would go down if the stocks fall, he does everything to make them rise.</description>

                <description>Soon after the Revolution, the government needed to borrow money from its subjects at a higher rate than common interest.
It had to be repaid in a few years. The funds to pay this interest were taxes on certain commodities. These taxes were at first laid on for a certain number of years, according to the term for which the money was borrowed. But these loans became perpetual by various arts of government.</description>

 the most commercial, and the most faithful to their word.  The English are more so than the Scotch, but much inferior to the Dutch.
In the remote parts of Britain, they are far less so than in its commercial parts.</description>

                <description>IT is an essential point, that there should be a certain proportion in punishments, because it is essential that a great crime should be avoided rather than a smaller, and that which is more pernicious to society rather than that which is less.

                <description>Chapter 6: The Luxury of China SUMPTUARY laws might be necessary in some governments.
The population may grow so large because of the climate. The uncertainty of food might render a universal application to agriculture extremely necessary.
Luxury, in such countries, is dangerous. This would cause their sumptuary laws to be very severe.
In order, therefore, to be able to judge whether luxury ou ght to be encouraged or proscribed, we should examine, first, what relation there is between the number of people and the facility they have of procur ing subsistence.</description>

 They became the judges in peace and the leaders in war of all who dwelt on their estates. They could maintain order and execute the law within their respective demesnes.  Each of them could turn the whole force of the people against the injustice of anyone.
No other persons had sufficient authority to do this.</description>

                <description>CLEMENCY is the characteristic of monarchs. In republics, whose principle is virtue, it is not so necessary.
In despotic governments, where fear predominates, it is less customary, because the great men are to be restrained by examples of severity. It is more necessary in monarchies, where they are governed by honour, which frequently requires what the very law forbids. Disgrace is here equivalent to chastisement; and even the forms of justice are punishments.</description>

                <description>Philosophy first became known to the world via Socrates’ school from Plato and Aristotle. They consolidated the former systems, which were consistent with their own general principles to make their own systems.
They did not derive anything from the Ionian Philosophy.
 Plato and Aristotle derived the fundamental principles of almost all their doctrines from the Pythagorean school. Plato also borrowed something from the sects of Cratylus and Heraclitus, and Xenophanes, Parmenides, Melissus, and Zeno.</description>

This notion seems to have misled those early philosophers. But the things out of which all particular objects seem to be composed, are=

Anciently, there was little commerce between nations and ambassadors were only sent on particular occasions.
 They were what we now call &lsquo;ambassadors extraordinary&rsquo;. They returned home after their business was transacted. There were no resident ambassadors in Rome or Greece. Their duty was just to conclude peace, make alliances, etc.</description>

The rule of justice with respect to neutral nations is, that they should suffer no injury as they have offended no party.

The duties of one subject to another are sufficiently ascertained by the laws of every country and the courts of justice. But there are no judges to determine when sovereigns do wrong. [No world government yet] To suppose a sovereign subject to judgement, supposes another sovereign.
In England it can be exactly ascertained when the king encroaches on the people&rsquo;s privileges, or the people on the king&rsquo;s privileges.</description>

Those of Greece and Italy were composed chiefly of the proprietors of lands. They built their houses near each other with a wall for common defence.</description>

Dio says that the senate engaged the consuls to propose it, by reason that C. Cornelius, the tribune, had resolved to cause more severe punishments to be established against this crime; to which the people seemed greatly inclined.
The senate rightly judged, that immoderate punishments would strike indeed a terror into people’s minds, but must have also this effect, that there would be nobody afterwards to accuse or condemn; whereas, by proposing moderate penalties, there would be always judges and accusers.</description>

Hence they called both the decad and the tetrad as every number.
The decad was a number in energy, but the tetrad was a number in capacity.
The sum of these four numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 made up the tetractys, in which all harmonic ratios are included.</description>

 lack the knowledge of the true being of each thing have no clear pattern in their souls are unable as with a painter&rsquo;s eye to look at the absolute truth and repair to the original are unable to have a perfect vision of the other world, order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice, and guard and preserve their order.</description>

We must determine the nature and number of the appetites first. Everyone has unnecessary pleasures and appetites which I think are unlawful.
But in some persons, they are controlled by the laws and by reason. The better desires prevail over them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak. While in the case of others they are more and are stronger.</description>

The 14th Symbol is explaind by Iamblichus:
“This symbol exhorts us to the exercise of justice, to the honoring equality and moderation in an admirable degree, and to the knowledge of justice as the most perfect virtue, to which the other virtues give completion, and without which none of the rest are of any advantage.
It also admonishes us, that it is proper to know this virtue not in a careless manner, but through theorems and scientific demonstrations.</description>

                <description>Pantrynomics (Economic Superphysics) aims to solve all economic problems by adding moneyless donations and exchange (barter), as points-based valuation, to the current money-based valuation. This is similar to how Material Superphysics aims to solve mysteries in Physics by adding the aether-idea onto the idea of &ldquo;quantum fields&rdquo;.
The points-based valuation represents the effort theory of value which we derived from Adam Smith:
Labour..is the only universal, as well as the only accurate measure of value.</description>

                <description>It is not easy to determine how far a nation may push its resentment against another nation which has injured it.
The practice of ancient and modern nations differs extremely. In general, resentment is necessary and just when an injury:
 is clearly and distinctly done, or is plainly intended and satisfaction refused.  There are a few cases in which it is lawful even without satisfaction being demanded.
If a robber intended to kill you, it would be quite lawful for you to do all you could to prevent him.</description>

The lawsuit&rsquo;s foundation is the violation of some perfect right whose performance may be extorted by force.
In modern times, it is decided by the magistrate, lest the society should be disturbed by every person taking justice at his own hands.
The sovereign is bound to demand satisfaction for the following offences=

Two letters of Smith still remain=
 one to the Earl of Carlisle, First Lord of Trade and Plantations, and the other to Henry Dundas—which state his views on this subject.  The policy of commercial restriction was most cruelly used against the Irish between the Restoration (1660) and the Union (1707).</description>

  A person is wise if he can learn things that are difficult
  Sense-perception is common to all. So it is easy and is not a mark of Wisdom.
A man is wiser if he is more exact and more capable of teaching the causes in every branch of knowledge.</description>

                <description>Samuel Rogers was the author of the Pleasures of Memory. He went to Scotland to make its ‘home tour’. It was then much in vogue.
He brought with him letters of introduction to Smith from Dr. Price and Dr. Kippis. Dr. Kippis was the editor of the Biographia Britannica. Rogers, a poet, was then 23. He had only published his Ode to Superstition. His father’s old Unitarian friends were his only chief acquaintances in the world of letters.</description>

                <description>Smith had long contemplated revising the Theory of Moral Sentiments which had been around for 30 years with five editions.
But it never went through any revision. This was the task of the last year of his life. He made considerable changes, especially by addition. He wrote the additions while he was under severe illness.
It was his best writing in point of literary style. (Stewart)
Before the new edition appeared, there was a preliminary difference between author and publisher regarding the propriety of issuing the additions.</description>

                <description>With respect to the amity, however, which subsists in all things towards all, Pythagoras delivered it in the clearest manner.
And, the amity of the Gods indeed towards men, he unfolded through piety and scientific cultivation; but that of dogmas towards each other, and universally of the soul towards the body, and of the rational towards the species of the irrational part, through philosophy, and the theory pertaining to it. With respect to the amity of men also towards each other; that of citizens he delivered through sane legislation, but that of strangers through a correct physiology; and that between man and wife, or children, or brothers, 163 and kindred, through unperverted communion.</description>

In one of these we mean the substance, i.e. the essence (for the &lsquo;why&rsquo; is reducible finally to the definition, and the ultimate &lsquo;why&rsquo; is a cause and principle)
in another the matter or substratum, in a third the source of the change, and in a fourth the cause opposed to this, the purpose and the good (for this is the end of all generation and change).</description>

                <description>These communications with leading statesmen were showing the impression that the Wealth of Nations had made in this country. Smith was receiving equally satisfactory proofs of its recognition abroad. The book had been translated into Danish in two volumes by F. Dräbye in 1779-80. Apparently, he contemplated publishing a second edition. Through a Danish friend, he asked Smith what changes he proposed in his second edition. Smith then wrote Strahan the following letter, asking him to send a copy of the second edition to Dräbye= — Dear Sir—</description>

                <description>The new edition of the Theory was Smith’s last published work. A French newspaper, the Moniteur Universelle of Paris, announced on March 11, 1790 that Smith would do a critical examination of Montesquieu’s Esprit des Lois.
It speculated that the work would make an epoch in the history of politics and of philosophy.
But there is no evidence that he intended to publish a separate work on Montesquieu. Before March 1790, his strength seems to have been much wasted.</description>

In these principles, numbers are by nature the first.
In numbers they seemed to see many resemblances to the things that exist and come into being-more than in fire and earth and water (such and such a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul and reason, another being opportunity-and similarly almost all other things being numerically expressible);</description>

He became familiar with Cratylus in his youth and with the Heraclitean doctrines (that all sensible things are ever in a state of flux and there is no knowledge about them), these views he held even in later years.
Socrates was busying himself about ethical matters and neglecting the world of nature as a whole.</description>

But all evidently have some inkling of them, though only vaguely.
For some speak of the first principle as matter, whether they suppose one or more first principles, and whether they suppose this to be a body or to be incorporeal.
For example:

                <description>Dr. Richard Price had recently stirred a sensation by his attempt to prove that England’s population=
 was declining, and had actually declined nearly 30% since the Revolution.  The first to go against him was William Eden. Eden’s Fifth Letter to the Earl of Carlisle was published in 1780. It exposes the weakness of Price’s statistics. It argues that both England’s population and trade had increased. Price replied to these criticisms in the same year.</description>

                <description>Aristæus was the successor of Pythagoras.
He was the son of Damophon the Crotonian, who lived at the same time as Pythagoras, was seven ages prior to Plato.
Aristæus was eminently skilled in the Pythagoric dogmas. This made him:
 worthy to succeed Pythagoras in his school, educate his children, marry his wife Theano  Pythagoras himself taught in Aristaeus&rsquo; school. But Aristæus, when much advanced in 189 years, relinquished the school.</description>

                <description>Some philosophers say that the universe is one and posit one kind of thing as matter, and as corporeal matter which has spatial magnitude, evidently go astray in many ways.
They say that the elements of bodies only, not of incorporeal things, though there are also incorporeal things.
In trying to state the causes of generation and destruction, and in giving a physical account of all things, they do away with the cause of movement.</description>

                <description>54  Prudence is recommended to us by the concern for our own happiness.
Justice and beneficence are recommended to us by the concern for the happiness of others. Justice restrains us from hurting that happiness. Beneficence prompts us to promote it.
Prudence is originally recommended to us by our selfish affections. Justice and beneficence are recommended to us by our benevolent affections. These are recommended to us independent of any regard to:</description>

                <description>Which of two ways the nature of the universe contains the good, and the highest good?
Is it something separate and by itself, or as the order of the parts?
Probably in both ways, as an army does. For its good is found both in its order and in its leader, and more in the latter; for he does not depend on the order but it depends on him.
All things are ordered together somehow, but not all alike,-both fishes and fowls and plants; and the world is not such that one thing has nothing to do with another, but they are connected.</description>

                <description>What is the differentia of a number and of a unit if it has a differentia?
Units must differ either in quantity or in quality. Neither of these are possible.
But number qua number differs in quantity. If the units also did differ in quantity, number would differ from number, though equal in number of units.
Are the first units greater or smaller, and do the later ones increase or diminish?</description>

                <description>Are the units associable or inassociable?
If inassociable, in which of the two ways we distinguished. For it is possible that any unity is inassociable with any, and it is possible that those in the &lsquo;itself&rsquo; are inassociable with those in the &lsquo;itself&rsquo;, and, generally, that those in each ideal number are inassociable with those in other ideal numbers.
 All units are associable and without difference, we get mathematical number-only one kind of number, and the Ideas cannot be the numbers.</description>

                <description>There is a first principle. The causes of things are neither an infinite series nor infinitely various in kind.
For neither can one thing proceed from another, as from matter, ad infinitum (e.g. flesh from earth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on without stopping), nor can the sources of movement form an endless series (man for instance being acted on by air, air by the sun, the sun by Strife, and so on without limit).</description>

                <description>Is it the genera that should be taken as elements and principles, or rather the primary constituents of a thing?   e.g. it is the primary parts of which articulate sounds consist that are thought to be elements and principles of articulate sound, not the common genus-articulate sound; and we give the name of &rsquo;elements&rsquo; to those geometrical propositions, the proofs of which are implied in the proofs of the others, either of all or of most.</description>

                <description>Some philosophers assert that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be.
Writers on nature use this language.
But it is impossible for anything to be and not to be at the same time. The uneducated even demand that this be demonstrated. It is impossible for everything to be demonstrated as this would lead to an infinite regression that would end up with no demonstration.</description>

                <description>Besides perceptible things and the intermediates, we have to look for another class of things &ndash; the Forms which we posit.
If it is for this reason, because the objects of mathematics, while they differ from the things in this world in some other respect, differ not at all in that there are many of the same kind, so that their first principles cannot be limited in number (just as the elements of all the language in this sensible world are not limited in number, but in kind, unless one takes the elements of this individual syllable or of this individual articulate sound-whose elements will be limited even in number;</description>

                <description>Who is to be the judge of things? All such questions have the same meaning. These people demand that a reason shall be given for everything; for they seek a starting-point, and they seek to get this by demonstration, while it is obvious from their actions that they have no conviction. But their mistake is what we have stated it to be; they seek a reason for things for which no reason can be given; for the starting-point of demonstration is not demonstration.</description>

                <description>There is no contact in numbers, but succession. Between the units, there is nothing. Between those in 2 or in 3 one might ask whether these succeed the 1-itself or not, and whether, of the terms that succeed it, 2 or either of the units in 2 is prior.
Similar difficulties occur with regard to the classes of things posterior to number,-the line, the plane, and the solid. For some construct these out of the species of the &lsquo;great and small&rsquo;; e.</description>

                <description>From the same opinion proceeds the doctrine of Protagoras.
Both doctrines must be alike true or alike untrue. If all opinions and appearances are true, all statements must be at the same time true and false.
For many men hold beliefs in which they conflict with one another, and think those mistaken who have not the same opinions as themselves; so that the same thing must both be and not be.</description>

                <description>The hardest and most necessary inquiry for knowledge of the truth is whether being and unity are the substances of things.   Is each of them, without being anything else, is being or unity respectively?
What is the nature of being and unity?
Some people think they are of being. Others think they are of unity. Plato and the Pythagoreans thought being and unity were nothing else, but this was their nature, their essence being just unity and being.</description>

                <description>Should the sciences investigate all the kinds of causes?   How could it belong to one science to recognize the principles if these are not contrary?
There are many things to which not all the principles pertain. How can a principle of change or the nature of the good exist for unchangeable things, since everything that in itself and by its own nature is good is an end, and a cause in the sense that for its sake the other things both come to be and are, and since an end or purpose is the end of some action, and all actions imply change?</description>

                <description>Does our investigation deal with substances alone or also with their attributes?   If the solid is a substance and so are lines and planes, is it the business of the same science to know these and to know the attributes of each of these classes (the attributes about which the mathematical sciences offer proofs), or of a different science? If of the same, the science of substance also must be a demonstrative science, but it is thought that there is no demonstration of the essence of things.</description>

                <description>The one-sided theories which some people express about all things cannot be valid.
On the one hand the theory that nothing is true (for, say they, there is nothing to prevent every statement from being like the statement &rsquo;the diagonal of a square is commensurate with the side&rsquo;), on the other hand the theory that everything is true.
These views are the same as that of Heraclitus. for he who says that all things are true and all are false also makes each of these statements separately, so that since they are impossible, the double statement must be impossible too.</description>

                <description>What is Dialectical reasoning? Dialectical reasoning can be explained by understanding what is reasoning and its varieties.
Reasoning is an argument leads to other arguments when certain things are laid down.
  It is a &lsquo;demonstration&rsquo; when the premises from which the reasoning starts are true and primary  It is &lsquo;dialectical&rsquo; if it reasons from opinions that are generally accepted.
  Things are &rsquo;true&rsquo; and &lsquo;primary&rsquo; which are believed on the strength not of anything else but of themselves= for in regard to the first principles of science it is improper to ask any further for the why and wherefore of them;</description>

They introduced other Ideas equal in number to these phenomena. A man who wanted to count things will not be able to count if they were few. So he adds to them in order to count them. The Forms are practically equal to, or at least not fewer than the things that they represent.They say each thing has an entity which has the same name and exists apart from the substances [matter].</description>

If they are individual and not universal then:
 real things will be just of the same number as the elements, and the elements will not be knowable.</description>

 What is their definition of virtue? What is the conduct that makes up the praise-worthy character?   This character is the natural object of esteem, honour, and approbation. By what faculty in the mind recommends this character to us?</description>

                <description>Our problems are:
  Does the investigation of the causes belongs to one or to more sciences?
  whether such a science should survey only the first principles of substance, or also the principles on which all men base their proofs, e.g. whether it is possible at the same time to assert and deny one and the same thing or not, and all other such questions; and
  If the science in question deals with substance, whether one science deals with all substances, or more than one, and if more, whether all are akin, or some of them must be called forms of Wisdom and the others something else.</description>

                <description>How do the Forms contribute to sensible things, either eternal or non-eternal?
The Forms cause neither movement nor any change in those things. But again they help in no wise either towards the knowledge of other things (for they are not even the substance of these, else they would have been in them), or towards their being, if they are not in the individuals which share in them; though if they were, they might be thought to be causes, as white causes whiteness in a white object by entering into its composition.</description>

                <description>Update: April 2021  This post was made in 2015 because the model predicted a huge crisis starting in 2019 that could eventually collapse some societies.   The main advantage of Pantrynomics over Economics is that it is based on the dynamics of the human mind as explained by David Hume which was later applied by Adam Smith into his Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations.</description>

                <description>The core flaw of Economics, which is also the source of the unsustainability of &ldquo;economic&rdquo; systems, is that it focuses on utility or pleasure from external objects as their ultimate goals.
According to Adam Smith, this is wrong because utility is merely the effect of existence and is part of the deception of Nature (which in Eastern Philosophy is called Maya).
  It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind.</description>

                <description>People&rsquo;s confusion regarding Smith&rsquo;s works, such as his stand on capitalism, arises because he did not define nor explain self-interest, private ownership, and why a person should have the profits of one&rsquo;s own work.
It is but equity that those who feed, clothe and lodge the the people, should have such a share* of the produce of their own labour  Capitalism violates the concept of profit-sharing by giving all the profits* to the investor or owner.</description>

                <description>Society &lsquo;Society&rsquo; comes from the Latin socius which means companion which is an abstract term.
Nation &lsquo;Nation&rsquo; comes from the Latin natus which refers to birth. Thus, a nation can have two meaning:
 The place where a person was born &ndash; this leads to nationality The ethnicity of the person at birth &ndash; this leads to &lsquo;Cherokee nation&rsquo; if one&rsquo;s parents are both Cherokee  State A state is a formalized society that is non-arbitrary.</description>

                <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/capitalism/</guid>
                <description>Summary: We define Capitalism as an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits.
 A major topic of debate among economists is whether Adam Smith was a proponent of capitalism.
We argue that he was not, simply because his core ideas are very different from those of capitalism, which is merely mercantilism with superficial changes. The source of the confusion is the unclear definition of the word &lsquo;capitalism&rsquo;.</description>

                <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/fallacies/profit-maximization-is-absurd/</guid>
                <description>A key fallacy that is inseparably part of Economics, along with equilibrium, is the idea of profit maximization.
The idea of maximization has its origins in Newton&rsquo;s Calculus which in turn has its origins in Physics. Smith and Hume never mentioned maximization nor calculus anywhere in their writings on the political economy. In fact, The Wealth of Nations has no equations at all*!
 *Instead of equality, equilibrium, equations, or 1 + 1 = 2, Smith makes extensive use of ratios, proportions, balance, or 2 : 2, as prices are psychological and not physical in nature.</description>

                <description>To prove the sophistry of capitalism, we must trace the roots of its core ideas. Among its core ideas is the production motive, or the sophistical belief that what is good for the producers or sellers, or those who live by profits, is good for the nation.
This is in contrast to the consumption motive espoused by Adam Smith.
The production motive is best seen in Say&rsquo;s Law which says that production is the cause of demand.</description>

                <description>The Economist showed an interesting graphic of the correlation of skyscrapers and economic crises in a phenomenon known as the Skyscraper Curse. A question was posed: &ldquo;Does this frenzy of building augur badly for the world economy?&rdquo;, to which we answer &ldquo;Yes, because of Economics&rdquo;.
To explain why skyscraper booms are generally bad, we explain their nature using our Dialectical method, or by finding out the metaphysical causes to physical economic effects, as used by David Hume and Adam Smith.</description>

                <description>We can use our DCTI tool to analyze the Greek crisis to prove that the current solutions of austerity and high taxes are not the best ones. Such solutions are are a relic of the mercantile way of thinking of an economy as a business, instead of, naturally, as a society, family, or group of friends. The proper solution will involve the whole EU and will help the union stay together*.</description>

                <description>14  Land is a fund more naturally stable and permanent.
The rent of public lands was the main source of the public revenue of many great nations above the shepherd state. The ancient Greek and Italian republics derived most of the government revenue from the rent of public lands. The ancient European sovereigns for a long time derived their revenue from the rent of the crown lands.

                <description>23  Book 1 has shown that private revenue comes from rent, profit, and wages.
Every tax must ultimately be paid from any or all of those three kinds of revenue.
Part 2 is about the taxes imposed on rent, profit, wages, and on all those three revenues. These three taxes have subdivisions. Many of those taxes are not ultimately paid by the source of revenue it is charged to.</description>

                <description>30  A tax on land rent may be based on a valuation which is fixed and does not change with the actual rent which can fluctuate with the land&rsquo;s improvement or decline.
 31  A land-tax assessed according to an invariable rule becomes unequal after some time according to the lands&rsquo; improvement. The tax becomes unequal even if it were equal at the start.
An example is Great Britain&rsquo;s land tax where the valuation of each district to the land-tax in 1692 was very unequal at the start.</description>

Some additional costs would be incurred by=
 the register offices which would be established in the different districts of the countryside, the different valuations of the lands which the proprietor chose to occupy himself.  All this cost might be below the cost incurred by many other taxes which bring a smaller revenue.</description>

                <description>57  Taxes on the produce of land are really taxes on rent.
They are finally paid by the landlord even if they are originally paid by the farmer. When a part of the produce is paid as tax, the farmer computes the yearly value of that part.
 He makes a proportional abatement in the rent to pay to the landlord. All farmers compute beforehand what the yearly church tithe will amount to.</description>

                <description>74  Ground-rents are a better tax subject than house-rents.
A tax on ground-rents would not raise house-rents.
It would all fall on the owner of the ground-rent.
 He always acts as a monopolist. He exacts the highest rent for the use of his ground.  Its value varies with the wealth or poverty of his competitors. The most rich competitors are in the capital. Thus, highest ground-rents are always found there.</description>

 Capitation taxes Taxes on consumable commodities  These must be paid indifferently from rent, wages, or profits.
Capitation Taxes  139  Capitation taxes* become arbitrary if it is proportioned to the fortune or revenue of each taxpayer.
A man&rsquo;s fortune varies daily. Without an intolerable annual inquisition, it can only be guessed at.</description>

                <description>157  The impossibility of taxing people according to their revenue by any capitation led to the invention of taxes on consumable commodities.
The state, not knowing how to directly and proportionally tax the revenue of its subjects, taxes it indirectly by taxing their expence.
Their expence is supposed to be proportional to their revenue. It is taxed by taxing the consumable commodities that they buy.
 148  Necessities are commodities needed to support life.</description>

                <description>155  In Great Britain, the principal taxes on necessities are those on salt, leather, soap, and candles.
 156  Salt is a very ancient and a very universal subject of taxation. It was taxed among the Romans and is presently taxed in Europe. Nobody could sensibly feel even a heavy tax on salt because it was consumed so little and could be bought gradually.
In England, it is taxed at 40 pence a bushel or three times its original price.</description>

                <description>The History of Customs Duties  165  Customs duties are much more ancient than excise duties.
They were called &lsquo;customs&rsquo; to denote customary payments which used from time immemorial. They were originally taxes on merchants&rsquo; profits.
During the times of feudal anarchy, merchants were=
 a little better than emancipated bondmen, despised like all other burgh inhabitants.  Merchants&rsquo; gains were envied. The nobility consented that the king should tallage the profits of=</description>

                <description>170  I showed in Book 4 that the mercantile system was not very favourable to the people&rsquo;s revenue or the national annual produce.
It is not more favourable to the sovereign&rsquo;s revenue, at least as that revenue depends on duties.
 171  Because of the mercantile system, the importation of several goods was banned.
It reduced the importers to smuggling. It entirely prevented the importation of foreign woollens.</description>

                <description>178  High taxes frequently afford a smaller revenue to government than moderate taxes=
 by reducing the consumption of taxed commodities, and by encouraging smuggling.   179  When the reduction of revenue is caused by the reduction of consumption, the only remedy is to lower the tax.
 180  When the reduction of the revenue is caused by smuggling, it may be remedied=
 by reducing the temptation to smuggle, and This temptation can only be reduced by lowering the tax.</description>

                <description>190  In Great Britain, liquors for private use are not liable to any excise duties.
This exemption aims to save private families from the tax-gatherer&rsquo;s odious visit. It causes those duties to fall much lighter on the rich than the poor.
Distilling for private use is not very common.
 But in the countryside, many middle class and almost all rich families brew their own beer.  Their strong beer costs them 96 pence a barrel less than it costs the common brewer.</description>

An example is the French Peages. These were=

They were originally local and provincial duties applicable to local and provincial purposes.</description>

Some provinces are allowed to compound for the gabelle or salt-tax. Others are exempted from it altogether. Some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale of tobacco The farmers-general enjoy this exemption through most of France.</description>

1. Lack of Double Coincidence of Wants Persons must have matching requirements for barter to work
Our Response
This is only true for bilateral barter or trade involving two persons. Smith&rsquo;s system is multilateral wherein trade is circular and not direct.
The following workmen are necessary to make the shears used to clip the wool to make the coat: The miner, builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, The feller of the timber, The burner of the charcoal used in the smelting-house, The brick-maker and the brick-layer, The workers who attend the furnace The mill-wright, forger, and smith.</description>

                <description>Adam Smith would be against Brexit because the European Union (EU) is an internal free trade zone and Britain derives a lot of benefits from it.
However, this does not mean that Smith would be pro-EU. This is because while there is free trade within it, there are oppressive regulations and subsidies that make it hard for outsiders and outside trade to penetrate fortress Europe.
Rather, Smith would be for a World Union (WU) where all countries have free trade and immigration with each other.</description>

                <description>Adam Smith gave 4 maxims on taxation in The Wealth of Nations that have been largely forgotten today. Taxes should be fair, non-arbitrary, cost-effective and convenient.
Maxim 1 People should contribute towards supporting their government in proportion to their respective abilities
The rich or those who have the ability topay more should pay more than those who are less able to. Smith&rsquo;s pro-poor taxation policies are found in Book 5, Chapter 2, and are as clear as day:</description>

                <description>Adam Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations as an attack on Mercantilism which has since evolved into Neoclassical Economics. Despite his attack, it&rsquo;s very strange for him to entrust an entire country&rsquo;s external trade to foreign merchants:
If the society has insufficient capital to cultivate all its lands and to completely process all its rude produce, there is even a big advantage that its rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital.</description>

Gymnastic exercises were intended to:
 harden his body, sharpen his courage, and prepare him for war.  The Greek militia was one of the best in the world. Their public education completely answered its purpose.</description>

                <description>13  In Great Britain, the land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated every year by a borrowing clause.
This clause is constantly inserted into the acts which impose those taxes.
The Bank of England advances to government the total amount of those taxes at 3-8% interest.
 It receives payment as the taxes come in. Any deficiency is offset by the tax proceeds of the next year.  The only remaining unmortgaged public revenue is thus spent before it comes in.</description>

 the clergy, and the people of the episcopal city.  The people did not long retain their right of election.
When they had it, they almost always acted under the clergy&rsquo;s influence. The clergy soon grew weary of managing them. They found it easier to elect their own bishops themselves in the same way as the abbot was elected by the monks of the monastery.</description>

This mediocrity of benefice may be carried too far but has very agreeable effects. Only the most exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune. Levity and vanity render him ridiculous.
They are as ruinous to him as they are to common people. He must follow the moral system respected by the common people.</description>

                <description>3 Requirements for a Wealthy Country According to Adam Smith, there are three basic factors needed to be a major economic power:
 The people must have a good moral system The people must not be stupid The country must have access to the ocean  A fourth optional factor would be having natural resources.
Economic power is in the value that a society creates. This produced value is transmitted through exchange which is facilitated by morals.</description>

                <description>Import substitution is an economic policy that replaces imports with local manufactures. It was popularized by Argentina in the 1970&rsquo;s and subsequently spread around the world. Its main goal is to lower a country’s expenses.
Adam Smith would categorize it as a policy by poor and austere societies:
In every civilized society which has the distinction of ranks, there were always two systems of morality: the strict or austere which is generally admired and revered by the common people, and the liberal or loose system which is commonly adopted by people of fashion.</description>

 a more equal land-tax, a more equal tax on house rents, and changes in the current customs and excise system, as those mentioned in (Chapter 2n)  It would distribute the burden more equally on all. This increase would not totally liberate the public revenue.

                <description>Adam Smith gave three kinds of trades:
1. Local or Home Trade This is the trade done within a nation&rsquo;s borders. This generally supports the most people. Ancient and Medieval China was able to sustain itself with local trade alone.
2. Direct Foreign Trade 3. Indirect or Roundabout Foreign Trade Of course, no country can do everything by itself, that’s why Smith wrote:
The most round-about foreign trade of consumption therefore may be as necessary as the most direct foreign trade in terms of supporting the productive labour of the country and the value of its produce.</description>

                <description>The science of resource allocation began with Xenophon&rsquo;s The Economist which narrates how Socrates was taught about proper estate management.
Socrates cites Cyrus the Great of Persia as the first person during that period to get Economics right by having policies that encouraged the productivity of the empire.
In the West, this knowledge was carried over from the Persians to the Greeks and then to the Romans.
Asia, on the other hand, had its Economics founded in Hinduism which predates the Persian empire.</description>

                <description>214  The gradual improvements of arts, manufactures, and commerce which destroyed the power of the great barons destroyed the whole temporal power of the clergy in Europe.
Like the great barons, the clergy found something in the manufactures and commerce which they could exchange their rude produce.
 They discovered ways of spending their whole revenues on their own persons without sharing with other people.  Their charity became gradually less extensive.</description>

 the different periods of improvement the different forms of government   233  In an opulent society, all the orders of people are everyday growing more expensive in their houses, furniture, dress, etc.

                <description>Adam Smith said that the differences in wages are due to five factors (agreeableness, trust, constancy, risk, cost of learning) and 3 states (backward, stationary, advancing).
In contrast, David Ricardo simplistically said that wages are based on the supply and demand of workers and the cost of goods and services which wages are spent on . Because of this simplicity, Ricardo concluded that wages must fall ( Iron Law of Wages ).</description>

                <description>The DCTI tool can diagnose the economic health of societies according the maxims of Adam Smith.
A society, whether it be a family, corporation, or country, is wealthy if its productivity or value produced exceeds its own demand or value needed. This productivity is shown in the “Industry” column below, while the demand is shown in the “Demand” column. A society is wealthy if its Industry bars are higher than its Demand bars and poor if it is lower.</description>

                <description>Our previous post on The Four Laws of Value explained the metaphysics of value and why Pantrynomic&rsquo;s goal is zero inflation.
Economics shallowly defines &lsquo;inflation&rsquo; as a rise in prices, and &lsquo;deflation&rsquo; as its decline. This definition obviously does not hold because Japan has been in deflation for a long time and yet its prices, such as rent and consumer prices, remain high.
What really &lsquo;deflated&rsquo; was economic activity, arising from Japan&rsquo;s declining population.</description>

                <description>XXV. In the fourth rank of prerogative instances we will class clandestine instances, which we are also wont to[166] call twilight instances; they are as it were opposed to the conspicuous instances, for they show the required nature in its lowest state of efficacy, and as it were its cradle and first rudiments, making an effort and a sort of first attempt, but concealed and subdued by a contrary nature. Such instances are, however, of great importance in discovering forms, for as the conspicuous tend easily to differences, so do the clandestine best lead to genera, that is, to those common natures of which the required natures are only the limits.</description>

For the motions and effects of bodies are compounded, decomposed, and combined, no less than the bodies themselves.</description>

                <description>But there still remains one method of avoiding this conclusion, and one source which we have not yet examined. When any natural object or event is presented, it is impossible for us, by any sagacity or penetration, to discover, or even conjecture, without experience, what event will result from it, or to carry our foresight beyond that object which is immediately present to the memory and senses.  Even after one instance or experiment where we have observed a particular event to follow upon another, we are not entitled to form a general rule, or foretell what will happen in like cases; it being justly esteemed an unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment, however accurate or certain.</description>

This is done with a die of iron, upon which pictures or words are engraved in reverse. The stamp is pressed upon the dinar or the dirham, and the designs (legends) of those engravings appear on the coin clearly and correctly. Before this is done, the standard of purity of the particular coin, the result of repeated refinings, is taken into consideration, and the individual dinars and dirhams are given the proper, fixed weight that has been agreed upon.</description>

Now will I open unto thee&ndash;whose heart Rejects not&ndash;that last lore, deepest-concealed, That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths, Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,&ndash; A royal lore! a Kingly mystery! Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it From every sin; a light of holiness With inmost splendour shining; plain to see; Easy to walk by, inexhaustible! They that receive not this, failing in faith To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me, Destroyer of thy foes!</description>

Whatever Natures be To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me!</description>

Arjuna. This, for my soul&rsquo;s peace, have I heard from Thee, The unfolding of the Mystery Supreme Named Adhyatman; comprehending which, My darkness is dispelled; for now I know&ndash; O Lotus-eyed![FN#21]&ndash;whence is the birth of men, And whence their death, and what the majesties Of Thine immortal rule. Fain would I see, As thou Thyself declar&rsquo;st it, Sovereign Lord! The likeness of that glory of Thy Form Wholly revealed.</description>

Whoever serve Me&ndash;as I show Myself&ndash; Constantly true, in full devotion fixed, Those hold I very holy. But who serve&ndash; Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible, The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable, Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure&ndash; Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense, Of one set mind to all, glad in all good, These blessed souls come unto Me.</description>

Arjuna. Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava![FN#26] Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees, And what it is we know-or think to know. Krishna. Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports; And that which views and knows it is the Soul, Kshetrajna. In all &ldquo;fields,&rdquo; thou Indian prince! I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys! Only that knowledge knows which knows the known By the knower!</description>

Krishna. Men call the Aswattha,&ndash;the Banyan-tree,&ndash; Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,&ndash; The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth! Who knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all. Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,[FN#30] Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms, And all the eager verdure of its girth, Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air, As men&rsquo;s lives quicken to the temptings fair Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek The soil beneath, helping to hold it there, As actions wrought amid this world of men Bind them by ever-tightening bonds again.</description>

Krishna. Fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will Always to strive for wisdom; opened hand And governed appetites; and piety, And love of lonely study; humbleness, Uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives, Truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind That lightly letteth go what others prize; And equanimity, and charity Which spieth no man&rsquo;s faults; and tenderness Towards all that suffer; a contented heart, Fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild, Modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed, With patience, fortitude, and purity; An unrevengeful spirit, never given To rate itself too high;&ndash;such be the signs, O Indian Prince!</description>

Arjuna.
If men forsake the holy ordinance, Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart And worship, what shall be the state of those, Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say! Krishna. Threefold the faith is of mankind and springs From those three qualities,&ndash;becoming &ldquo;true,&rdquo; Or &ldquo;passion-stained,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dark,&rdquo; as thou shalt hear! The faith of each believer, Indian Prince! Conforms itself to what he truly is. Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one To what he worships lives assimilate, [Such as the shrine, so is the votary,] The &ldquo;soothfast&rdquo; souls adore true gods; the souls Obeying Rajas worship Rakshasas[FN#34] Or Yakshas; and the men of Darkness pray To Pretas and to Bhutas.</description>

Arjuna. Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One! The very truth&ndash;Heart&rsquo;s Lord!&ndash;of Sannyas, Abstention; and enunciation, Lord! Tyaga; and what separates these twain! Krishna. The poets rightly teach that Sannyas Is the foregoing of all acts which spring Out of desire; and their wisest say Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. There be among the saints some who have held All action sinful, and to be renounced; And some who answer, &ldquo;Nay!</description>

Manifesto of the Communist Party A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power?</description>

Chapter II. Proletarians and Communists In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?
The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.
They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.
They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.</description>

Chapter III. Socialist and Communist Literature
 Reactionary Socialism A. Feudal Socialism Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation[A], these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart.</description>

Chapter IV. Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian Reformers in America.
The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement.</description>

That which keeps something alive is said to be its vrtti [occupation]. The physical pabula on which the mind depends for its existence and development, or the objects on which the mind ideates, are one’s mental occupation. The subtlest feeling a person can experience, which fills the mind with bliss, can be said to be one’s spiritual occupation. In the same way there are various physical occupations which preserve one’s physical existence and maintain the body.</description>

                <description>The maximisation of economic benefits from world trade can be facilitated, but not automatically assured, by any purely technical system, whether bilaterl or multilateral.
How would Pool Clearing increase such benefits? Negative Balances Pool Clearing allows every country to discharge all its cash obligations to the rest of the world simply by paying its own national currency into its National Clearing Fund.
 Every Clearing Fund would can then receive any payment from international economic exchange such as:  payments for foreign goods and services*, interest, dividend and amortisation payments on old and new foreign debts, etc.</description>

                <description>Assume, then, that appropriate limits have been fixed for the deficit any one country will be allowed to incur, and the system is put into operation.
It will work smoothly as long as every nation avoids exceeding the deficit limits. In this respect it would be analogous to a Gold Standard system. It works satisfactorily as long as deficit countries balance their foreign exchange income and expenditure in such a way that their gold reserve remains intact</description>

                <description>Book 1 laid down the principles of mathematical philosophy. This will be the basis of our reasonings on philosophical inquiries.
These mathematical principles are the laws and conditions of certain motions and forces. I use them to build a system of the universe.
To prevent them from being dry and barren, I have illustrated them here with some philosophical scholiums, such as:
 the density and the resistance of bodies spaces void of all bodies and the motion of light and sounds.</description>

                <description>Section 20 showed that General Relativity (GR) lets us derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical way*.
 *Superphysics Note= Yes, it&rsquo;s only theoretical just as Genesis is theoretical and not real!
 Let us suppose that we know the space-time “course” for any path in Galileian space relative to a non-moving viewpont. Through theoretical calculation, we can find how this path appears, as seen from a moving viewpoint K' which is moving relatively to K.</description>

                <description>It Began with the Financial Crisis Superphysics arose from Juan&rsquo;s personal research on the 2008 Financial Crisis which led to the 2008 Food Crisis, 2011 Arab Spring, and the Eurozone crisis.
The 2008 Financial Crisis arose from Allan Greenspan not doing his job of regulating the banking industry, citing Adam Smith who advocated non-regulation. So Adam Smith should be such an evil guy for causing so much trouble, right?
By going through Adam Smith&rsquo;s works, we saw that he actually advocated the strict regulation of banking, comparing it to the building of firewalls to prevent the spread of fire.</description>

                <description>At the beginning, the dynasty is remote from royal aspirations.
It needs group feeling through which its power and domination can materialize, and the desert attitude is characteristic of group feeling.
A dynasty based upon religion is remote from royal aspirations. In one based exclusively upon superior (political) power, the desert attitude, through which superiority is achieved, likewise is remote from royal aspirations and ways. Now, if a dynasty at the beginning of its rule is a Bedouin one, the ruler possesses austerity and the desert attitude.</description>

                <description>There are principles and causes which are generable and destructible without ever being in course of being generated or destroyed.
For otherwise all things will be of necessity, since that which is being generated or destroyed must have a cause which is not accidentally its cause. Will A exist or not? It will if B happens; and if not, not. And B will exist if C happens.
And thus if time is constantly subtracted from a limited extent of time, one will obviously come to the present.</description>

                <description>Actuality is prior to potentiality.
Potentiality is that definite kind which is a principle of change in another thing or in the thing itself regarded as other. It is every principle of movement or rest.
Nature also is in the same genus as potency. It is a principle of movement-not, however, in something else but in the thing itself qua itself. To all such potency, then, actuality is prior both in formula and in substantiality; and in time it is prior in one sense, and in another not.</description>

How quickly, or with what velocity W, does the man advance relative to the embankment?
If the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the train&rsquo;s velocity.</description>

                <description>UP to this time, there has not been discovered any way of positively telling from the hand the present age of a subject.
There is no marking in the hand or on the lines which will, independent of everything else, indicate this. But by close observation of the general appearance, color, and skin, you can approximate the correct age within a few years.
Youthful skin is fresh looking, elastic, generally well colored, and has the appearance of vitality.</description>

                <description>41 AMBERGRIS In the Arabian Sea, there are many dragons. When a dragon sleeps, his spittle floats on the water, collects and hardens.
The fishermen gather it as a most valuable substance. Fresh ambergris is white. It turns red when slightly stale, and black when it is old.
It is not fragrant nor bad-smelling. It is like pumice-stone but lighter.
The statement that a special derived from ambergris, and the other statement to the is as a most odour of ambergris can bring out eflFect that other scents, are both erroneous.</description>

                <description>There are five ways of attacking with fire.
 Burn soldiers in their camp Burn stores Burn baggage trains Burn arsenals and magazines Hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy  The material for raising fire should always be kept ready.
There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration.
 The proper season is when the weather is very dry The special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.</description>

                <description>In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy&rsquo;s country whole and intact.
 Shattering and destroying it is not so good. It is better to recapture an army, a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy it.  Supreme excellence is in breaking the enemy&rsquo;s resistance without fighting. It is not in fighting and conquering in all your battles.</description>

                <description>4. Bedouins are closer to being good than sedentary people The 16 reason for it is that the soul in its first natural state of creation is ready to accept whatever good or evil may arrive and leave an imprint upon it.
Muhammad said= &ldquo;Every infant is born in the natural state. It is his parents who make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.&rdquo; 17
To the degree the soul is first affected by one of the two qualities, it moves away from the other and finds it difficult to acquire it.</description>

                <description>I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical interpretation of space- and time-data in General Relativity (GR) because it would be very complicated to explain.
Assuming a space-time domain with no gravitational field relative to a reference-body K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen.
 K is then a Galileian reference-body as regards the domain considered The results of Special Relativity (SR) hold relative to K  The same domain referred to a 2nd body of reference K', which is rotating uniformly with respect to K.</description>

                <description>The terms &lsquo;being&rsquo; and &rsquo;non-being&rsquo; are used in three ways:
 With reference to the categories With reference to the potency or actuality of these or their non-potency or nonactuality In the sense of true and false.  This depends, on the side of the objects, on their being combined or separated, so that he who thinks the separated to be separated and the combined to be combined has the truth, while he whose thought is in a state contrary to that of the objects is in error.</description>

                <description>The whole whole chain of truths which I discovered would have gotten me into trouble.
I have ever remained firm in my original resolution to suppose no other principle than that of which I have recently availed myself in demonstrating the existence of God and of the soul, and to accept as true nothing that did not appear to me more clear and certain than the demonstrations of the geometers had formerly appeared;</description>

                <description>Bodies that revolve always tend to move away from the centers they revolve from. But what direction do the stars and heavens tend towards?
A body that tends towards some direction does not mean that there is a thought or desire inside the body that carries it there. Instead, it is disposed to move there and that there is something . preventing it. &ldquo;Tend&rdquo; here means that the body is doing an effort to counteract such a resistance.</description>

                <description>Symptoms At the initial stage the patient hears a buzzing sound in the ears, and gradually all other sounds become indistinct to him.
Causes Deafness is not a disease by itself, unless it is congenital. It is an after-effect or reaction to some other ailment. Therefore one may find innumerable reasons behind deafness.
 Excessive use of quinine or similar poisonous medicines for a long time reduces the power of hearing.</description>

The name is French. It is originally derived from the Greek πολιτεία, which properly signified the policy of civil government. But now it only means the regulation of the inferior parts of government=
 cleanliness This deals with the proper method of carrying dirt from the streets. security This deals with the execution of justice, so far as it regards regulations for preventing crimes or the method of keeping a city guarded.</description>

                <description>A dynasty may find itself in financial trouble because of its luxury and high expenditures and the insufficiency of the tax revenue to pay them.
So it imposes customs duties on the commercial activities of its subjects. Sometimes, it tortures its officials and tax collectors and sucks their bones dry (of a part of their fortune). (This happens) when officials and tax collectors are observed to have appropriated a good deal of tax money, which their accounts do not show.</description>

                <description>Corollary 1 A body that is moved by two perpendicular forces will move in a diagonal   A force M impressed on a body at A will be uniformly carried from A to B. A force N impressed at A will be carried from A to C. If N and M act together, their forces will an the same time be carried in the diagonal from A to D.  Law 2 means that N will not at all change the velocity generated by M  The body therefore will arrive at the line BD in the same time, whether the force N be impressed or not.</description>

                <description>Einstein (Universe has no center) vs Newton (Universe has a center) The astronomer Seeliger explained a problem in classical celestial mechanics aside from the problem explained in Section 21.
How should we see the universe as a whole?
Regarding space and time, the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere. So the density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless the same on the average everywhere.
Everywhere there is an attenuated swarm of stars of approximately the same kind and density.</description>

                <description>IN examining lines, note first the character of the lines themselves.
By this I mean their clearness, depth, evenness, and whether they are perfect or defective. If the latter is the case, what is the defect, does it cover the entire line or only a part of it, is the line repaired after the defect, does it regain its original depth and clearness, or does it show diminishing strength until it gradually fades away?</description>

                <description>I now explain the results from God&rsquo;s essence, which are able to lead us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind and its highest blessedness.
Definitions   Body is a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is considered as an extended thing. (See Pt. 1, Prop. 25, Coroll.)
  A thing&rsquo;s essence is that which inseparable from the thing.</description>

                <description>Defintions of the emotions 1. Desire is the actual essence of man, in so far as it is conceived, as determined to a particular activity by some given modification of itself.  Pleasure is the transition of a man from a less to a greater perfection.
  Pain is the transition of a man from a greater to a less perfection.
  Wonder is the conception of anything, wherein the mind comes to a stand, because the particular concept in question has no connection with other concepts (cf.</description>

In chronic cases it is natural for there to be no pain); occasional fever, and aggravation of the swelling during the fever, are the symptoms of this disease.
Causes  The liver and the spleen become weak due to chronic fever, and as a result, the immune defenses of the blood and lymph become diminished.</description>

                <description>THE surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me.
I can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a “neighbouring” one. I then repeat this process many times by going from point to point without executing “jumps.”
We express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum.
Many tiny rods have been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab.</description>

This now cannot be maintained because it required rigid reference-bodies as followed in Special Relativity (SR).
In Section 27, we replaced it with Gauss co-ordinates. This creates a new statement for General Relativity (GR)=
According to SR, the equations for the general laws of nature pass over into equations of the same form when we replace the space-time variables x, y, z, t, of a Galileian reference-body K by the space-time variables x', y', z', t', of a new reference-body K' using the Lorentz transformation.</description>

                <description>Is special relativity supported by experience?
This question is not easily answered as explained by Fizeau&rsquo;s experiment.
Special Relativity came from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus, everything that supports the electromagnetic theory also supports Special Relativity.
Special Relativity Proven By Starlight Special Relativity can predict the effects from the light from the fixed stars because the Earth moves relatively to those stars.
One effect is=
 the apparent position of those stars resulting from the Earth&rsquo;s motion around the sun (aberration), and the influence of the radial components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of their starlight  This manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light from a fixed star, compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle).</description>

Towns have a group of people who strive to make a living out of predicting the future because they know that the people are most eager to know it.</description>

Between u = 1 and u = 2 are an infinitely large number of curves corresponding to real numbers between 1 and 2. These u-curves must not intersect each other.Thus, a definite value of u belongs to every point on the surface of the marble slab.</description>

                <description>Superphysics Note= Einstein invents General Relativity by creating the idea of inertial mass which is really Newton&rsquo;s third law. This is why he has to say that everything is moving &ndash; because his inertial gravity is not really gravity, but just action and reaction.
 Assume that, in outerspace, there is a huge glass box that serves as our reference-body. That box has a man inside it. He floats because there is no gravity.</description>

The camels are the cause of the Arabs&rsquo; savage life in the desert, since they feed on the shrubs of the desert and give birth in the desert sands.</description>

“Inguinal hernia” is the dislodged intestine coming out through an opening left in the canal to the scrotum.
“Femoral hernia” happens if it pushes out through the hole in the canal of nerve fibres and the muscular network controlling the legs.</description>

 The provincial governors in the old dynasty to gain control over remote regions when (the dynasty) loses its influence there.  Each one of them founds a new dynasty for his people and a realm to be perpetuated in his family. His children or clients inherit it from him.</description>

                <description>A small republic is destroyed by a foreign force.
A large one is ruined by an internal imperfection.
Democracies and aristocracies are equally liable to these.
This is why mankind has been obliged to live constantly under the government of a single person until they developed a confederate republic. Such a constitution has:
 all the internal advantages of a republican government the external force of a monarchical government  A confederate republic is a convention by which petty states agree to become members of a larger one, which they intend to establish.</description>

Despotic governments do it by separating, and by keeping themselves single. They sacrifice a part of the country; and, by rav aging and desolating the frontiers, they render the heart of the empire inaccessible. This practice is more tolerable in large than in middling states.
A despotic government does all the mischief to itself that could be committed by a strong, cruel enemy.</description>

 Everything in the world is purchased by labour. The only cause of our labour are our passions. When a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land and the farmers study agriculture as a science. They redouble their industry and attention.
The superfluity from their labour is exchanged with manufactures now coveted by men’s luxury.</description>

                <description>The line of Intuition lies at the side of the hand near the percussion.
It rises on the Mount of Moon, and after describing a curve toward the Plain of Mars, ends on or near the Mount of Mercury.
It occupies the same position as the line of Mercury, but is distinguished from it by its curved formation, though I consider it practically a Mercury line. The presence of this line, if well marked, adds greatly to the intuitive faculty of a subject, though this may be only another name for Mercurian shrewdness.</description>

                <description>THE line of Mars rises on the lower Mount of Mars and runs inside of the Life line and very close beside it.
The two are sister lines, in fact, and in order to be in full strength the former must run so near to the Life line that it is manifestly related only to it and is not one of the lines of Influence on the Mount of Venus. This line was called the line of Mars because it rises upon one of the Martian Mounts, and its effect is to strengthen its sister line and to indicate a stronger constitution than is shown by even a deep Life line.</description>

                <description>No two hands are exactly alike because no two people are exactly alike in character, temperament, or in any other way.
Thousands of experiments have proven that in whatever way these persons differ, a corresponding change is found in the hand.
The nearer people are like each other, the nearer alike are the lines in their hands.
The hands of children are often similar with those of their parents. Even though you do not at first accept this hypothesis as being true, nevertheless give it a trial, and apply it faithfully and carefully to your line reading.</description>

                <description>In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign.
Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
 After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
  Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of deviation.</description>

                <description>A name sometimes means the composite substance, or the actuality or form.
e.g. whether &lsquo;house&rsquo; is a sign for the composite thing, &lsquo;a covering consisting of bricks and stones laid thus and thus&rsquo;, or for the actuality or form, &lsquo;a covering&rsquo;, and whether a line is &rsquo;twoness in length&rsquo; or &rsquo;twoness&rsquo;, and whether an animal is soul in a body&rsquo; or &lsquo;a soul&rsquo;;
for soul is the substance or actuality of some body.</description>

 the line of Health the line of Liver the Hepatica  It should start on the Mount of Moon and run upward on the percussion to the Mount of Mercury, from which it takes its name (478).
This line is valuable as an indicator of the state of the digestive apparatus, the operation of the liver, and it also shows the presence of various maladies and conditions which may arise from the impairment of these most important functions.</description>

                <description>Good sense is the most equally distributed among men. Everyone thinks himself having it. Those who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of good sense than they already possess.
Their conviction shows that:
 the power of judging is by nature equal in all men the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects.</description>

                <description>Symptoms  Indigestion and constipation Aversion to food Nausea after meals Pain in the stomach immediately or 1-2 hours after eating  Causes Partially-digested food or its juice passes from the stomach into the duodenum or upper intestine for further assimilation. There the digestive fluids with the help of bile from the liver and digestive juices from the pancreas accomplish the task of digestion.
But if, owing to defective working of these organs, the food is not completely digested here either, then it becomes spoiled and vitiated.</description>

                <description>Symptoms Fat is important to the human body. Without fat, the natural activity of the bones and muscles could not be sustained for a single moment.
But when this very fat abnormally accumulates beyond the ordinary requirement of the body, it causes all the organs of the body to become incapacitated. This state is called obesity.
Causes  Lack of physical labour while eating lots of curd (yogurt), milk, butter and other high-calorie foods Eating large quantities of sweets and large quantities of mucus-producing foods (fish, tamarind, etc.</description>

                <description>The brain is the apparent controller of the body and its organs. With the help of afferent and efferent nerves, the brain receives impulses from and transmits them to all parts of the body.
The brain is divided into the right and left, with the right side of the brain controlling the left portion of the body and the left side of the brain controlling the right.
If due to high blood pressure or some other cause any portion of the brain’s nervous system becomes damaged, the part of the body controlled by that portion of the nervous system also becomes inoperative.</description>

There are various causes of this disease –
 When the seminal receptacle is already full, a passionate thought will bring a seminal discharge in no time. This is called mental impotency. Excessive accumulation of poisonous acid or pitta in the body can also effect a quick seminal discharge.</description>

                <description>Symptoms Difficulty in urinating, passing of urine drop by drop instead of in a flow, stoppage of urine, blood in urine, etc., are symptoms of kidney-stones.
Causes The kidneys are located one on each side of the body, just below the liver and the spleen. When the liver, busy in its manifold duties, is not entirely capable of doing its job of purifying the blood, the remaining work is taken up by the kidneys.</description>

                <description>Symptoms Leprosy comes about when seven elements of the body are defective:
 chyle blood flesh fat bone marrow shukra  Leprosy has three stages.
Stage 1 The patient starts getting a feeling of discomfort all over the body, suffers from pain in the joints, and feels feverish at odd times.
Often he or she suffers from headaches, and sometimes sweats profusely, sometimes not at all. He or she also suffers from general debility.</description>

                <description>Symptoms Leucoderma, though identified as a disease of the leprosy group, is not as fatal as leprosy, nor are secretions of fluid present.
That is why leucoderma is not a contagious disease. Leprosy attacks due to the disturbance of all seven elements of the body, and severely affects the entire body and mind within a very short time; but with leucoderma, usually only three elements – blood, flesh and fat – become disturbed.</description>

                <description>Symptoms  Swelling and contractures of the muscles or of different joints Acute pain or deformity of the swollen parts, etc.  Causes The causes of this disease are just like those of acidity. It occurs when the váyu bodily air is disturbed due to excess of poisonous acids in the body.
Treatment= Same as for acidity Rheumatism patients should drink a sufficient quantity of water (say four to five seers a day, but not much at a time), and should also observe the bathing and sun-bathing procedures.</description>

                <description>This disease entered India a few centuries ago it from Europe. Many think that it first originated in dogs, and through contact with them the human body got infected.
Symptoms In the first stage, the disease will appear on the genitals as chancres, making the area around them quite hard.
Generally there is no secretion of pus or fluid from them. Then, the chancroid usually appears in the groin.
In most cases, these dry up or heal within a short time.</description>

                <description>Causes  Babies produced from weak or sickly spermatozoa or ova will naturally be weak and emaciated. If the baby does not get sufficient mother’s milk it generally remains emaciated. When due to poverty parents are unable to provide enough milk for their children and consequently they are fed rice and pulse or plain barley from their early childhood, their digestive organs and livers in particular become very weak, and such children normally turn out emaciated.</description>

                <description>Symptoms  A woman between the 16 and 35 being unable to conceive in spite of having sex  But often it is caused by the sterility of the male partner.
Causes  The ova, produced in the ovaries, pass through the Fallopian tubes to reach the uterus.  When the Fallopian tubes are weak, diseased, or blocked by contaminated matter, the ova either fail to reach the uterus or die on the way.</description>

                <description>Yang Ho was desirous of having an interview with Confucius, but on the latter&rsquo;s failing to go and see him, he sent a present of a pig to his house. Confucius went to return his acknowledgments for it at a time when he was not at home. They met, however, on the way.
He said to Confucius, &ldquo;Come, I want a word with you. Can that man be said to have good-will towards his fellow-men who hugs and hides his own precious gifts and allows his country to go on in blind error?</description>

                <description>If it is equally impossible not to put the good among the first principles and to put it among them in this way, then the principles are not being correctly described, nor are the first substances.
Nor does any one conceive the matter correctly if he compares the principles of the universe to that of animals and plants, on the ground that the more complete always comes from the indefinite and incomplete-which is what leads this thinker to say that this is also true of the first principles of reality, so that the One itself is not even an existing thing.</description>

                <description>Senility is a chronic disease that cannot be cured or made to disappear because it is something natural, and natural things do not change.
Many a politically conscious person among the people of the dynasty becomes alert to it and notices the symptoms and causes of senility that have affected his dynasty. He considers it possible to make that senility disappear.
Therefore, he takes it upon himself to repair the dynasty and relieve its temper of senility.</description>

                <description>This substance must be enough.
All philosophers make the first principles contraries= as in natural things, so also in the case of unchangeable substances. But since there cannot be anything prior to the first principle of all things, the principle cannot be the principle and yet be an attribute of something else.
To suggest this is like saying that the white is a first principle, not qua anything else but qua white, but yet that it is predicable of a subject, i.</description>

The method followed in melting it is the same as that of China &ndash; by burning:
 oxide of lead nitrate of potash gypsum  To these materials the Arabs add southern borax which causes the glass to be elastic without being brittle and indifferent to temperature.
In this way, one can put in water for a long time without spoiling it. This makes it more valuable than the Chinese product.</description>

                <description>THE investigation of the truth is in one way hard, in another easy.
No one is able to attain the truth adequately. On the other hand, we do not collectively fail. But everyone says something true about the nature of things.
While individually we contribute little or nothing to the truth, by the union of all a considerable amount is amassed.
Therefore, since the truth seems to be like the proverbial door, which no one can fail to hit, in this respect it must be easy, but the fact that we can have a whole truth and not the particular part we aim at shows the difficulty of it.</description>

                <description>The explanation of the aberration is so simple.
It uses the startling hypothesis that the luminiferous æther passes freely through the sides of the telescope and through the earth itself.
The planets carry a portion of the æther with them so that the æther, close to their surfaces, is at rest relatively on those surfaces. Its velocity changes as we recede ​from the surface, till, at no great distance, it is at rest in space.</description>

                <description>What sort of parts belong to the Form and what sort not to the form, but to the concrete thing?
Yet if this is not plain it is not possible to define any thing; for definition is of the universal and of the form.
If then it is not evident what sort of parts are of the nature of matter and what sort are not, neither will the formula of the thing be evident.</description>

                <description>What is the unity of the formula of a definition? The formula for a man is a &rsquo;two-footed animal'.
Why, then, is this one, and not many, viz. &lsquo;animal&rsquo; and &rsquo;two-footed&rsquo;?
For in the case of &lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;pale&rsquo; there is a plurality when one term does not belong to the other, but a unity when it does belong and the subject, man, has a certain attribute; for then a unity is produced and we have &rsquo;the pale man&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>The substratum and the essence and the compound of these are called substance, so also is the universal.
About two of these we have spoken; both about the essence and about the substratum, of which we have said that it underlies in two senses, either being a &rsquo;this&rsquo;-which is the way in which an animal underlies its attributes-or as the matter underlies the complete reality.
The universal also is thought by some to be in the fullest sense a cause, and a principle; therefore let us attack the discussion of this point also.</description>

                <description>These very facts what consequence confronts those who say the Ideas are substances capable of separate existence, and at the same time make the Form consist of the genus and the differentiae. For if the Forms exist and &lsquo;animal&rsquo; is present in &lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;horse&rsquo;, it is either one and the same in number, or different.

                <description>Substance is of two kinds:
 the concrete thing the formula  (I mean that one kind of substance is the formula taken with the matter, while another kind is the formula in its generality), substances in the former sense are capable of destruction (for they are capable also of generation), but there is no destruction of the formula in the sense that it is ever in course of being destroyed (for there is no generation of it either; the being of house is not generated, but only the being of this house), but without generation and destruction formulae are and are not; for it has been shown that no one begets nor makes these.</description>

                <description>Since some such originative sources are present in soulless things, and others in things possessed of soul, and in soul, and in the rational part of the soul, clearly some potencies will, be non-rational and some will be non-rational and some will be accompanied by a rational formula.
This is why all arts are potentialities. They are originative sources of change in another thing or in the artist himself considered as other.</description>

                <description>If there is nothing apart from individual things, and the individuals are infinitely many, how can we know the infinite individuals?   All things that we come to know, we come to know in so far as they have some unity and identity, and in so far as some attribute belongs to them universally.
&ldquo;But if this is necessary, and there must be something apart from the individuals, it will be necessary that the genera exist apart from the individuals, either the lowest or the highest genera; but we found by discussion just now that this is impossible.</description>

                <description>Are numbers, bodies, planes, and points substances?  If they are not, then what is being and what are the substances of things?
Modifications, movements, relations, dispositions, and ratios do not indicate the substance of anything. All are predicated of a subject, and none is a &rsquo;this'.
And as to the things which might seem most of all to indicate substance, water and earth and fire and air, of which composite bodies consist, heat and cold and the like are modifications of these, not substances, and the body which is thus modified alone persists as something real and as a substance.</description>

                <description>Is each thing and its essence are the same or different?
This is of some use for the inquiry concerning substance; for each thing is thought to be not different from its substance, and the essence is said to be the substance of each thing.
In the case of accidental unities the two would be generally thought to be different, e.g. white man would be thought to be different from the essence of white man.</description>

                <description>Three years have now elapsed since I finished the treatise on all these matters.
I was about to publish it when I learned that persons that I respect had condemned another physics work recently published. That work had nothing prejudicial either to religion or to the state.
This led me to fear that my own doctrines might be interpreted to be against the truth, despite my great care in not offending anyone.</description>

                <description>Why are some things are produced spontaneously as well as by art?
e.g. health, while others are not, e.g. a house.
The reason is that in some cases the matter which governs the production in the making and producing of any work of art, and in which a part of the product is present,-some matter is such as to be set in motion by itself and some is not of this nature, and of the former kind some can move itself in the particular way required, while other matter is incapable of this; for many things can be set in motion by themselves but not in some particular way, e.</description>

                <description>What are the practical consequences, deduced by each party, with regard to obedience to sovereigns?
Justice is founded entirely on the interests of society, which require mutual abstinence from property, in order to preserve peace. Whenever law enforcement has very pernicious consequences during emergencies, justice must be suspended and give way to public utility.
The maxim &rsquo;let justice be performed, even if it destroys the universe&rsquo; is false. It sacrifices the end to the means and shews a preposterous idea of the subordination of duties.</description>

                <description>Confucius Confucius= Self-control, and a habit of falling back upon propriety, virtually effect it.
Let these conditions be fulfilled for one day, and every one round will betake himself to the duty. Is it to begin in one&rsquo;s self, or think you, indeed! it is to begin in others?
 Confucius Without Propriety use not your eyes, ears, tongue, nor any limb of your body.  Confucius When you go forth from your door, be as if you were meeting some guest of importance.</description>

                <description>49. There is an abundant civilization (large population) at the end of dynasties, and pestilences and famines frequently occur then. At the beginning, dynasties are inevitably kind in the exercise of their power and just in their administration. The reason is either their religion, when (the dynasty) is based upon religious propaganda, or their noble and benevolent attitude toward others, which is required by the desert attitude that is natural to dynasties (at the beginning).</description>

The truth about the Fatimid At the end of time a man from the family (of the Prophet) will without fail make his appearance, one who will strengthen the religion and make justice triumph. The Muslims will follow him, and he will gain domination over the Muslim realm.
He will be called the Mahdi. Following him, the Antichrist will appear, together with all the subsequent signs of the Hour (the Day of Judgment), as established in (the sound tradition of) the Sahih.</description>

                <description>Potentiality is related to movement. What is actuality?
The potential, that we not only ascribe potency to that whose nature it is to move something else, or to be moved by something else, either without qualification or in some particular way, but also use the word in another sense, which is the reason of the inquiry in the course of which we have discussed these previous senses also.
Actuality, then, is the existence of a thing not in the way which we express by &lsquo;potentially&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>Duke Ling of Wei was consulting Confucius about army arrangements.
Confucius Had you asked me about such things as temple requisites, I have learnt that business, but I have not yet studied military matters.  He followed up this reply by leaving on the following day.
After this, during his residence in the State of Ch&rsquo;in, his followers, owing to a stoppage of food supply, became so weak and ill that not one of them could stand.</description>

                <description>Pappus tells us that the ancients made a great account of the science of mechanics in investigating natural things. The moderns laid aside the substantial forms and occult qualities and instead have subjected Nature to the laws of mathematics.
The ancients viewed mechanics in two respects:
 rational= this proceeds accurately by demonstration practical mechanics= this includes all the manual arts. Mechanics got its name from those arts  But manual workers are not perfectly accurate.</description>

                <description>1. Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing. 2. Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing. 3. In God, there is necessarily the idea of his essence and also of all things which necessarily follow from his essence. 4. The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one. 5. The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only as he is considered as a thinking thing, not as he is unfolded in any other attribute.</description>

For each must exist in itself, and be conceived through itself. In other words, the conception of one does not imply the conception of the other.  3. Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other. 4. Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from the other, either=  by the difference of the attributes of the substances, or the difference of their modifications.</description>

                <description>Postulates  The human body can be affected in many ways which increases or reduces its power of activity. It can also be affected in other ways which do not change this power.  Note= This postulate or axiom rests on Postulate 1 and Lemmas 5 and 7, which is after 2.13. The human body can undergo many changes.
Nevertheless, it can retain=

                <description>11. The first element, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually existing. 12. Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea, which constitutes the human mind, must be perceived by the human mind, or there will necessarily be an idea in the human mind of the said occurrence. That is, if the object of the idea constituting the human mind be a body, nothing can take place in that body without being perceived by the mind.</description>

                <description>15. Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure, pain, or desire. Proof= Let it be granted that the mind is simultaneously affected by two emotions, of which one neither increases nor diminishes its power of activity, and the other does either increase or reduce the said power (3. Post. 1).
Corollary= Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain, though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate it.</description>

                <description>Proposition 18 Theorem 16= The axes of planets The axes of the planets are less than the diameters drawn perpendicularly to the axes.
The equal gravitation would give a spherical shape to the planets. But the circular motion causes the parts to recede from the axis and go to the equator in a fluid state. This enlarges the diameters there and flatten the poles.
Thus, Jupiter&rsquo;s diameter is shorter between pole and pole than from east to west.</description>

                <description>21. This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body. 22. The human mind perceives not only the modifications of the body, but also the ideas of such modifications. The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.  The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the parts composing the human body.</description>

                <description>30. Intellect, in function (actu) finite, or in function infinite, must comprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God, and nothing else. 31. The intellect in function, whether finite or infinite, as will, desire, love, etc., should be referred to passive nature and not to active nature. 32. Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary cause. 33. Things could not have been brought into being by God in any manner or in any order different from that which has in fact obtained.</description>

                <description>Part 2= Common ideas 31. We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things external to ourselves. Corollary Hence it follows that all particular things are contingent and perishable.
 All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God, are true. Proof= All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with their objects (2.7. Coroll.), therefore (1. Ax. 6) they are all true.</description>

                <description>33. When we love a thing similar to ourselves we endeavour, as far as we can, to bring about that it should love us in return. 34. The greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected towards us, the greater will be our complacency. If anyone conceives, that an object of his love joins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he himself has attained to, he will be affected with hatred towards the loved object and with envy towards his rival.</description>

                <description>If a man has begun to hate an object of his love, so that love is thoroughly destroyed, he will, causes being equal, regard it with more hatred than if he had never loved it, and his hatred will be in proportion to the strength of his former love. Proof= If a man begins to hate that which he had loved, more of his appetites are put under restraint than if he had never loved it.</description>

                <description>When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity, it feels pleasure= and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity.  The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity.  When the mind contemplates its own weakness, it feels pain thereat.  Corollary= This pain is more and more fostered, if a man conceives that he is blamed by others; this may be proved in the same way as the corollary to 3.</description>

                <description>9. The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas, endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this endeavour it is conscious. 10. An idea, which excludes the existence of our body, cannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto. 11. Whatsoever increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of activity in our body, the idea thereof increases or diminishes, helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind.</description>

                <description>In ancient times, the common practice was to hoard up treasures during peacetime for paying conquest or defence during wartime. They did not resort to taxation or borrowing in times of disorder and confusion.
 The Athenians, Ptolemies, and the other successors of Alexander amassed immense large sums. Plato says that the frugal Spartans had also collected a great treasure. Arrian and Plutarch took notice of Alexander&rsquo;s riches from the conquest of Susa and Ecbatana, which came from the time of Cyrus.</description>

                <description>If what we have described is identical with the capable or convertible with it, evidently it cannot be true to say &rsquo;this is capable of being but will not be&rsquo;, which would imply that the things incapable of being would on this showing vanish.
E.g. a man-one who did not take account of that which is incapable of being-were to say that the diagonal of the square is capable of being measured but will not be measured, because a thing may well be capable of being or coming to be, and yet not be or be about to be.</description>

                <description>Assume a railway carriage travelling uniformly, as a &lsquo;uniform translation&rsquo;:
 uniform: constant velocity and direction translation: although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate  A raven is also flying uniformly in a straight line, as observed from the embankment. If we observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage, the raven&rsquo;s motion would be of different velocity and direction. But it would still be uniform and in a straight line.</description>

The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it.</description>

 absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and common.  1. Time Absolute, true, and mathematical time flow equably without regard to anything external. It is also called duration.
Relative, apparent, and common time, is a sensible and external measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used. Examples are= an hour, a day, a month, a year.</description>

Therefore, the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy&rsquo;s will to be imposed on him.
By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.</description>

                <description>Tsz-chang= The learned official who when he sees danger ahead will risk his very life, who when he sees a chance of success is mindful of what is just and proper, who in his religious acts is mindful of the duty of reverence, and when in mourning thinks of his loss, is indeed a fit and proper person for his place.&quot;
If a person hold to virtue but never advance in it, and if he have faith in right principles and do not build himself up in them, how can he be regarded either as having such, or as being without them?</description>

   Name Description Strategy     Accessible ground can be freely traversed by both sides occupy the raised and sunny spots before the enemy, to fight with advantage. Carefully guard your line of supplies   Entangling ground can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared and your attack fails, then it will be disaster   Temporizing ground neither side will gain by making the first move You should retreat to lure the enemy out and then attack him   Narrow passes  garrison this strongly and await the enemy.</description>

                <description>I created a provisory code of morals with a few maxims while we rebuild the philosophical house that we live in.
Maxim 1: Obey the laws and customs of my country France I adhere firmly to the faith I had been educated from my childhood. For as I had from that time begun to hold my own opinions for nought because I wished to subject them all to examination, I was convinced that I could not do better than follow in the meantime the opinions of the most judicious;</description>

                <description>The philosophers assure us that above the clouds there is an aethereal air much subtler than ours.
That air is not composed of vapors of the earth, but is an element in itself. Above this air there is another, much subtler body, which they call the element of fire.
These two elements are mixed with liquids and solids of all the inferior bodies. This aethereal air and fire fill the in-between spaces* among the parts of the real air that we breathe.</description>

                <description>Let&rsquo;s think about a universe, beyond this one, confined in imaginary spaces which are infinite. Let us go back in time after all the matter has been created. At this point, the aethereal has filled all. We limit our space to the distance from the earth to the distant stars. This space has nothing other than the aether.
This aether can be divided into any parts and according to any shapes.</description>

                <description>The simplest law in physics is the one that says how light travels in empty space in straight lines with a velocity of 300,000 km/sec.
This velocity is the same for all colours, because if this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star by its dark neighbour.

                <description>1. Both Bedouins and sedentary people are natural groups. Their differences are from the different ways in which they make their living.
Social organization enables them to cooperate toward that end and to start with the simple necessities of life, before they get to conveniences and luxuries.
 Some people adopt agriculture, the cultivation of vegetables and grains, (as their way of making a living). Others adopt animal husbandry, the use of sheep, cattle, goats, bees, and silkworms, for breeding and for their products.</description>

What is the length of the metre rod relative to the non-moving K?
This is answered by asking where the beginning and end of the rod lie with respect to non-moving K at a time t of non-moving K.</description>

                <description>I have already warned of confusing profits with interest. Interest includes all returns from using capital, not just payments from borrower to lender.
The economic meaning excludes compensation for risk — which makes up a great part of interest. But compensation for risk is merely an equalization of return between different uses of capital.
Rates also vary considerably in different countries and at different times. Interest generally has been higher in the United States than in England.</description>

                <description>What are the principles and causes of the things that are of being?
There is a cause of health and of good condition. The objects of mathematics have first principles and elements and causes, and in general every science which is ratiocinative or at all involves reasoning deals with causes and principles, more or less precise, all these sciences mark off some particular being-some genus, and inquire into this, but not into being simply nor qua being, nor do they offer any discussion of the essence of the things of which they treat;</description>

                <description>In a free government, the abolition of all distinctions of party may not be practicable, perhaps not desirable.
The only dangerous parties are those that aim to change the:
 essentials of government, succession of the crown, or considerable privileges of several members of the constitution  They prefer violence over compromise.
The parties in England had this animosity for over the last 100 years, which caused civil war sometimes. Recently, there have been the strongest universal desire to form a coaltion and abolish these party distinctions.</description>

                <description>God put inequality and confusion among the parts of matter at the beginning.
The parts were then reduced to:
 one size, and one middling motion.  It thus took the form of the aethereal air.
Before it was moved by God, the hardest and most solid body in the world*.

 This equality could not be totally perfect because:
 There is no void at all in the aethereal world.</description>

The differences of Muslim opinion concerning the laws and conditions governing the caliphate The institution called &ldquo;the Caliphate&rdquo; or &ldquo;imamate&rdquo; substitutes for Muhammad in as much as it serves, like him, to preserve the religion and to exercise (political) leadership of the world.
Its leader is &ldquo;the caliph&rdquo; or &ldquo;the imam.&rdquo; In later times, he has also been called &ldquo;the sultan,&rdquo; when there were numerous (claimants to the position) or when, in view of the distances (separating the different regions) and in disregard of the conditions governing the institution, people were forced to render the oath of allegiance to anybody who seized power.</description>

Chapter 3 stated that each dynasty has its specific share of provinces and districts and no more. 715 Its expansion depends 716 on the distribution of the dynasty&rsquo;s group (strength) for the (military) protection of its territory and regions.
Wherever its numbers go, their advance (eventually) comes to a stop at (what is called) the &ldquo;border region.</description>

Consider the moon at B (where you can suppose it to be immobile in comparison with the speed at which the matter of the heaven below it moves), and consider that this matter of the heaven, having less space to pass through between O and 6 than between B and 6 (if the moon does not occupy the space between O and B), and consequently having to move a bit faster there, cannot fail to have the force to push the whole earth a little bit toward D, so that its center T moves away (as you can see) a little bit from the point M, which is the center of the small heaven ABCD.</description>

                <description>We can move clocks and measuring-rods only with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light. Hence, we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the reality.
But, on the other hand, these results must strike you as being very singular. This is why I draw another conclusion from the theory.
In Section 6, we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics.</description>

                <description>FROM a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction.
Theories are evolved, and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison.
Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue.</description>

                <description>How do the inhabitants of Earth see the face of their heaven as wholly like that of ours?
First, they must see the body marked S as completely full of light and like our sun, given that that body sends rays from all points of its surface toward their eyes.
Because it is much closer to them than the stars, it must appear much greater to them. The parts of the small heaven ABCD that turns about the earth offer some resistance to those rays.</description>

This causes people to look for alternative resource systems that are more sustainable. This in turn puts more non-mainstream economic proposals, both good and bad, to the public view. In this post, we shall discuss a bad proposal called the Steady State Economy.

                <description>A definition is a formula. Every formula has parts. The formula to the thing is the part of the formula to the part of the thing.
Must the formula of the parts be present in the formula of the whole or not?
For in some cases the formulae of the parts are seen to be present, and in some not. The formula of the circle does not include that of the segments, but that of the syllable includes that of the letters; yet the circle is divided into segments as the syllable is into letters.</description>

A magnet that attracts a piece of iron does not do so in empty space, but through a magnetic field, as per Faraday.
 In its turn, this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the iron moves towards the magnet.  This idea is arbitrary. Nevertheless, it represents electromagnetic phenomena and is applied to the transmission of electromagnetic waves.</description>

                <description>Upon entering our bodies through the finger of Jupiter, the first line reached by the Electric Current is the line of Heart. It is so named because it accurately reflects the heart&rsquo;s condition and operation.
It deals with that central life-sustaining mechanism which pumps and controls the blood stream, which, by its quantity and quality, so largely affects our health and temperament.
The line of Heart rises from some point under or near the finger of Jupiter.</description>

                <description>Our experience shows that=
 the principle of relativity holds true, and the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant c  By uniting these two postulates, we obtained=
 the law of transformation for co-ordinates x, y, z and the time t of the events in nature  This led to the Lorentz transformation and not the Galilei transformation of classical mechanics. The constant speed of light played an important part in this.</description>

                <description>From the description of inanimate bodies and plants, I passed to animals, particularly to man.
God formed the body of man wholly like to one of ours, as well in the external shape of the members as in the internal conformation of the organs, of the same matter with that I had described, and at first placed in it no rational soul, nor any other principle, in room of the vegetative or sensitive soul, beyond kindling in the heart one of those fires without light, such as I had already described, and which I thought was not different from the heat in hay that has been heaped together before it is dry, or that which causes fermentation in new wines before they are run clear of the fruit.</description>

                <description>"Mankind are earthen jugs with spirits in them." Hawthorne  THE human body is the earthly tenement of the mind or soul. In its construction and operation is very like a mechanical engine.
Every mechanical engine is built upon the plan that will best enable it to do the kind of work it is intended to perform ; some are so small that their mission is to become the interior works of a watch; some are built to propel a locomotive at high speed, and others to furnish power to some gigantic manufacturing establishment.</description>

                <description>Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment simultaneously at two places A and B far distant from each other.
 A meteorologist discovered that the lightning must always strike A and B simultaneously.  How do we test if the lightning really did strike the two places at the same time? What does &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo; mean?
We test simultaniety by putting an observer in the middle M between A and B.</description>

                <description>The Cause of Human Progress IF OUR CONCLUSIONS ARE CORRECT they will fall under a larger generalization. We may rephrase our question, then, from a broader perspective=
What is the law of human progress?
Whether humans gradually developed from animals is not the question here. Inference cannot proceed from the unknown to the known. However humans may have originated, we can know our species only as we find it now. There is no trace of humans in any lower state than that of primitive people still found today.</description>

                <description>Law 1 Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or uniform motion unless it is compelled to change that state by external forces impressed on it.
 PROJECTILES persevere in their motions so far as they are not retarded by air resistance, or impelled downwards by gravity. A spinning top does not stop unless it is resisted by air. Planets and comets retain their motion as there is less resistance in outer space  Law 2 The change of motion is proportional to the external motive force impressed.</description>

Emerson  Lines found in certain places always indicate the same thing. Certain formations of these lines invariably show the good, bad, or weak operation of the things they indicate.
Lines show details of the life. When events have strongly impressed themselves on the brain, the lines have appeared, disappeared, broken, or changed in certain parts of the hand as these events have produced good or bad results for the subject.</description>

                <description>The line of the Head is the second line which receives the Electric Current when it enters our bodies through the finger of Jupiter. It runs across the hand below the line of Heart.
It absolutely indicates the subject&rsquo;s:
 amount of mentality kind of mentality power of mental concentration ability to exert self-control.  The mind plays a tremendous part in the shaping of our destiny.
No matter how fine the rest of the human machine may be, it can never operate perfectly unless there is a proper mental attitude.</description>

                <description>Sections 8-10 show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity (Section 7) arises from two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics=
  The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of the body of reference
  The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid body is independent of the body of reference
  If we drop those two, then the dilemma of Section 7 disappears, because the addition of velocities (Section 6) becomes invalid*.</description>

Democritus thinks there are three kinds of difference between things:
 their rhythm (shape) their turning (position) their intercontact (order)  The underlying body (matter) is one and the same, but they differ in those three.</description>

                <description>THE third Mount type is the Apollonian, and the parts of the hand which identify him are the Mount and finger of Apollo.
This is a pleasant type to handle because it is a good type.
The Apollonian sometimes becomes mercenary and shoddy but he does not often become bad or criminal.
Saturn and Mercury, the bilious types, become bad and vicious.
While the others are sometimes coarse, they do not often descend to criminality.</description>

As single signs, or in combination with each other, the grille, cross-bars, cross, island, or dot indicate defects of the Mount either of health or of character, the main lines, chance lines, color, etc., will determine which.
There are a few variations of this rule as applied to some of the Mounts.</description>

                <description>THE fourth Mount type is the Mercurian, who is identified by the Mount and Finger of Mercury.
He is always pronounced in his characteristics, and has great power as an orator, a scientist, a physician, or a lawyer, and is also very successful in business. The first aim, with every subject of this type, should be to discover which of his several phases is strongest, and whether the good or bad side is dominant, for of all the types, none gives way to dishonesty with more ease than the Mercurian.</description>

                <description>The Saturnian is the second type to be considered, and the parts of the hand by which he is identified are the Mount and finger of Saturn.
The higher the Mount of Saturn is developed, the larger and longer the finger, and the squarer the tip of this finger, the more pronounced is the type of the subject.
A highly developed Mount of Saturn is a rarity, and in the greatest number of hands there is instead a depression.</description>

This is strengthened by the=
 triangle circle square, or single vertical lines  The cross, grille, island or dot show defects of the Mount (127).
This Mount rises into the palm, has the largest prominence shown by any of the Mounts, and by its size and markings you must estimate the amount and kind of Venusian qualities possessed by the subject.</description>

                <description>Light naturally exists in the stars and flame, or fire.
Movement in Parts When flame burns wood, we see that it moves the small parts of the wood and separates them from one another.
 This transforms the subtler parts into fire, air, and smoke, and leaving the grosser parts as ashes.  Body A cannot move Body B unless Body A itself were also moving [7].
It means that the flame&rsquo;s body that acts against the wood is composed of small parts*.</description>

 being as being and the attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature.  This is not the same as any of the so-called special sciences. None of these others treats universally of being as being. They cut off a part of being and investigate the attribute of this part.
The mathematical sciences, on the other hand, do this.
This Science explains the first principles and the highest causes.</description>

                <description>The parts of the matter are very diverse. Most of them take the form of the aethereal fire or the aethereal air from breaking and dividing by collision with one another.
Nevertheless, among them are two sorts that had to retain the form of the third element:
 Those which had shapes so extended and so impeding that, when they collided with one another, it was easier for them to join together.</description>

                <description>No party in the present age can support itself without philosophical principles annexed to its political or practical one.
Thus all factions in England have thought of speculative principles to protect and cover their scheme of actions.
The people are commonly very rude builders, especially in this speculative way. This is more true when actuated by party-zeal. Their projects become a little unshapely, with marks of that violence and hurry, in which it was raised.</description>

Non-Euclidean geometry says that outer space is not infinite (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions were already answered fully by Helmholtz and Poincaré=
In a 2D space, flat beings with flat implements and flat rigid measuring-rods are free to move in a plane. For them, nothing exists outside of this plane. The constructions of plane Euclidean geometry can be done through the rods, e.g. the lattice construction, considered in Section 24.</description>

 It travels in all directions about bodies that are&quot;luminous&quot; It travels to any distance It travels in an instant It travels ordinarily in straight lines, as rays of light These rays coming from diverse points can come together at the same point These rays coming from the same point can go out toward different points These rays coming from diverse points and going toward diverse points, can pass through the same point without impeding one another They can also sometimes impede one another, to wit, when their force is very unequal and that of some of the rays is much greater than that of the others They can be diverted by reflection They can be diverted by refraction Their force can be increased Their force can be diminished, by the diverse dispositions or qualities of the matter that receives them  There are the principal qualities that one observes in light and that all agree with this action.</description>

No science troubles itself about it  For on the one hand he who produces a house does not produce all the attributes that come into being along with the house; for these are innumerable; the house that has been made may quite well be pleasant for some people, hurtful for some, and useful to others, and different-to put it shortly from all things that are; and the science of building does not aim at producing any of these attributes.</description>

                <description>Some people believe that the Ideas exist as numbers. They do this by setting out each term apart from its instances. Out of the unity of each general term, they try to explain why number must exist.
Their reasons, however, are neither conclusive nor possible in themselves. This is why we should not assert the existence of number.
The Pythagoreans saw many attributes of numbers belonging to sensible bodies. They supposed real things to be numbers themselves.</description>

                <description>At the beginning of the dynasty, taxation yields a large revenue from small assessments. At the end of the dynasty, taxation yields a small revenue from large assessments.
This is because when the dynasty follows the ways (sunan) of the religion, it imposes only such taxes as are stipulated by the religious law, such as charity taxes, the land tax, and the poll tax. They mean small assessments, because, as everyone knows, the charity tax on property 649 is low.</description>

If the ruler holds on to property and revenue, or if they are lost or not properly used by him, then the property in the possession of the ruler&rsquo;s entourage 675 will be small.

The complexity and interdependence of production Problems with money and credit The artificial barriers of protective tariffs.  Nonetheless, land speculation is the primary cause producing recessions.
As population grows and technology advances, land values rise. This steady increase leads to speculation which anticipates future increases. This raises Land values beyond the point at which labor and capital would receive their customary returns.</description>

                <description>But according to Section 22, General Relativity (GR) cannot retain this law because, to GR, the speed of light must always depend on the coordinates when a gravitational field is present.
Section 23 explained that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition of the co-ordinates and the time of SR.
According to GR, the space-time continuum cannot be Euclidean like the marble slab (with a hot center and cool sides) as an example of a 2D continuum.</description>

                <description>We can now use Gaussian coordinates to formulate more exactly the Minkowski spacetime in Section 17. According to Special Relativity (SR), Galileian coordinate systems are preferred for describing a 4D space-time continuum.
The 4 co-ordinates x, y, z, t determine an event or a point of the 4D continuum. For the transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid.</description>

                <description>According General Relativity (GR), the geometrical properties of space are determined by matter.Thus, we can draw conclusions about the universe&rsquo;s geometrical structure based on matter.
The velocities of the stars are small as compared with the speed of light. From this, we can conclude the nature of the universe.
The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields caused by the distribution of matter. This eliminates the need for the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe.</description>

Assuming there is Point A and B are on a rigid body. We can draw a line joining them starting from Point A. We can mark off the distance S time after* time until we reach B. The number of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance AB.</description>

                <description>How could Nature untangle the confusion of the chaos after creation? What are the laws of nature that God has imposed on her?
God created the &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; which determine how changes take place in the universe.
Matter:
 has naturally diverse motions since the beginning when they were created, touches one another on all sides, without any void in between they collide with each other when they move.  Rule 1: State Continuity Rule 1: A body always continues in the same state unless a collision with others causes it to change that state.</description>

                <description>It is part of royal and governmental pomp and dynastic custom to have the names of rulers or their peculiar marks embroidered on the silk, brocade, or pure silk garments that they wear.
The writing is done by weaving a gold or colored thread different from the fabric&rsquo;s color. It depends on the skill of the weavers.
Royal garments are embroidered with such a tiraz, in order:
 to increase the prestige of the ruler or some other person the ruler distinguishes  The pre-Islamic non-Arab rulers used to make a tiraz of pictures and figures of kings, or (other) figures and pictures specifically (designed) for it.</description>

                <description>The unequal distribution of wealth is caused by private land ownership. As long private property exists, no increase in production will permanently benefit the masses. On the contrary, any improvements must depress their condition further.
Poverty deepens as wealth increases. Wages fall while productivity grows. This is all because land, the source of all wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized.
Unequal ownership of land causes unequal distribution of wealth.</description>

                <description>What is the cause of the unity of definitions and numbers?
In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something beside the parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such quality.
A definition is a set of words which is one not by being connected together, like the Iliad, but by dealing with one object.</description>

                <description>Raising an army of 100,000 men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State.
The daily expenditure will amount to 1,000 ounces of silver. There will be commotion at home and abroad. Men will drop down exhausted on the highways. As many as 700,000 families will be impeded in their labor.
Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day.</description>

Thus that, if the aether were one of them, then, we would sense it so very faintly that it could not be as material nor as solid as those other bodies [matter] that we sense more clearly.</description>

                <description>The spirit of the Ni Ten Ichi school of strategy is based on water.
This Water Book explains methods of victory as the long-sword form of the Ichi school. This can be grasped intuitively. The principles of strategy are written down here in terms of single combat, but you must think broadly so that you attain an understanding for ten-thousand-a-side battles.
Strategy is different from other things in that if you mistake the Way even a little you will become bewildered and fall into bad ways.</description>

                <description>JULY 1,1935
We investigate the possibility of an atomistic theory of matter and electricity which, while excluding singularities of the ﬁeld, uses only gm of General Relativity and Maxwell&rsquo;s theory.
Through a simple example, these modify slightly the gravitational equations. This then allows regular solutions for the static spherically symmetric case.
These solutions involve the mathematical representation of physical space by a space of two identical sheets which has a particle acting as a “bridge” connecting these sheets.</description>

                <description>In this the Fire Book of the Ni To Ichi school of strategy I describe fighting as fire.
In the first place, people think narrowly about the benefit of strategy.
By using only their fingertips, they only know the benefit of three of the five inches of the wrist. They let a contest be decided, as with the folding fan, merely by the span of their forearms. They specialise in the small matter of dexterity, learning such trifles as hand and leg movements with the bamboo practice sword.</description>

                <description>The Ni To Ichi Way of Strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void. What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in man&rsquo;s knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void.
People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not understand must be the void.</description>

                <description>In strategy you must know the Ways of other schools, so I have written about various other traditions of strategys in this the Wind Book.
Without knowledge of the Ways of other schools, it is difficult to understand the essence of my Ichi school. Looking at other schools we find some that specialise in techniques of strength using extra-long swords.
Some schools study the Way of the short sword, known as kodachi.</description>

                <description>THERE are several senses in which a thing may be said to &lsquo;be&rsquo;
In one sense the &lsquo;being&rsquo; meant is &lsquo;what a thing is&rsquo; or a &rsquo;this&rsquo;
In another sense it means a quality or quantity or one of the other things that are predicated as these are.
While &lsquo;being&rsquo; has all these senses, obviously that which &lsquo;is&rsquo; primarily is the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, which indicates the substance of the thing. For when we say of what quality a thing is, we say that it is good or bad, not that it is three cubits long or that it is a man; but when we say what it is, we do not say &lsquo;white&rsquo; or &lsquo;hot&rsquo; or &rsquo;three cubits long&rsquo;, but &lsquo;a man&rsquo; or &lsquo;a &lsquo;god&rsquo;.</description>

                <description>There cannot be an intermediate between contradictories.
One subject must either affirm or deny any one predicate.
This is clear if we define what the true and the false are.
To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false,
while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true
So that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either what is true or what is false;</description>

ds2 = - (1/1-2m/r) dr2 - r2 (d 2 + sin2 d 2) + (1-2m/r)dt2 (5) (r&gt;2m, θ from 0 to 7r, «5 from 0 to r); the variables x1, x2, x3, x4 are here r, Φ, t.
The vanishing of the determinant of the guv for 0= 0 is unimportant, since the corresponding (spatial) direction is not preferred. On the other hand gm for r=2m becomes inﬁnite and hence we have there a singularity.</description>

When in difficult country, do not encamp.
In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem.
In desperate position, you must fight.
There are:
 roads which must not be followed armies which must be not attacked towns which must be besieged positions which must not be contested commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.</description>

 Pass quickly over mountains Keep in the neighborhood of valleys.  Camp in high places, facing the sun.
Do not climb heights in order to fight. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.
When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack.</description>

There is a force that unites all its parts and that makes them all tend toward its center, according to its size and solidity.
The parts of the aether surrounding it turns much faster than its parts about its center. This also causes them to move away with more force from its center and consequently to push the parts of the earth back toward its center.</description>

                <description>&ldquo;The word &lsquo;substance&rsquo; is applied in 4 ways:
 the essence the universal the genus, These are thought to be the substance of each thing, the substratum  Now the substratum is that of which everything else is predicated, while it is itself not predicated of anything else.
What is the nature of the substratum?
In some senses, matter is:
 a substratum a shape the compound of these  By the matter I mean, for instance, the bronze, by the shape the pattern of its form, and by the compound of these the statue, the concrete whole.</description>

                <description>What is &ldquo;actual&rdquo;?
We must distinguish when a thing exists potentially and when it does not. For it is not at any and every time.
E.g. is earth potentially a man? No-but rather when it has already become seed, and perhaps not even then.
It is just as it is with being healed; not everything can be healed by the medical art or by luck, but there is a certain kind of thing which is capable of it, and only this is potentially healthy.</description>

                <description>Can eternal things consist of elements?
If they do, they will have matter for everything that consists of elements is composite.
Since, then, even if a thing exists for ever, out of that of which it consists it would necessarily also, if it had come into being, have come into being, and since everything comes to be what it comes to be out of that which is it potentially (for it could not have come to be out of that which had not this capacity, nor could it consist of such elements), and since the potential can be either actual or not.</description>

                <title>Why Traditional Theories of Wages Are Wrong</title>

                <description>Why does poverty persist despite increasing wealth?
The decline of wages also leads to poverty. So why do wages decrease to subsistence level, even when productive power increases?
Current theory explains that=
 wages are set by the ratio between the number of workers and the amount of capital available for labor population increases faster than the increase in capital therefore, wages always move toward the lowest level that the workers will tolerate.</description>

                <description>175  There are no public educational institutions for women. There is accordingly nothing useless, absurd, or fantastic in their common education.
They are taught what their parents judge necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else.
Their education is used to improve the natural attractions of their person, form their mind to reserve, modesty, chastity, and economy, make them the mistresses of a family, and make them behave properly when they have become such.</description>

                <description>Yama Yama is divided into five:
 Ahiḿsá – Not to inflict pain or hurt on any living thing in the world by thought, word or action Satya – The benevolent use of mind and words Asteya – To renounce the desire to acquire or retain the wealth of others.
