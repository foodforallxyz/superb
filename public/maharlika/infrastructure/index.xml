      <description>Climate change can happen both naturally and articially. In Asia, the most famous incidence of climate change happened in Cambodia wherein an entire large city &amp;ndash; Angkor Wat &amp;ndash; had to be abandoned to nature.
What caused Angkor Wat to fail? Unlike most large cities that are built beside a river, Angkor Wat was built next to a lake. Artificial canals were then built to irrigate the land to grow rice and other crops.</description>

      <title>Why EDSA traffic can never be solved</title>

      <description>EDSA traffic can never be solved just as Bangkok’s traffic can never be solved — because its design does not match its current use.
An example of a city with a wrong design is Bangkok. It has the worst traffic because its roads are arbitrary and traces the canals which were used to demarcate private property. Such property was not designed to maximize the flow of transportation, but were created arbitrarily.</description>

      <title>Why Malls are Popular in the Philippines</title>

      <description>Supermalls in the Philippines are the product of Henry Sy when he built SM North Edsa in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s. Back then, malls took the form of department stores such as Isettan in Cubao.
Sy&amp;rsquo;s innovation was to add an airconditioned environment to the usual area of retail shops. This made shopping cool, clean, and convenient, which is a major improvement in polluted urban centers.
The trend of rising power rates arising from the evil privatization of electricity and water made malls even more appealing.</description>
