      <description>In Book 1 of A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume laid out his principle of the self.
According to him, &amp;lsquo;identity&amp;rsquo; is a perception of something that is separate from another perception. For example, the identity of a car&amp;rsquo;s tire is a separate identity from the car because our minds can perceive them as separately existing.
If our minds cannot separate them, then their identity is one. An example is the balloon of a hot air balloon which cannot be separated without destroying its vehicle&amp;rsquo;s identity.</description>
