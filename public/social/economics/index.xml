      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve started the long process of building a textbook, which actually is supposed to be a user&amp;rsquo;s manual for the developers and operators of our proposed economic system called the Pantry Points .
After we discovered the four laws of value, it became irresistable how we could organize all of Pantrynomics elegantly under them. Every concept in economics, from econometrics, open market operations, supply and demand, taxation, etc, can be put under four huge headings!</description>

      <title>Two DCTI Scenarios from Pantrynomics</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/dcti-scenarios/</link>

      <description>Hunter-Gatherer Scenario Figure 1. A single hunter who consumes all the work of his industry   This scenario illustrates the DCTI model in the simplest form without trade. To meet the hunger (demand) of the hunter, he must gather his equipment and skill (capital) to hunt an animal (industry), which he will consume to satisfy his hunger.
Advancing Society Scenario Figure 2. A simple scenario illustrating how societies get wealthier through time   It starts with fixed capital (light blue bar), unlike the hunter-gatherer scenario which had none.</description>

      <title>Why is Business Usually Seen as Immoral?</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/why-business-is-immoral/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/why-business-is-immoral/</guid>
      <description>Summary: Business is based on money which really is just quantitative information. It is unable to carry qualitative information such as morality. Contracts, on the other hand, can carry such information and are a better foundation of the economy.
 In some societies, especially Eastern ones, business is usually looked down upon. In ancient China and Japan, merchants were not respected and were even oppressed.
In fact, both China and Japan closed off their doors to foreign trade.</description>

      <title>Why Quantitative Easing Failed</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/why-qe-failed/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/why-qe-failed/</guid>
      <description>Japan launched Quantitative Easing (QE) as part of Abenomics which was announced in 2012, just as the US launched theirs after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Both actions failed to drive economic growth* for both countries and merely resulted in additional public debt.
 *The growth in the US really came from Trump&amp;rsquo;s fiscal reforms and trade war
 To explain why QE was used and why it failed, we need to go back to 1913.</description>

      <title>The 1772 Credit Crunch</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/1772-credit-crunch/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/1772-credit-crunch/</guid>
      <description>In 1772, a credit crisis originating in London hit and spread over Europe and affected the American colonies.
The cause was the creation and over-circulation of bounced checks then known as redrawn bills of exchange. Speculators used these bills to gamble with bank money and the deposits of other people. The end result was a loss of capital, creating a credit crunch, which led to an economic downturn hitting Europe and too-big-to-fail companies.</description>

      <title>The 3 Problems with Money</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/problems-with-money/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/problems-with-money/</guid>
      <description>People have loved money ever since it was invented. The philosophers David Hume and Socrates, on the other hand, were not so keen on money because of its drawbacks, which we distill into three:
1. Money builds ego Having a lot of money gives theego power over other egos, giving a feeling of superiority to the monied-ego, leading to arbitrary actions which encroaches on other egos, creatinginjusticeand eventually,evil.
A dirt-poor evil bum can hurt a few people, but an ultra rich evil man can hurt so many.</description>

      <title>Neoclassical Economics vs Classical Economics</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/neoclassical-classical/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/neoclassical-classical/</guid>
      <description>Pantrynomics is our revival of Classical Economics, backed up by actual data which is visualized through data science and analytics. This data spans 2,500 years, from Xenophon&amp;rsquo;s The Economist up to the latest GDP data.
In contrast, Modern Economics only began from the Marginal Revolution of the 1870&amp;rsquo;s. This makes it a toy idea that crashed quickly after 50 years as the Great Crash and Depression. Nowadays, this toy idea manifests as gaming via game theory, the stock market, and cryptocurrencies, all coming from the mercantile game of buying low and selling high.</description>

      <title>Alternatives to Money as Store of Value</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/alternatives-to-money/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/alternatives-to-money/</guid>
      <description>Both Economics and Mercantilism use money as their store of value and tool of trade. Mercantilism was also called the Commercial system and now takes the form of E-commerce.
To buy anything online, you need a credit card or any electronic system to transfer cash payments. Prior to commercialization, the universal method was barter. For example, the Mongols and the Inca were able to sustain their empires by bartering goods and services.</description>

      <description>Jeff Bezos recently announced his vision of moving polluting industries to the moon in order to save the Earth, using his reusable rockets. His logic is that the gravity in the moon is 1/6 of that of the Earth and so moon-based industries will require less energy.
It&amp;rsquo;s surprising that no one has pointed out to him that his rockets emit pollution and CO2. It would take so many polluting rocket launches to move heavy industries to the moon.</description>

      <title>How to Survive in the Music Industry</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/music-industry/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/music-industry/</guid>
      <description>Taylor Swift&amp;rsquo;s op-ed in The Wall Street Journal shows her continued optimism in the music industry despite its continued downturn caused by the popularity of digital music. She defends her optimism by viewing music as valueable art which can still sell, especially if the buyer falls in love with an artist.
The Pantrynomics of Music While many musicians are alarmed at the decline of the price of their valuable art, Adam Smith assures us that its decline is actually natural:</description>

      <title>The 4 Branches of Pantrynomics</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/four-branches/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/four-branches/</guid>
      <description>Currently, Economics has messy divisions arising from the lack of understanding of the nature of societies and the human species:
 Microeconomics Macroeconomics Development Economics Welfare Economics Behavioral Economics Political Economy   The Four Laws of Value of Pantrynomics streamlines this into four branches:
  Personal Economy   This includes demographic data, as well as personal physical and psychological data in order to see the granular supply and demand of any society.</description>

      <title>The Inverted Yield Curve</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/inverted-yield-curve/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/inverted-yield-curve/</guid>
      <description>To understand the inverted yield curve, we have to understand the nature of bonds .
What are bonds? A bond is a loan to government, giving them private capital to spend for public uses. However, unlike a normal loan which is paid back in full and can be ended, a bond is a perpetual debt.
The investor enters this perpetual lending scheme by buying the bond and then exits at maturity by selling his bond back to the market.</description>

      <title>The 7 Obstacles to Agricultural Development</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/seven-obstacles/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/seven-obstacles/</guid>
      <description>In The Lectures on Jurisprudence, Adam Smith enumerated the 7 obstacles to agriculture:
  Lack of cultivation by the big land owners
  Payment of the rent in kind
  The farmer has less produce to pay as rent after a bad harvest, but he will have a bit more money to pay because the scarcity will increase the money price of his little harvest.
 Additional taxes by the government (kings)</description>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/last-capitalist/</guid>
      <description>In a previous post , we mentioned that our model designated 2019 as the start of the crisis years which will be a general economic downturn culminating as a global stagflation.
This period will be a time for mentality change specifically with thecapitalist system which is really just the perfection of the old mercantile system. Capitalism &amp;lsquo;arbitrages&amp;rsquo; equity while mercantilism &amp;lsquo;arbitrages&amp;rsquo; commodities.
First, Some History.. The mercantile system was created when paper money and paper instruments were invented by the Dutch in the 17th century, who got the idea from the Jews.</description>

      <title>Land Reform Principles of Adam Smith</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/land-reform/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/land-reform/</guid>
      <description>In Book 3, Chap 2, Adam Smith writes that people should own land only as they can productively use:
A great proprietor is seldom a great improver. In the disorderly times which created those barbarous institutions, the great proprietor was employed in defending his own territories and extending his jurisdiction over his neighbours. He did not have time to cultivate and improve the land. When law and order was established and afforded him this leisure, he often did not have the inclination nor the needed abilities.</description>

      <title>What Defines Capitalism?</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/capitalism/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/capitalism/</guid>
      <description>Summary: We define Capitalism as an economic system that uses outside ownership to amass private profits.
 A major topic of debate among economists is whether Adam Smith was a proponent of capitalism.
We argue that he was not, simply because his core ideas are very different from those of capitalism, which is merely mercantilism with superficial changes. The source of the confusion is the unclear definition of the word &amp;lsquo;capitalism&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>The Skyscraper Curse of Economics</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/skyscraper-curse/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/skyscraper-curse/</guid>
      <description>The Economist showed an interesting graphic of the correlation of skyscrapers and economic crises in a phenomenon known as the Skyscraper Curse. A question was posed: &amp;ldquo;Does this frenzy of building augur badly for the world economy?&amp;rdquo;, to which we answer &amp;ldquo;Yes, because of Economics&amp;rdquo;.
To explain why skyscraper booms are generally bad, we explain their nature using our Dialectical method, or by finding out the metaphysical causes to physical economic effects, as used by David Hume and Adam Smith.</description>

      <description>The differences in the economic philosophies of different time periods can be attributed to the main ideas or mentalities prevalent during those times, as the effect of new experiences or &amp;lsquo;impressions&amp;rsquo; on the mind. We chronologically list the main events that may have caused people to have those new experiences from which they developed new ideas.

      <title>7 Barter Disadvantages Addressed</title>

      <description>The following are the common disadvantages of barter:
1. Lack of Double Coincidence of Wants Persons must have matching requirements for barter to work
Our Response
This is only true for bilateral barter or trade involving two persons. Smith&amp;rsquo;s system is multilateral wherein trade is circular and not direct.
The following workmen are necessary to make the shears used to clip the wool to make the coat: The miner, builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, The feller of the timber, The burner of the charcoal used in the smelting-house, The brick-maker and the brick-layer, The workers who attend the furnace The mill-wright, forger, and smith.</description>

      <title>Adam Smith would be against Brexit</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/brexit-adam-smith/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/brexit-adam-smith/</guid>
      <description>Adam Smith would be against Brexit because the European Union (EU) is an internal free trade zone and Britain derives a lot of benefits from it.
However, this does not mean that Smith would be pro-EU. This is because while there is free trade within it, there are oppressive regulations and subsidies that make it hard for outsiders and outside trade to penetrate fortress Europe.
Rather, Smith would be for a World Union (WU) where all countries have free trade and immigration with each other.</description>

      <title>Adam Smith&#39;s Mistakes in the Wealth of Nations</title>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/adam-smith-mistake/</guid>
      <description>Adam Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations as an attack on Mercantilism which has since evolved into Neoclassical Economics. Despite his attack, it&amp;rsquo;s very strange for him to entrust an entire country&amp;rsquo;s external trade to foreign merchants:
If the society has insufficient capital to cultivate all its lands and to completely process all its rude produce, there is even a big advantage that its rude produce should be exported by a foreign capital.</description>

      <title>Import Substitution versus Export Promotion</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/import-substitution-vs-export-promotion/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/import-substitution-vs-export-promotion/</guid>
      <description>Import substitution is an economic policy that replaces imports with local manufactures. It was popularized by Argentina in the 1970&amp;rsquo;s and subsequently spread around the world. Its main goal is to lower a country’s expenses.
Adam Smith would categorize it as a policy by poor and austere societies:
In every civilized society which has the distinction of ranks, there were always two systems of morality: the strict or austere which is generally admired and revered by the common people, and the liberal or loose system which is commonly adopted by people of fashion.</description>

      <title>The 3 Kinds of Trades</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/three-kinds-of-trade/</link>

      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/three-kinds-of-trade/</guid>
      <description>Adam Smith gave three kinds of trades:
1. Local or Home Trade This is the trade done within a nation&amp;rsquo;s borders. This generally supports the most people. Ancient and Medieval China was able to sustain itself with local trade alone.
2. Direct Foreign Trade 3. Indirect or Roundabout Foreign Trade Of course, no country can do everything by itself, that’s why Smith wrote:
The most round-about foreign trade of consumption therefore may be as necessary as the most direct foreign trade in terms of supporting the productive labour of the country and the value of its produce.</description>

      <description>The science of resource allocation began with Xenophon&amp;rsquo;s The Economist which narrates how Socrates was taught about proper estate management.
Socrates cites Cyrus the Great of Persia as the first person during that period to get Economics right by having policies that encouraged the productivity of the empire.
In the West, this knowledge was carried over from the Persians to the Greeks and then to the Romans.
Asia, on the other hand, had its Economics founded in Hinduism which predates the Persian empire.</description>

      <title>What is Inflation and Deflation?</title>
      <link>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/inflation-deflation/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://superphysics.org/social/economics/inflation-deflation/</guid>
      <description>Our previous post on The Four Laws of Value explained the metaphysics of value and why Pantrynomic&amp;rsquo;s goal is zero inflation.
Economics shallowly defines &amp;lsquo;inflation&amp;rsquo; as a rise in prices, and &amp;lsquo;deflation&amp;rsquo; as its decline. This definition obviously does not hold because Japan has been in deflation for a long time and yet its prices, such as rent and consumer prices, remain high.
What really &amp;lsquo;deflated&amp;rsquo; was economic activity, arising from Japan&amp;rsquo;s declining population.</description>
