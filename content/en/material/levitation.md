In a past post, we explained [Material Relativity for contact forces](/material/principles/material-relativity) by starting with an example of action at a distance, as levitation. This was to introduce the concept of metapyhsical Effort, as being different from the physical Force from Newton.  

Here, we explain Effort as implemented to create action-at-a-distance, something that is not known in Physics. This is  because Einstein cancelled the aether which facilitates it. 

In contrast, Superphysics enshrines the aether as the top or boss-layer of physical reality. 

This is still in line with Nature since Maxwell, Fresnell, Hertz, and Tesla all believed in the aether. It is therefore only Einstein who is out of touch with Nature. This in turn is why technology is so limited and humans still use Newtonian rockets (based on 17th century principles) to go to outer space.

## The Effort of Aether

We use the Stokes (Material) Aether to demonstrate action at a distance. 

We take a 1 kilogram object then apply a prolonged emission on it in order to reduce its weight by 1 gram. We then use this as the basis for a levitating object propelled by the aether.

This is where `G`, `g`, and the Kepler tensor will be necessary to change the state of an object in order to move it through spacetime or Descartes' aether without needing contact forces.  


## All 5 Layers Work Together to Create Physical Reality

In a nutshell, the aether used electromagnetism on a material object to change its location in spacetime. This manifests as movement which is recorded relatively by the weighing scale. 

This means that, logically, the ability to change and generate movement comes from the radioactive layer (weak force).  

Thus, the sequence of events is:

Sequence | Layer | Effect
--- | --- | ---
1 | Aether | The intention to move the mass
2 | Radiant (Electromagnetism) | The emission is created
3 | Material (Strong) | The emission hits the identity (object with mass)
4 | Radioactive (Weak) | This creates a change in the identity
5 | Spatial (Spacetime) | This moves the object

As you can see, all 5 layers are used to create the reality of the movement of the object. This then matches our principle that all physical movement and change involves all 5 layers, ultimately commanded by the aethereal layer.
