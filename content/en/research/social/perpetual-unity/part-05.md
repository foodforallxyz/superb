Article: Eligibility

Non-human living beings are entitled to non-human rights. 


Article : Conditional Right to Exist

Natural life is the commonly-perceived lifespan and behavior of a living entity. 

A living being or species has a right to exist as long as it, by its own nature, does not endanger the continued  existence of other living species.

A living being or species that, by its mere existence, endangers the survival or life-expression of other species does not have the right to exist.
