Based on resources and costs, the employment of a given volume of labour by an entrepreneur involves him in two kinds of expense:

1. His payments for the factors of production (exclusive of other entrepreneurs) for their current services, which we shall call the factor cost of the employment in question

2. His payments to other entrepreneurs for purchases

<!-- what he has to purchase from them together with the sacrifice which he incurs by employing the equipment instead of leaving it idle, which we shall call  -->
The "user cost" is the cost of using his own equipment.

`Output - factor cost = profit or entrepreneur's income`

The factor cost is the income of the factors of production. Thus:

`total income = factor cost + profit`

The total income is the result of the employment given by the entrepreneur. 

The entrepreneur’s profit is the quantity which he endeavours to maximise when he is deciding what amount, of employment to offer. 

<!-- It is sometimes convenient, when we are looking at it from the entrepreneur’s standpoint, to call the --> 

Aggregate income (i.e. factor cost plus profit) is the proceeds from a given amount of employment. 

On the other hand, the aggregate supply price of the output of a given amount of employment is the expectation of proceeds which will just make it worth the while of the entrepreneurs to give that employment.[3] 

It follows that resources and factor cost per unit of employment, the amount of employment, both in each individual firm and industry and in the aggregate, depends on the amount of the proceeds which the entrepreneurs expect to receive from the corresponding output.

Entrepreneurs will endeavour to fix the amount of employment at the level which they expect to maximise the excess of the proceeds over the factor cost. 

Let:

- `Z` is the aggregate supply price of the output from employing `N` men
- the relationship between `Z` and `N`  is `Z = φ(N)` which is the Aggregate Supply Function.[5] 
- `D`  is the proceeds which entrepreneurs expect from the employment of `N` men
- the relationship between `D` and `N` being written as `D = f(N)`. This is the Aggregate Demand Function

For every N, the expected proceeds are greater than the aggregate supply price, i.e. if `D` is greater than `Z`, there will be an incentive to entrepreneurs to increase employment beyond N and, if necessary, to raise costs by competing with one another for the factors of production, up to the value of N for which Z has become equal to D. 

Thus the volume of employment is given by the point of intersection between the aggregate demand function and the aggregate supply function; for it is at this point that the entrepreneurs’ expectation of profits will be maximised. The value of D at the point of the aggregate demand function, where it is intersected by the aggregate supply function, will be called the effective demand.

This is the substance of the General Theory of Employment. The succeeding chapters will examine the various factors on which these two functions depend. 


## The Classical Doctrine 

The classical doctrine used to be expressed as “Supply creates its own Demand.” It continues to underlie all orthodox economic theory, involves a special assumption as to the relationship between these two functions. 

“Supply creates its own Demand” means that:
- `f(N)` and `φ(N)` are equal for all values of N, i.e. for all levels of output and employment; and
- when there is an increase in `Z( = f(N))` corresponding to an increase in `N, D( =f(N))` necessarily increases by the same amount as Z.

The classical theory assumes that the aggregate demand price (or proceeds) always accommodates itself to the aggregate supply price. In this way, whatever the value of `N` may be, the proceeds `D` assume a value equal to the aggregate supply price Z which corresponds to `N`.

It means that:
- **effective demand, instead of having a unique equilibrium value, is an infinite range of values all equally admissible.**
- the amount of employment is indeterminate except in so far as the marginal disutility of labour sets an upper limit. 

This means that competition between entrepreneurs would always lead to an expansion of employment up to the point at which the supply of output as a whole ceases to be elastic, i.e. where a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be accompanied by any increase in output. 

This would be full employment. 

Chapter 2 gave a definition of full employment in terms of the behaviour of labour. 

An alternative, though equivalent, criterion is that at which we have now arrived, namely a situation, in which aggregate employment is inelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output. 

Thus Say’s law, that the aggregate demand price of output as a whole is equal to its aggregate supply price for all volumes of output, is equivalent to the proposition that there is no obstacle to full employment. 

If, however, this is not the true law relating the aggregate demand and supply functions, there is a vitally important chapter of economic theory which remains to be written and without which all discussions concerning the volume of aggregate employment are futile. 


<!-- A brief summary of the theory of employment to be worked out in the course of the following chapters may, perhaps, help the reader at this stage, even though it may not be fully intelligible. The terms involved will be more carefully defined in due course. In this summary  -->

We assume that the money-wage and other factor costs are constant per unit of labour employed. 

But this simplification is solely to facilitate the exposition. The essential character of the argument is precisely the same whether or not money-wages, etc., are liable to change.


## The General Theory 

When employment increases, aggregate real income is increased. This increases aggregate consumption, but not by so much as income. 

Hence, employers would make a loss if all of the increased employment were devoted to satisfying the increased demand for immediate consumption. 

### A high level of investment is needed to sustain the target employment

Thus, to justify any given amount of employment, the current investment must be enough to absorb the excess of total output over what the society chooses to consume when employment is at that given level. 

Unless this investment is there, the receipts of the entrepreneurs will be less than what is needed to induce them to offer the given amount of employment.

The amount of current investment dictates:
- the society's propensity to consume
- the equilibrium level of employment (the employment level wherein employers do not expand or contract employment)

The amount of current investment will depend, in turn, on "the inducement to invest". This inducement depends on the relation between:
- the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, and 
- the rates of interest on loans<!--  of various maturities and risks.  -->

Thus, given the propensity to consume and the rate of new investment, there will be only one level of employment consistent with equilibrium. This is because any other level will lead to inequality between:
- the aggregate supply price of output as a whole and
- its aggregate demand price

This level cannot be greater than full employment, i.e. the real wage cannot be less than the marginal disutility of labour. But there is no reason to expect it to be equal to full employment. 

### Exception 

The effective demand associated with full employment is a special case. It is only realised when the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest stand in a particular relationship to one another. This particular relationship corresponds to classical assumptions. It is in a sense an optimum relationship. 

But it can only exist when, by accident or design, current investment provides an amount of demand just equal to the excess of the aggregate supply price of the output resulting from full employment over what the community will choose to spend on consumption when it is fully employed.
