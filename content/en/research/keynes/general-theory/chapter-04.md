Chapters 4 to 7 are a digression on three perplexities:

1. The choice of the units of quantity for an economic system as a whole
2. The part played by expectation in economic analysis
3. The definition of income

The units of Economics are unsatisfactory becuase of 3 things:

<!-- . This is proven by the National Dividend which is the stock of real capital and the general price-level: -->


## 1. The National Dividend

This was defined by Marshall and Professor Pigou. It measures the **volume** of current output (real income) and not the **value** of output or money-income. 

Furthermore, it depends on **net output** which is the net addition to the resources of society available for:
- consumption or
- retention as capital stock

This net output is from the economic activities and sacrifices of the current period, after allowing for the wastage of  real capital at the start of the period. They did this to try to create a quantitative science. 

**But I seriously object to this because the society's output of goods and services is a non-homogeneous complex which cannot be measured** *.


> *Superphysics Note: This is the same essence as Ricardo's objection to Adam Smith using grains as the measure of value.



It can be measured only in special cases. For example, when all the items of one output are included in the same proportions in another output.


## 2. The Net Output

This is ever harder to calculate when we try to measure the net addition to capital equipment

In this, we must find some basis for a quantitative comparison between the new equipment and the old ones that perished by wastage.

To get the net National Dividend, Pigou deducts such "normal" obsolescence, etc. "Normal" is defined as that the depletion which can be foreseen regularly at least in the big picture.

But this deduction is not a deduction in terms of money. So he assumes that there can be a change in physical quantity, although there has been no physical change -- he is covertly introducing changes in value. 

Moreover, he is unable to devise any satisfactory formula[4] to evaluate new equipment against old when, due to changes in technique, the two are not identical. 

Pigou aimed at the right concept for economic analysis. But it needs a better system of units. Otherwise, its precise definition is impossible. 

Without a common unit, there is no solution to the problem of:
- comparing one real output with another
- calculating net output by setting off new items of equipment against the wastage of old items


## 3. The concept of general price-level is vague

<!-- This makes it very unsatisfactory for causal analysis, which ought to be exact. Nevertheless these difficulties are rightly regarded as --> This is a “purely theoretical” conundrum that they never perplexes business decisions. These are irrelevant to causal economic events which are clear-cut and determinate despite the quantitative indeterminacy of this concept.

Thus, general prices lack precision and are unnecessary. Our quantitative analysis must be expressed without using any quantitatively vague expressions. As soon as one tries, one can get on much better without them. 

Two incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot provide the material for a quantitative analysis. But this does not prevent us from making approximate statistical comparisons. These comparisons depend on some broad of judgment rather than strict calculation. <!-- , which may possess significance and validity within certain limits. --> 

Net real output and general price levels are in the field of history and statistics. They should satisfy historical or social curiosity. 


But they are not good for our causal analysis which requires perfect precision. 

<!--  — such as  , whether or not our knowledge of the actual values of the relevant quantities is complete or exact — is neither usual nor necessary.  -->

They say that net output today is greater, but the price-level lower than ten years ago. It is equal to saying that Queen Victoria was a better queen but not a happier woman than Queen Elizabeth. It is <!--  — a proposition not without meaning and not without interest, but  --> unsuitable for differential calculus. 

Our precision will be fake if we try to use such vague concepts in quantitative analysis. 



<!-- An entrepreneur is always concerned with decisions on 
- the scale on which to work a given capital equipment
- the expectation of an increased demand (i.e. a raising of the aggregate demand function) will lead to an increase in aggregate output -->

How are firms, which own the capital equipment, induced to generate more employment?<!--  associate with it a greater aggregate employment of labour.  -->

We can answer this for an individual firm or industry producing a homogeneous product through its changes in output. 

But when we aggregate all firms, we can only speak accurately for employment applied to a given equipment. Output as a whole and its price-level are not required here since there is no need for an absolute measure of current aggregate output. Such a measure would allow us to compare its amount with the amount from having different capital equipment with a different quantity of employment.


If we want to roughly compare an increase of output, we must rely on <!-- the general presumption that --> the amount of employment generated by a given capital equipment as a satisfactory index <!-- of the amount of resultant output -->. 

The two are presumed to be directly correlated, though not in exact numerical proportions. 

My theory of employment uses only two fundamental units of quantity:

1. Quantities of money-value - this is strictly homogeneous via wage-unit
2. Quantities of employment - this can be made homogeneous via labour-time as labour unit

The different grades and kinds of labour and salaried assistance have more or less a fixed relative remuneration. 

The quantity of employment can be defined by:
- using 1 hour of ordinary labour as the unit
- weighing 1 hour of special employment relative to the remuneration of the ordinary labour

In this way, 1 hour of special labour paid at 2x ordinary labor at 1 hour will count as two units. Thus:
- "labour-unit" is 1 hour of ordinary labour. 
- "wage-unit" is the money-wage of a labour-unit*.[5] 


> *Superphysics note: We rename labour unit into "hourly-common-labour" and wage unit as "hourly-common-wage". Keynes' use of wage-unit as the measure of value in an economy is the reason why minimum wage is established in countries

<!-- We shall call the unit in which the quantity of employment is measured the . -->

Thus, `E = NW`

- `E` is wages
- `W` is the hourly-common-wage
- `N` is the quantity of employment


<!-- This assumption of homogeneity in the supply of labour is not upset by the obvious fact of great differences in the specialised skill of individual workers and in their suitability for different occupations.  -->

If workers' pay is proportional to their efficiency, then their pay will show the amount of labour that they can supply. 

<!--  the differences are dealt with by our having regarded individuals as contributing to the supply of labour in proportion to their remuneration.  -->

## Going Beyond the Natural Capacity

As output increases, a firm's additional labour will add less productivity relative to the hourly-common-wage paid to it.

<!-- this is merely one factor among others leading to a diminishing return from the capital equipment in terms of output as more labour is employed on it.  -->

We subsume the non-homogeneity of equally paid work in the equipment. We regard it as less and less adapted to employ the available labour units as output increases. This is the opposite of regarding the available labour <!-- units --> as less and less adapted to use a homogeneous capital equipment. 

Thus, if all specialised are already utilized and common labour adds to <!--  or practised labour and the use of less suitable labour involves a higher --> a higher labour cost per unit of output, then the rate of return from the equipment becomes smaller faster as employment increases. <!--  is more rapid than it would be if there were such a surplus. -->[6] 

<!-- Even in the limiting case where different labour units were so highly specialised as to be altogether incapable of being substituted for one another for this merely means that the elasticity of supply of output from a particular type of capital equipment falls suddenly to zero when all the available labour specialised to its use is already employed.[7]  -->

Thus, our assumption of a homogeneous unit of labour is only problematic if there is great instability in the relative pay of different hourly-common-labour. This can be solved by supposing a rapid liability to change in the supply of labour and the shape of the aggregate supply function. 

Much unnecessary perplexity can be avoided if we limit ourselves strictly to the two units= hourly-common-wage and hourly-common-labour, when we are dealing with the behaviour of the economic system as a whole.

We only use units of particular outputs and equipment when we are analysing the output of individual firms or industries in isolation. 

The vague concepts are:
- the quantity of output as a whole
- the quantity of capital equipment as a whole
- the general price levels

We can use these when we are comparing historical data. <!-- comparison which is within certain limits avowedly unprecise and approximate. --> 

We shall measure the changes in current output as:
- the number of men employed on the existing capital equipment
- skilled workers being weighted according to the ordinary pay

<!--  (whether to satisfy consumers or to produce fresh capital equipment) --> 

We do not need a quantitative comparison between this output and the output from associating a different set of workers with a different capital equipment.

To predict how entrepreneurs <!-- possessing a given equipment --> will respond to a shift in the aggregate demand function, we do not need to know how the quantity of output* compares to:
- the standard of life
- the general level of prices

<!--  would compare with what they were at a different date or in another country.  -->

> *Superhysics note: This is actually why we created the [grain index](/social/economics/solutions/gdp)



The aggregate supply function, through the hourly-common-wage and hourly-common-labour, can handle the:
- conditions of supply <!-- such as are usually expressed in terms of the supply curve, and  -->
- elasticity of supply relating output to price

This does not need any reference to quantities of output, whether individually or as a whole. <!--  we are concerned with a particular firm or industry or with economic activity as a whole.  -->

The aggregate supply function for a firm (and an industry as a whole) is:

```elixir
Zr = φr(Nr)
```

- Nr is the target level of employment
- Zr is the return expected that will then induce Nr

<!-- If the relation between employment and output is such that an  -->

If employment Nr causes an output Or, where Or = ψr(Nr), it follows that p = Zr/Or = φr(Nr)/ψr(Nr) is the ordinary supply curve.

Thus, in the case of each homogeneous commodity, for which Or = ψr(Nr) has a definite meaning, we can evaluate Zr = ψr(Nr) in the ordinary way/ 

But we can then aggregate the Nr’s in a way which we cannot aggregate the Or’s, since ΣOr is not a numerical quantity. 

Moreover, if a given aggregate employment will be distributed in a unique way between different industries, so that Nr is a function of N, further simplifications are possible.

5. If X stands for any quantity measured in terms of money, it will often be convenient to write Xw for the same quantity measured in terms of the wage-unit. 

6. This is why the supply price of output rises with increasing demand even when there is still a surplus of equipment identical in type with the equipment in use. 

If we suppose that the surplus supply of labour forms a pool equally available to all entrepreneurs and that labour employed for a given purpose is rewarded, in part at least, per unit of effort and not with strict regard to its efficiency in its actual particular employment (which is in most cases the realistic assumption to make), the diminishing efficiency of the labour employed is an outstanding example of rising supply price with increasing output, not due to internal diseconomies. 

7. How the supply curve in ordinary use is supposed to deal with the above difficulty I cannot say, since those who use this curve have not made their assumptions very clear. Probably they are assuming that labour employed for a given purpose is always rewarded with strict regard to its efficiency for that purpose. But this is unrealistic. 

The varying efficiency of labour is due to equipment because the increasing surpluses, which emerge as output is increased, accrue in practice mainly to the owners of the equipment and not to the more efficient workers (though these may get an advantage through being employed more regularly and by receiving earlier promotion); 

Men of differing efficiency working at the same job are seldom paid at rates closely proportional to their efficiencies. Where, however, increased pay for higher efficiency occurs, and in so far as it occurs, my method takes account of it; since in calculating the number of labour units employed, the individual workers are weighted in proportion to their remuneration. 

On my assumptions, complications arise where we are dealing with particular supply curves, since their shape will depend on the demand for suitable labour in other directions. It would be unrealistic to ignore these complications. 

But we need not consider them when we are dealing with employment as a whole, provided we assume that a given volume of effective demand has a particular distribution of this demand between different products uniquely associated with it. It may be, however, that this would not hold good irrespective of the particular cause of the change in demand. E.g. an increase in effective demand due to an increased propensity to consume might find itself faced by a different aggregate supply function from that which would face an equal increase in demand due to an increased inducement to invest. All this, however, belongs to the detailed analysis of the general ideas here set forth, which it is no part of my immediate purpose to pursue.
