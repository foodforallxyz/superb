1. Resources and costs, income (both money-income and real income) depend on the volume of employment `N`

2. The relationship between the society's income and what it can spend on consumption `D1`, will depend on the society's propensity to consume.

Consumption depends on the level of aggregate income and, therefore, on the level of employment `N`, except when there is some change in the propensity to consume.

3. The amount of labour `N` which the entrepreneurs employ depends on demand as the sum `D` of `D1` and `D2`.

- `D1` is the amount which the community expects to spend on consumption
- `D2` is the amount which it can devote to new investment
- `D` is effective demand

4. `D1 + D2 = D = φ(N)`

- `φ` is the aggregate supply function

Item 2 shows that `D1` is a function of `N` which we may write `χ(N)`. Depending on the propensity to consume, it follows that `φ(N) - χ(N) = D2`

5. Hence the volume of employment in equilibrium depends on:

- the propensity to consume `χ` [this leads to demand]
- the volume of investment `D2` [this feeds the supply]
- the aggregate supply function `φ` [this feeds demand]

This is the essence of the General Theory of Employment. 

6. The real wage is determined by the marginal productivity of labour in the wage-goods industries for every value `N` [employment level]. 

Item 5 therefore is subject to the condition that `N` [employment level] cannot exceed the value which reduces the real wage to equality with the marginal disutility of labour.

This means that not all changes in `D` [demand] leads to constant money-waves. <!-- are compatible with our temporary assumption that money-wages are constant. Thus, --> <!--  it will be essential to a full statement of  --> <!-- our theory dispenses with this assumption.  -->

7. The classical theory believes that `D = φ(N)` [demand is equal to supply]. 

The volume of employment is in a neutral equilibrium for all the possible levels of employment `N` when this volume is less than its maximum value that the competition between entrepreneurs push it to this maximum value.

According to the classical theory, stable equilibrium can only be achieved at this point. 

8. When employment increases, `D1` [resulting demand] will increase, but not by so much as `D` [effective demand]. 

This is because when our income increases, our consumption increases also, but not so much. <!-- The key to our practical problem is to be found in this psychological law.  --> [more employment leads to more savings]

The more <!-- greater the volume of --> the employment, the more will be the gap between:
- the aggregate supply price (`Z`) <!-- of the corresponding output --> and 
- the sum (`D1`) [resulting demand] which entrepreneurs can expect to get back.<!--  out of the consumers' expenditure. --> 

Hence, if there is no change in the propensity to consume, employment cannot increase unless at the same time `D2` [investment] is increasing so as to fill the increasing gap between `Z` and `D1` [resulting demand].  <!-- [savings must go to new investments which will stimulate demand]  -->

The classical theory thinks <!-- has special assumptions --> that there is some force* which, when employment increases, always causes `D2` [investment] to increase enough to fill the widening gap between `Z` and `D1`. 

> *Superphysics Note: This is the absolute demand from Adam Smith, which is not present in Ricardo nor any other economist. This absolute demand is killed by profit maximization embodied in `D2`. Economic Superphysics aims to counteract profit maximization through barter. There is no mention of barter anywhere in Keynes' General Theory


The economic system might be in stable equilibrium with `N` [employment level] below full employment (the intersection of the aggregate demand with aggregate supply).

Thus, employment is not determined by the marginal disutility of labour measured in terms of real wages, except when the supply of labour available at a given real wage sets a maximum level to employment.

The volume of employment is determined by:
- the propensity to consume [demand] and
- the rate of new investment

The volume of employment is determined by <!-- uniquely related to a given --> the level of real wages, not the other way round.

If the propensity to consume and the rate of new investment result in a deficient effective demand, then:
- many people will be unemployed at the current real wage. 
- the equilibrium real wage will be greater than the marginal disutility of the equilibrium level of employment

<!-- the actual level of employment will fall short of the supply of labour potentially available at the existing real wage, and -->

This explains the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty. 

The shortage of effective demand often will:
- halt the increase of employment before a level of full employment has been reached.
- inhibit the process of production even if the marginal product of labour still exceeds the marginal disutility of employment in value. 

Moreover, the richer the society, the wider will be the gap* between its actual and its potential production [because the rich are not demanding more]. 
- This will lead to more obvious and outrageous defects of the economic system. 

> *Superphysics note: In Economic Superphysics, this is addressed by 2 state funds, an investment fund and a clearing fund. The investment fund is a mini sovereign wealth fund that funds investments in industries that create basic necessities. The clearing fund provides trade financing. These close the gap in effective demand and absorb idle money.


A poor society will be prone to consume more of its output [have high effective demand].
- This makes a very modest investment enough to provide full employment.

Whereas, a wealthy society will have to find better opportunities for investment* if the saving propensities of its wealthier members are to be compatible with the employment of its poorer members. 

> *Superphysics note: This is because profit and rent maximization is more acute in a wealthy society


If the inducement to invest is weak in a potentially wealthy society, then <!-- , in spite of its potential wealth, the working of the principle of --> the effective demand will be lower. 
- This will compel it to reduce its actual output until <!-- in spite of its potential wealth, --> it becomes so poor that its surplus over its consumption is reduced to match the weak inducement to invest*.


> *Superphysics Note: This weakness is caused by the doctrine of profit maximization


The marginal propensity to consume[6] will be weaker in a wealthy community. 
- But its accumulation of capital is larger. 

The opportunities for further investment are less attractive unless the interest rate falls* rapidly.
- This brings us to my theory of interest rates. 
- It explains why interest rates do not automatically fall to the appropriate level. Book 4 will discuss this. 

> *Superphysics Note: In Classical Economics, falling interest rates mean that profit rates are also falling. Keynes wrongly assumes that artificially low interest rates will drive investments. He fails to realize that investment has been corrupted by profit maximization which renders his solution impotent. The focus is only for Marginal Effciency of Capital 


Thus, 3 main gaps in our existing knowledge are:

1. The analysis of the Propensity to Consume
2. The definition of the Marginal Efficiency of Capital
3. The theory of the Rate of Interest*

> *Superphysics note: This is really the fallacy promoted by Keynesian doctrine


The Theory of Prices is subsidiary to our general theory. Money plays an essential part in our theory of the Rate of Interest. <!--  and we shall attempt to disentangle the peculiar characteristics of Money which distinguish it from other things.  -->


## Ricardo's Doctrine

Ricardo’s doctrine <!-- Ricardian economics --> fundamentally believes that:
- the aggregate demand function can be safely neglected
- it is impossible for effective demand to be deficient.

<!-- , which underlie what we have been taught for more than a century --> 

Malthus vehemently opposes this.
- But he was unable to explain clearly how and why effective demand could be deficient or excessive. 
- He failed to furnish an alternative. 

Ricardo totally conquered England as the Holy Inquisition conquered Spain. <!-- Not only was his theory accepted by the city, by statesmen and by the academic world.  -->

<!-- But controversy ceased; the other point of view completely disappeared; it ceased to be discussed.  -->

Malthus had wrestled the great puzzle of Effective Demand which vanished from economic literature. You will not find it in the works of:
- Marshall
- Edgeworth
- Pigou

These 3 formed the classical theory. 

Effective Demand only lived on furtively, below the surface, in the underworlds of:
- Karl Marx
- Silvio Gesell
- Major Douglas

<!-- The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery.  -->

<!-- It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected. That it -->

The Ricardian doctrine reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect. <!-- , added, I suppose, to its intellectual prestige. --> 
- Its teaching, translated into practice, was austere and often unpalatable. This lent it virtue. 
- It carried a vast and consistent logical superstructure, giving it beauty. 
- It could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress.
- It acquired authority from it saying that the attempt to change* such things will do more harm than good on the whole. 
- It justified the free activities of the individual capitalist, commended it to social forces. <!-- allowing it to  the support of the dominant social force behind authority.  -->

> *Superphysics Note: The failure of modern economies from the neoclassical changes done by Keynes is proof of the solidity of this Ricardian idea


But although the doctrine itself has remained unquestioned by orthodox economists up to a late date, its signal failure for purposes of scientific prediction has greatly impaired, in the course of time, the prestige of its practitioners.

The professional economists after Malthus were unmoved by the lack of correspondence between the results of their theory and actual facts. 

<!--  of observation;— a discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe, with the result of his growing unwillingness to accord to economists that measure of respect which he gives to other groups of scientists whose theoretical results are confirmed by observation when they are applied to the facts.  -->

<!-- , which has led to economists being looked upon as  -->

Candides <!-- left this world to  the cultivation of their gardens, --> teaches that all is for the best <!-- in the best of all possible worlds --> provided we will leave it alone. This then led to a celebrated optimism of traditional economic theory. This had led economists to neglect the drag on prosperity by a reduction of <!-- which can be exercised by an insufficiency of --> effective demand. 

A classical economy would natural tend towards the optimum employment of resources. But to assume* that it actually does so is to assume our difficulties away. <!--  in a Society which was functioning after the manner of the classical postulates. It may well be that the classical theory represents the way in which we should like our Economy to behave.  -->

> *Superphysics Note= The Classical system is supposed to make the lawmakers check against unnatural ideas such as profit maximization and too-big-to-fail, since these interfere with the natural corrective mechanisms. For some reason, this failed during the Marginal Revolution which was unchecked. This then led to the Depression. <br><br> So yes, it is the fault of Classical economics for not denouncing the Mmarginal Revolution and for not putting itself on a mathematical foundation. 




## Author’s Footnotes 

1. A precise definition of user cost will be given in Chapter 6

2. Not to be confused (vide infra) with the supply price of a unit of output in the ordinary sense of this term. 

3. The reader will observe that I am deducting the user cost both from the proceeds and from the aggregate supply price of a given volume of output, so that both these terms are to be interpreted net of user cost; whereas the aggregate sums paid by the purchasers are, of course, gross of user cost. 

The reasons why this is convenient will be given in Chapter 6. 

The essential point is that the aggregate proceeds and aggregate supply price net of user cost can be defined uniquely and unambiguously; whereas, since user cost is obviously dependent both on the degree of integration of industry and on the extent to which entrepreneurs buy from one another, there can be no definition of the aggregate sums paid by purchasers, inclusive of user cost, which is independent of these factors. 

There is a similar difficulty even in defining supply price in the ordinary sense for an individual producer; and in the case of the aggregate supply price of output as a whole serious difficulties of duplication are involved, which have not always been faced. If the term is to be interpreted gross of user cost, they can only be overcome by making special assumptions relating to the integration of entrepreneurs in groups according as they produce consumption-goods or capital-goods which are obscure and complicated in themselves and do not correspond to the facts. 

If, however, aggregate supply price is defined as above net of user cost, thew difficulties do not arise. The reader is advised, however, to await the fuller discussion in Chapter 6 and its appendix. 4. 

An entrepreneur, who has to reach a practical decision as to his scale of production, does not, of course, entertain a single undoubting expectation of what the sale-proceeds of a given output will be, but several hypothetical expectations held with varying degrees of probability and definiteness. 

By his expectation of proceeds I mean, therefore, that expectation of proceeds which, if it were held with certainty, would lead to the same behaviour as does the bundle of vague and more various possibilities which actually makes up his state of expectation when he reaches his decision. 

5. In Chapter 20 a function closely related to the above will be called the employment function. 6. Defined in Chapter 10, below.
