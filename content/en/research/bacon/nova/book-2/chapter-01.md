<!-- ON , OR THE REIGN OF MAN -->

{{< s v="1" >}} The aim of human power is to generate a new nature on a body. 

The aim of human knowledge is to discover the true form or difference of a given nature.

<!--  or the nature[71] to which such nature is owing, or source from which it emanates (for these terms approach nearest to an explanation of our meaning), is the labor and discovery of  -->

; and subordinate to these primary labors are two others of a secondary nature and inferior stamp. Under the first must be ranked the transformation of concrete bodies from one to another, which is possible within certain limits; under the second, the discovery, in every species of generation and motion, of the latent and uninterrupted process from the manifest efficient and manifest subject matter up to the given form: and a like discovery of the latent conformation of bodies which are at rest instead of being in motion.


{{< s v="2" >}} Shallow reasoning shows the unhappy state of man’s actual knowledge. 

True knowledge is the knowledge deduced from causes. The four causes are:
- matter
- form
- efficient
- end or final cause.

The latter is so far from being beneficial, that it even corrupts the sciences, except in the intercourse of man with man. 

The discovery of form is considered desperate. 

As for the efficient cause and matter (according to the present system of inquiry and the received opinions concerning them, by which they are placed remote from, and without any latent process toward form), they are but desultory and superficial, and of scarcely any avail to real and active knowledge. 

Nor are we unmindful of our having pointed out and corrected above the error of the human mind, in assigning the first qualities of essence to forms. 

<!-- Nothing exists in nature except  -->

The only existing things in nature are the individual bodies exhibiting clear individual effects according to particular laws. 
- Yet in each branch of learning, that very law, its investigation, discovery, and development, are the foundation both of theory and practice. 
- This law, therefore, and its parallel in each science, is what we understand by the term form,[75]. 

<!-- adopting that word because it has grown into common use, and is of familiar occurrence. -->


{{< s v="3" >}} He who has learned the cause of a particular nature (such as whiteness or heat), in particular subjects only, has acquired but an imperfect knowledge: as he who can induce a certain effect upon particular substances only, among those which are susceptible of it, has acquired but an imperfect power. 

But he who has only learned the efficient and material cause (which causes are variable and mere vehicles[111] conveying form to particular substances) may perhaps arrive at some new discoveries in matters of a similar nature, and prepared for the purpose, but does not stir the limits of things which are much more deeply rooted; while he who is acquainted with forms, comprehends the unity of nature in substances apparently most distinct from each other. 

He can disclose and bring forward, therefore (though it has never yet been done), things which neither the vicissitudes of nature, nor the industry of experiment, nor chance itself, would ever have brought about, and which would forever have escaped man’s thoughts; from the discovery of forms, therefore, results genuine theory and free practice.


{{< s v="4" >}}  Although there is a most intimate connection, and almost an identity between the ways of human power and human knowledge, yet, on account of the pernicious and inveterate habit of dwelling upon abstractions, it is by far the safest method to commence and build up the sciences from those foundations which bear a relation to the practical division, and to let them mark out and limit the theoretical. 

What precepts, or what direction or guide should a person would most desire in order to generate and superinduce any nature on a given body in the plainest language?

For instance, if a person should wish to superinduce the yellow color of gold on silver, or an additional weight (observing always the laws of matter) or transparency on an opaque stone, or tenacity in glass, or vegetation on a substance which is not vegetable, we must consider what species of precept or guide this person would prefer.

1. He will be anxious to be shown some method that will neither fail in effect, nor deceive him in the trial of it
2. He will be anxious that the prescribed method should not restrict him and tie him down to peculiar means, and certain particular methods of acting; for he will, perhaps, be at loss, and without the power or opportunity of collecting and procuring such means. 

Now if there be other means and methods (besides those prescribed) of creating such a nature, they will perhaps be of such a kind as are in his power, yet by the confined limits of the precept he will be deprived of reaping any advantage from them; thirdly, he will be anxious to be shown something not so difficult as the required effect itself, but approaching more nearly to practice.

We will lay this down, therefore, as the genuine and perfect rule of practice, that it should be certain, free and preparatory, or having relation to practice. 

this is the same thing as the discovery of a true form; for the form of any nature is such, that when it is assigned the particular nature infallibly follows. 

It is, therefore, always present when that nature is present, and universally attests such presence, and is inherent in the whole of it. The same form is of such a character, that if it be removed the particular nature infallibly vanishes. It is, therefore, absent, whenever that nature is absent, and perpetually testifies such absence, and exists in no other nature. Lastly, the true form is such, that it deduces the particular nature from some source of essence existing in many subjects, and more known (as they term it) to nature, than the form itself. Such, then, is our determination and rule with regard to a genuine and perfect theoretical axiom, that a nature be found convertible with a given nature, and yet such as to limit the more known nature, in the manner of a real genus. But these two rules, the practical and theoretical, are in fact the[113] same, and that which is most useful in practice is most correct in theory.
