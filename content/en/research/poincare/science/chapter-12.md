## Fresnel’s Theory

The best example that can be chosen
is the theory of light and its relations to the theory of elec-
tricity. 

The science of optics is more advanced than any other branch of physics because of Fresnel. 

The theory called the theory of undulations forms a complete whole. But we must not ask from it what it cannot give us. The object of mathematical theories is not to reveal to us the real nature
of things; that would be an unreasonable claim. 

Their only object is to co-ordinate the physical laws with which
physical experiment makes us acquainted, the enunciation of which, without the aid of mathematics, we should be unable to effect. Whether the ether exists or not mat-
ters little—let us leave that to the metaphysicians; what
is essential for us is, that everything happens as if it existed, and that this hypothesis is found to be suitable for the explanation of phenomena. After all, have we any
other reason for believing in the existence of material objects? That, too, is only a convenient hypothesis; only, it will never cease to be so, while some day, no doubt, the
ether will be thrown aside as useless.
But at the present moment the laws of optics, and
the equations which translate them into the language of
analysis, hold good—at least as a first approximation. It
will therefore be always useful to study a theory which
brings these equations into connection.

The undulatory theory is based on a molecular hypothesis; this is an advantage to those who think they can discover the cause under the law. But others find
in it a reason for distrust; and this distrust seems to
me as unfounded as the illusions of the former. These
hypotheses play but a secondary rôle. They may be sac-
rificed, and the sole reason why this is not generally done
is, that it would involve a certain loss of lucidity in the
explanation. In fact, if we look at it a little closer we
shall see that we borrow from molecular hypotheses but
two things—the principle of the conservation of energy,
and the linear form of the equations, which is the general
law of small movements as of all small variations. This
explains why most of the conclusions of Fresnel remain
unchanged when we adopt the electro-magnetic theory of
light.optics and electricity.
237
Maxwell’s Theory.—We all know that it was Maxwell
who connected by a slender tie two branches of physics—
optics and electricity—until then unsuspected of having
anything in common. Thus blended in a larger aggre-
gate, in a higher harmony, Fresnel’s theory of optics did
not perish. Parts of it are yet alive, and their mutual
relations are still the same. Only, the language which we
use to express them has changed; and, on the other hand,
Maxwell has revealed to us other relations, hitherto un-
suspected, between the different branches of optics and
the domain of electricity.
The first time a French reader opens Maxwell’s book,
his admiration is tempered with a feeling of uneasiness,
and often of distrust.
It is only after prolonged study, and at the cost of
much effort, that this feeling disappears. Some minds of
high calibre never lose this feeling. Why is it so difficult
for the ideas of this English scientist to become accli-
matised among us? No doubt the education received by
most enlightened Frenchmen predisposes them to appre-
ciate precision and logic more than any other qualities. In
this respect the old theories of mathematical physics gave
us complete satisfaction. All our masters, from Laplace
to Cauchy, proceeded along the same lines. Startingscience and hypothesis
238
with clearly enunciated hypotheses, they deduced from
them all their consequences with mathematical rigour,
and then compared them with experiment. It seemed to
be their aim to give to each of the branches of physics
the same precision as to celestial mechanics.
A mind accustomed to admire such models is not eas-
ily satisfied with a theory. Not only will it not tolerate
the least appearance of contradiction, but it will expect
the different parts to be logically connected with one an-
other, and will require the number of hypotheses to be
reduced to a minimum.
This is not all; there will be other demands which
appear to me to be less reasonable. Behind the mat-
ter of which our senses are aware, and which is made
known to us by experiment, such a thinker will expect to
see another kind of matter—the only true matter in its
opinion—which will no longer have anything but purely
geometrical qualities, and the atoms of which will be
mathematical points subject to the laws of dynamics
alone. And yet he will try to represent to himself, by an
unconscious contradiction, these invisible and colourless
atoms, and therefore to bring them as close as possible
to ordinary matter.
Then only will he be thoroughly satisfied, and he willoptics and electricity.
239
then imagine that he has penetrated the secret of the
universe. Even if the satisfaction is fallacious, it is none
the less difficult to give it up. Thus, on opening the pages
of Maxwell, a Frenchman expects to find a theoretical
whole, as logical and as precise as the physical optics that
is founded on the hypothesis of the ether. He is thus
preparing for himself a disappointment which I should
like the reader to avoid; so I will warn him at once of
what he will find and what he will not find in Maxwell.
Maxwell does not give a mechanical explanation of
electricity and magnetism; he confines himself to show-
ing that such an explanation is possible. He shows that
the phenomena of optics are only a particular case of
electro-magnetic phenomena. From the whole theory of
electricity a theory of light can be immediately deduced.
Unfortunately the converse is not true; it is not always
easy to find a complete explanation of electrical phenom-
ena. In particular it is not easy if we take as our starting-
point Fresnel’s theory; to do so, no doubt, would be im-
possible; but none the less we must ask ourselves if we
are compelled to surrender admirable results which we
thought we had definitively acquired. That seems a step
backwards, and many sound intellects will not willingly
allow of this.science and hypothesis
240
Should the reader consent to set some bounds to
his hopes, he will still come across other difficulties.
The English scientist does not try to erect a unique,
definitive, and well-arranged building; he seems to raise
rather a large number of provisional and independent
constructions, between which communication is diffi-
cult and sometimes impossible. Take, for instance, the
chapter in which electro-static attractions are explained
by the pressures and tensions of the dielectric medium.
This chapter might be suppressed without the rest of the
book being thereby less clear or less complete, and yet it
contains a theory which is self-sufficient, and which can
be understood without reading a word of what precedes
or follows. But it is not only independent of the rest of
the book; it is difficult to reconcile it with the fundamen-
tal ideas of the volume. Maxwell does not even attempt
to reconcile it; he merely says: “I have not been able to
make the next step—namely, to account by mechanical
considerations for these stresses in the dielectric.”
This example will be sufficient to show what I mean;
I could quote many others. Thus, who would suspect
on reading the pages devoted to magnetic rotatory po-
larisation that there is an identity between optical and
magnetic phenomena?optics and electricity.
241
We must not flatter ourselves that we have avoided
every contradiction, but we ought to make up our minds.
Two contradictory theories, provided that they are kept
from overlapping, and that we do not look to find in
them the explanation of things, may, in fact, be very
useful instruments of research; and perhaps the reading
of Maxwell would be less suggestive if he had not opened
up to us so many new and divergent ways. But the fun-
damental idea is masked, as it were. So far is this the
case, that in most works that are popularised, this idea
is the only point which is left completely untouched. To
show the importance of this, I think I ought to explain in
what this fundamental idea consists; but for that purpose
a short digression is necessary.
The Mechanical Explanation of Physical Phenom-
ena.—In every physical phenomenon there is a certain
number of parameters which are reached directly by ex-
periment, and which can be measured. I shall call them
the parameters q. Observation next teaches us the laws
of the variations of these parameters, and these laws
can be generally stated in the form of differential equa-
tions which connect together the parameters q and time.
What can be done to give a mechanical interpretation
to such a phenomenon? We may endeavour to explainscience and hypothesis
242
it, either by the movements of ordinary matter, or by
those of one or more hypothetical fluids. These fluids
will be considered as formed of a very large number of
isolated molecules m. When may we say that we have
a complete mechanical explanation of the phenomenon?
It will be, on the one hand, when we know the differen-
tial equations which are satisfied by the co-ordinates of
these hypothetical molecules m, equations which must,
in addition, conform to the laws of dynamics; and, on
the other hand, when we know the relations which define
the co-ordinates of the molecules m as functions of the
parameters q, attainable by experiment. These equa-
tions, as I have said, should conform to the principles
of dynamics, and, in particular, to the principle of the
conservation of energy, and to that of least action.
The first of these two principles teaches us that the
total energy is constant, and may be divided into two
parts:—
(1) Kinetic energy, or vis viva, which depends on the
masses of the hypothetical molecules m, and on their
velocities. This I shall call T. (2) The potential en-
ergy which depends only on the co-ordinates of these
molecules, and this I shall call U. It is the sum of the
energies T and U that is constant.optics and electricity.
243
Now what are we taught by the principle of least ac-
tion? It teaches us that to pass from the initial position
occupied at the instant t 0 to the final position occupied at
the instant t 1 , the system must describe such a path that
in the interval of time between the instant t 0 and t 1 , the
mean value of the action—i.e., the difference between the
two energies T and U, must be as small as possible. The
first of these two principles is, moreover, a consequence
of the second. If we know the functions T and U, this
second principle is sufficient to determine the equations
of motion.
Among the paths which enable us to pass from one po-
sition to another, there is clearly one for which the mean
value of the action is smaller than for all the others. In
addition, there is only one such path; and it follows from
this, that the principle of least action is sufficient to de-
termine the path followed, and therefore the equations of
motion. We thus obtain what are called the equations of
Lagrange. In these equations the independent variables
are the co-ordinates of the hypothetical molecules m; but
I now assume that we take for the variables the parame-
ters q, which are directly accessible to experiment.
The two parts of the energy should then be expressed
as a function of the parameters q and their derivatives;science and hypothesis
244
it is clear that it is under this form that they will appear
to the experimenter. The latter will naturally endeavour
to define kinetic and potential energy by the aid of quan-
tities he can directly observe. 1 If this be granted, the
system will always proceed from one position to another
by such a path that the mean value of the action is a min-
imum. It matters little that T and U are now expressed
by the aid of the parameters q and their derivatives; it
matters little that it is also by the aid of these param-
eters that we define the initial and final positions; the
principle of least action will always remain true.
Now here again, of the whole of the paths which lead
from one position to another, there is one and only one
for which the mean action is a minimum. The principle
of least action is therefore sufficient for the determination
of the differential equations which define the variations
of the parameters q. The equations thus obtained are
another form of Lagrange’s equations.
To form these equations we need not know the re-
lations which connect the parameters q with the co-
1
We may add that U will depend only on the q parameters,
that T will depend on them and their derivatives with respect to
time, and will be a homogeneous polynomial of the second degree
with respect to these derivatives.optics and electricity.
245
ordinates of the hypothetical molecules, nor the masses
of the molecules, nor the expression of U as a function
of the co-ordinates of these molecules. All we need know
is the expression of U as a function of the parameters q,
and that of T as a function of the parameters q and
their derivatives—i.e., the expressions of the kinetic and
potential energy in terms of experimental data.
One of two things must now happen. Either for a
convenient choice of T and U the Lagrangian equations,
constructed as we have indicated, will be identical with
the differential equations deduced from experiment, or
there will be no functions T and U for which this identity
takes place. In the latter case it is clear that no mechan-
ical explanation is possible. The necessary condition for
a mechanical explanation to be possible is therefore this:
that we may choose the functions T and U so as to sat-
isfy the principle of least action, and of the conservation
of energy. Besides, this condition is sufficient. Suppose,
in fact, that we have found a function U of the parame-
ters q, which represents one of the parts of energy, and
that the part of the energy which we represent by T is a
function of the parameters q and their derivatives; that
it is a polynomial of the second degree with respect to
its derivatives, and finally that the Lagrangian equationsscience and hypothesis
246
formed by the aid of these two functions T and U are
in conformity with the data of the experiment. How can
we deduce from this a mechanical explanation? U must
be regarded as the potential energy of a system of which
T is the kinetic energy. There is no difficulty as far as
U is concerned, but can T be regarded as the vis viva of
a material system?
It is easily shown that this is always possible, and
in an unlimited number of ways. I will be content with
referring the reader to the pages of the preface of my
Électricité et Optique for further details. Thus, if the
principle of least action cannot be satisfied, no mechan-
ical explanation is possible; if it can be satisfied, there
is not only one explanation, but an unlimited number,
whence it follows that since there is one there must be
an unlimited number.
One more remark. Among the quantities that may
be reached by experiment directly we shall consider some
as the co-ordinates of our hypothetical molecules, some
will be our parameters q, and the rest will be regarded
as dependent not only on the co-ordinates but on the
velocities—or what comes to the same thing, we look on
them as derivatives of the parameters q, or as combina-
tions of these parameters and their derivatives.optics and electricity.
247
Here then a question occurs: among all these quan-
tities measured experimentally which shall we choose to
represent the parameters q? and which shall we prefer
to regard as the derivatives of these parameters? This
choice remains arbitrary to a large extent, but a mechan-
ical explanation will be possible if it is done so as to
satisfy the principle of least action.
Next, Maxwell asks: Can this choice and that of the
two energies T and U be made so that electric phenom-
ena will satisfy this principle? Experiment shows us
that the energy of an electro-magnetic field decomposes
into electro-static and electro-dynamic energy. Maxwell
recognised that if we regard the former as the poten-
tial energy U, and the latter as the kinetic energy T,
and that if on the other hand we take the electro-static
charges of the conductors as the parameters q, and the
intensity of the currents as derivatives of other parame-
ters q—under these conditions, Maxwell has recognised
that electric phenomena satisfy the principle of least ac-
tion. He was then certain of a mechanical explanation.
If he had expounded this theory at the beginning of his
first volume, instead of relegating it to a corner of the
second, it would not have escaped the attention of most
readers. If therefore a phenomenon allows of a completescience and hypothesis
248
mechanical explanation, it allows of an unlimited num-
ber of others, which will equally take into account all the
particulars revealed by experiment. And this is confirmed
by the history of every branch of physics. In Optics, for
instance, Fresnel believed vibration to be perpendicular
to the plane of polarisation; Neumann holds that it is
parallel to that plane. For a long time an experimentum
crucis was sought for, which would enable us to decide
between these two theories, but in vain. In the same way,
without going out of the domain of electricity, we find
that the theory of two fluids and the single fluid theory
equally account in a satisfactory manner for all the laws
of electro-statics. All these facts are easily explained,
thanks to the properties of the Lagrange equations.
It is easy now to understand Maxwell’s fundamental
idea. To demonstrate the possibility of a mechanical ex-
planation of electricity we need not trouble to find the
explanation itself; we need only know the expression of
the two functions T and U, which are the two parts of
energy, and to form with these two functions Lagrange’s
equations, and then to compare these equations with the
experimental laws.
How shall we choose from all the possible explana-
tions one in which the help of experiment will be want-optics and electricity.
249
ing? The day will perhaps come when physicists will no
longer concern themselves with questions which are inac-
cessible to positive methods, and will leave them to the
metaphysicians. That day has not yet come; man does
not so easily resign himself to remaining for ever ignorant
of the causes of things. Our choice cannot be therefore
any longer guided by considerations in which personal
appreciation plays too large a part. There are, however,
solutions which all will reject because of their fantastic
nature, and others which all will prefer because of their
simplicity. As far as magnetism and electricity are con-
cerned, Maxwell abstained from making any choice. It is
not that he has a systematic contempt for all that posi-
tive methods cannot reach, as may be seen from the time
he has devoted to the kinetic theory of gases. I may
add that if in his magnum opus he develops no complete
explanation, he has attempted one in an article in the
Philosophical Magazine. The strangeness and the com-
plexity of the hypotheses he found himself compelled to
make, led him afterwards to withdraw it.
The same spirit is found throughout his whole work.
He throws into relief the essential—i.e., what is common
to all theories; everything that suits only a particular the-
ory is passed over almost in silence. The reader therefore  finds himself in the presence of form nearly devoid of matter, which at first he is tempted to take as a fugi-
tive and unassailable phantom. But the efforts he is thus
compelled to make force him to think, and eventually he
sees that there is often something rather artificial in the
theoretical “aggregates” which he once admired.
