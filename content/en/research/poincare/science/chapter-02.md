Continuum cannot be explained by geometry. The geometer always seeks to represent shapes. But these  are only instruments to him. He uses space in his geometry just as he uses chalk.

Too much importance must not be attached to accidents which are often nothing more than the whiteness of the chalk.

The pure analyst has not to dread this pitfall. He has disengaged mathematics from all extraneous elements, and he is in a position to answer our question:—“Tell
me exactly what this continuum is, about which mathematicians reason.” 

Many analysts who reflect on their art have already done so—M. Tannery, for instance, in his Introduction à la théorie des Fonctions d’une variable.

Let us start with the integers. Between any two consecutive sets, intercalate one or more intermediary sets, and then between these sets others again, and so on indefinitely. 

We thus get an unlimited number of terms,

and these will be the numbers which we call fractional,
rational, or commensurable. But this is not yet all; be-mathematical magnitude.

tween these terms, which, be it marked, are already in-
finite in number, other terms are intercalated, and these
are called irrational or incommensurable.

Before going any further, let me make a preliminary remark. The continuum thus conceived is no longer a collection of individuals arranged in a certain order, infinite in number, it is true, but external the one to the other.

This is not the ordinary conception in which it is supposed that between the elements of the continuum exists an intimate connection making of it one whole, in which the point has no existence previous to the line, but the line does exist previous to the point. 

Multiplicity alone subsists, unity has disappeared—“the continuum is unity in multiplicity,” according to the celebrated formula. 

The analysts have even less reason to define their continuum as they do, since it is always on this that they reason when they are particularly proud of their rigour. It is
enough to warn the reader that the real mathematical
continuum is quite different from that of the physicists
and from that of the metaphysicians.

The mathematicians who are contented with this definition are the dupes of words, that the nature of each of these sets should be precisely indicated, that it should be explained how theyscience and hypothesis are to be intercalated, and that it should be shown how it
is possible to do it.

This, however, would be wrong; the only property of the sets which comes into the reasoning
is that of preceding or succeeding these or those other sets; this alone should therefore intervene in the definition. 

So we need not concern ourselves with the manner in which the sets are intercalated, and no one will doubt the possibility of the operation if he only remembers that “possible” in the language of geometers simply means exempt from contradiction. But our definition is not yet complete, and we come back to it after this rather long digression.

Definition of Incommensurables

The mathematicians of the Berlin school, and Kronecker in particular, have devoted themselves to constructing this continuous scale of irrational and fractional numbers without using
any other materials than the integer. 

The mathematical continuum from this point of view would be a pure creation of the mind in which experiment would have no part.

The idea of rational number not seeming to present
to them any difficulty, they have confined their attention
mainly to defining incommensurable numbers. But before reproducing their definition here, I must make anmathematical magnitude.

observation that will allay the astonishment which this
will not fail to provoke in readers who are but little fa-
miliar with the habits of geometers.

Mathematicians do not study objects, but the relations between objects; to them it is a matter of indifference if these objects are replaced by others, provided
that the relations do not change. Matter does not engage
their attention, they are interested by form alone.
If we did not remember it, we could hardly under-
stand that Kronecker gives the name of incommensurable
number to a simple symbol—that is to say, something
very different from the idea we think we ought to have
of a quantity which should be measurable and almost
tangible.

### Kronecker’s definition. 

Commensurable numbers may be divided into classes in an infinite number of ways, subject to the condition that any number whatever of the first class is greater than any number of the second. 

It may happen that among the numbers of the first class there is one which is smaller
than all the rest; if, for instance, we arrange in the first
class all the numbers greater than 2, and 2 itself, and
in the second class all the numbers smaller than 2, it is
clear that 2 will be the smallest of all the numbers of thescience and hypothesis

first class. The number 2 may therefore be chosen as the
symbol of this division.

It may happen, on the contrary, that in the second class there is one which is greater than all the rest. This is what takes place, for example, if the first class comprises
all the numbers greater than 2, and if, in the second, are
all the numbers less than 2, and 2 itself. 

Here again the number 2 might be chosen as the symbol of this division.
But it may equally well happen that we can find nei-
ther in the first class a number smaller than all the rest,
nor in the second class a number greater than all the
rest. 

Suppose, for instance, we place in the first class all the numbers whose squares are greater than 2, and in the second all the numbers whose squares are smaller
than 2. 

We know that in neither of them is a number whose square is equal to 2. Evidently there will be in
the first class no number which is smaller than all the
rest, for however near the square of a number may be
to 2, we can always find a commensurable whose square
is still nearer to 2. From Kronecker’s
point of view, the
√
incommensurable number 2 is nothing but the symbol
of this particular method of division of commensurable
numbers; and to each mode of repartition corresponds in
this way a number, commensurable or not, which servesmathematical magnitude.

as a symbol. But to be satisfied with this would be to for-
get the origin of these symbols; it remains to explain how
we have been led to attribute to them a kind of concrete
existence, and on the other hand, does not the difficulty
begin with fractions? 

Should we have the notion of these numbers if we did not previously know a matter which
we conceive as infinitely divisible—i.e., as a continuum?
The Physical Continuum.—We are next led to ask if
the idea of the mathematical continuum is not simply
drawn from experiment. 

If that be so, the rough data of experiment, which are our sensations, could be measured.
We might, indeed, be tempted to believe that this is so,
for in recent times there has been an attempt to measure them, and a law has even been formulated, known as Fechner’s law, according to which sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus. 

But if we examine the experiments by which the endeavour has been made to establish this law, we shall be led to a diametrically opposite conclusion. It has, for instance, been observed that
a weight A of 10 grammes and a weight B of 11 grammes
produced identical sensations, that the weight B could no
longer be distinguished from a weight C of 12 grammes,
but that the weight A was readily distinguished from the
weight C. 

Thus the rough results of the experiments mayscience and hypothesis be expressed by the following relations
A = B,
B = C,
A < C,
which may be regarded as the formula of the physical
continuum. But here is an intolerable disagreement with
the law of contradiction, and the necessity of banishing
this disagreement has compelled us to invent the mathe-
matical continuum. We are therefore forced to conclude
that this notion has been created entirely by the mind,
but it is experiment that has provided the opportunity.
We cannot believe that two quantities which are equal to
a third are not equal to one another, and we are thus led
to suppose that A is different from B, and B from C, and
that if we have not been aware of this, it is due to the
imperfections of our senses.

The Creation of the Mathematical Continuum: First Stage.—

So far it would suffice, in order to account for
facts, to intercalate between A and B a small number of
terms which would remain discrete. What happens now
if we have recourse to some instrument to make up for
the weakness of our senses? If, for example, we use a
microscope? Such terms as A and B, which before were
indistinguishable from one another, appear now to be dis-
tinct: but between A and B, which are distinct, is inter-mathematical magnitude.

calated another new term D, which we can distinguish
neither from A nor from B. Although we may use the
most delicate methods, the rough results of our experi-
ments will always present the characters of the physical
continuum with the contradiction which is inherent in it.
We only escape from it by incessantly intercalating new
terms between the terms already distinguished, and this
operation must be pursued indefinitely. We might con-
ceive that it would be possible to stop if we could imagine
an instrument powerful enough to decompose the physi-
cal continuum into discrete elements, just as the telescope
resolves the Milky Way into stars. But this we cannot
imagine; it is always with our senses that we use our in-
struments; it is with the eye that we observe the image
magnified by the microscope, and this image must there-
fore always retain the characters of visual sensation, and
therefore those of the physical continuum.
Nothing distinguishes a length directly observed
from half that length doubled by the microscope. The
whole is homogeneous to the part; and there is a fresh
contradiction—or rather there would be one if the num-
ber of the terms were supposed to be finite; it is clear
that the part containing less terms than the whole cannot
be similar to the whole. The contradiction ceases as soonscience and hypothesis

as the number of terms is regarded as infinite. There is
nothing, for example, to prevent us from regarding the
aggregate of integers as similar to the aggregate of even
numbers, which is however only a part of it; in fact, to
each integer corresponds another even number which is
its double. But it is not only to escape this contradiction
contained in the empiric data that the mind is led to
create the concept of a continuum formed of an indefinite
number of terms.

Here everything takes place just as in the series of the
integers. We have the faculty of conceiving that a unit
may be added to a collection of units. 

Thanks to experiment, we have had the opportunity of exercising this
faculty and are conscious of it; but from this fact we feel
that our power is unlimited, and that we can count indef-
initely, although we have never had to count more than a
finite number of objects. In the same way, as soon as we
have intercalated terms between two consecutive terms
of a series, we feel that this operation may be continued
without limit, and that, so to speak, there is no intrinsic
reason for stopping. As an abbreviation, I may give the
name of a mathematical continuum of the first order to
every aggregate of terms formed after the same law as
the scale of commensurable numbers. If, then, we inter-mathematical magnitude.

calate new sets according to the laws of incommensurable
numbers, we obtain what may be called a continuum of
the second order.


Second Stage

We have only taken our first step. We have explained the origin of continuums of the first order;
we must now see why this is not sufficient, and why the
incommensurable numbers had to be invented.

If we try to imagine a line, it must have the characters of the physical continuum—that is to say, our representation must have a certain breadth. Two lines will therefore appear to us under the form of two narrow bands, and if we are content with this rough image, it is clear that
where two lines cross they must have some common part.

But the pure geometer makes one further effort; without entirely renouncing the aid of his senses, he tries to imagine a line without breadth and a point without size. This
he can do only by imagining a line as the limit towards
which tends a band that is growing thinner and thinner,
and the point as the limit towards which is tending an
area that is growing smaller and smaller. Our two bands,
however narrow they may be, will always have a common
area; the smaller they are the smaller it will be, and its
limit is what the geometer calls a point. This is why it is
said that the two lines which cross must have a commonscience and hypothesis

point, and this truth seems intuitive.
But a contradiction would be implied if we conceived
of lines as continuums of the first order—i.e., the lines
traced by the geometer should only give us points, the
co-ordinates of which are rational numbers. The con-
tradiction would be manifest if we were, for instance, to
assert the existence of lines and circles. It is clear, in fact,
that if the points whose co-ordinates are commensurable
were alone regarded as real, the in-circle of a square and
the diagonal of the square would not intersect, since the
co-ordinates of the point of intersection are incommensurable.

Even then we should have only certain incommensu-
rable numbers, and not all these numbers.
But let us imagine a line divided into two half-rays
(demi-droites). Each of these half-rays will appear to
our minds as a band of a certain breadth; these bands
will fit close together, because there must be no interval
between them. The common part will appear to us to be
a point which will still remain as we imagine the bands
to become thinner and thinner, so that we admit as an
intuitive truth that if a line be divided into two half-rays
the common frontier of these half-rays is a point. Here
we recognise the conception of Kronecker, in which anmathematical magnitude.

incommensurable number was regarded as the common
frontier of two classes of rational numbers. Such is the
origin of the continuum of the second order, which is the
mathematical continuum properly so called.
Summary.—To sum up, the mind has the faculty of
creating symbols, and it is thus that it has constructed
the mathematical continuum, which is only a particular
system of symbols. The only limit to its power is the
necessity of avoiding all contradiction; but the mind only
makes use of it when experiment gives a reason for it.
In the case with which we are concerned, the reason
is given by the idea of the physical continuum, drawn
from the rough data of the senses. But this idea leads
to a series of contradictions from each of which in turn
we must be freed. In this way we are forced to imagine
a more and more complicated system of symbols. That
on which we shall dwell is not merely exempt from in-
ternal contradiction,—it was so already at all the steps
we have taken,—but it is no longer in contradiction with
the various propositions which are called intuitive, and
which are derived from more or less elaborate empirical
notions.
Measurable Magnitude.—So far we have not spoken
of the measure of magnitudes; we can tell if any one ofscience and hypothesis

them is greater than any other, but we cannot say that
it is two or three times as large.

So far, I have only considered the order in which the terms are arranged; but that is not sufficient for most applications. 

We must learn how to compare the interval which separates any two terms. On this condition alone
will the continuum become measurable, and the operations of arithmetic be applicable. This can only be done by the aid of a new and special convention; and this convention is, that in such a case the interval between the terms A and B is equal to the interval which separates
C and D. For instance, we started with the integers, and
between two consecutive sets we intercalated n interme-
diary sets; by convention we now assume these new sets
to be equidistant. This is one of the ways of defining the
addition of two magnitudes; for if the interval AB is by
definition equal to the interval CD, the interval AD will
by definition be the sum of the intervals AB and AC.
This definition is very largely, but not altogether, arbi-
trary. It must satisfy certain conditions—the commuta-
tive and associative laws of addition, for instance; but,
provided the definition we choose satisfies these laws, the
choice is indifferent, and we need not state it precisely.

Remarks

We are now in a position to discuss severalmathematical magnitude.

important questions.
(1) Is the creative power of the mind exhausted by the
creation of the mathematical continuum? The answer
is in the negative, and this is shown in a very striking
manner by the work of Du Bois Reymond.

We know that mathematicians distinguish between infinitesimals of different orders, and that infinitesimals
of the second order are infinitely small, not only abso-
lutely so, but also in relation to those of the first order.
It is not difficult to imagine infinitesimals of fractional
or even of irrational order, and here once more we find
the mathematical continuum which has been dealt with
in the preceding pages. Further, there are infinitesimals
which are infinitely small with reference to those of the
first order, and infinitely large with respect to the or-
der 1 + , however small  may be. 

Here, then, are new terms intercalated in our series; and if I may be permitted to revert to the terminology used in the preceding pages, a terminology which is very convenient, although
it has not been consecrated by usage, I shall say that we
have created a kind of continuum of the third order.
It is an easy matter to go further, but it is idle to do
so, for we would only be imagining symbols without any
possible application, and no one will dream of doing that.science and hypothesis

This continuum of the third order, to which we are led by the consideration of the different orders of infinitesimals, is in itself of but little use and hardly worth quoting.

Geometers look on it as a mere curiosity. The mind only uses its creative faculty when experiment requires it. 
(2) When we are once in possession of the conception of the mathematical continuum, are we protected from contradictions analogous to those which gave it birth?

No, and the following is an instance:—

He is a savant indeed who will not take it as evident that every curve has a tangent; and, in fact, if we think of a curve and a straight line as two narrow bands, we can always arrange them in such a way that they have a common part without intersecting. 

Suppose now that the breadth of the bands diminishes indefinitely: the common part will still remain, and in the limit, so to speak, the two lines will have a common point, although they do not intersect—i.e., they will touch. 

The geometer who reasons in this way is only doing what we have done when we proved that two lines which intersect have a common point, and his intuition might also seem to be quite legitimate. 

But this is not the case. We can show that there are curves which have no tangent, if we
define such a curve as an analytical continuum of the sec-mathematical magnitude.

ond order. 

No doubt some artifice analogous to those we have discussed above would enable us to get rid of this
contradiction, but as the latter is only met with in very
exceptional cases, we need not trouble to do so. 

Instead of endeavouring to reconcile intuition and analysis, we are content to sacrifice one of them, and as analysis must be flawless, intuition must go to the wall.


##  The Physical Continuum of several Dimensions

We have discussed above the physical continuum as it is derived from the immediate evidence of our senses—or, if the reader prefers, from the rough results of Fechner’s experiments; I have shown that these results are summed up in the contradictory formulæ

A = B,
B = C,
A < C.

Let us now see how this notion is generalised, and how from it may be derived the concept of continuums of several dimensions. 

Consider any two aggregates of sensations. We can either distinguish between them, or
we cannot; just as in Fechner’s experiments the weight of 10 grammes could be distinguished from the weight of 12 grammes, but not from the weight of 11 grammes.

This is all that is required to construct the continuum of several dimensions.science and hypothesis

Let us call one of these aggregates of sensations an element. 

It will be in a measure analogous to the point of the mathematicians, but will not be, however, the same thing. We cannot say that our element has no size, for we cannot distinguish it from its immediate neighbours, and it is thus surrounded by a kind of fog. 

If the astronomical comparison may be allowed, our “elements” would be like nebulæ, whereas the mathematical points would be like stars.

If this be granted, a system of elements will form a
continuum, if we can pass from any one of them to any
other by a series of consecutive elements such that each
cannot be distinguished from its predecessor. This lin-
ear series is to the line of the mathematician what the
isolated element was to the point.

Before going further, I must explain what is meant by a cut. Let us consider a continuum C, and remove
from it certain of its elements, which for a moment we shall regard as no longer belonging to the continuum. We shall call the aggregate of elements thus removed a cut.

By means of this cut, the continuum C will be subdivided into several distinct continuums; the aggregate of elements which remain will cease to form a single continuum. There will then be on C two elements, A and B,mathematical magnitude.

which we must look upon as belonging to two distinct
continuums; and we see that this must be so, because it
will be impossible to find a linear series of consecutive elements of C (each of the elements indistinguishable from the preceding, the first being A and the last B), unless one of the elements of this series is indistinguishable from one of the elements of the cut.

It may happen, on the contrary, that the cut may not be sufficient to subdivide the continuum C. To classify the physical continuums, we must first of all ascertain the nature of the cuts which must be made in order to subdivide them. 

If a physical continuum, C, may be subdivided by a cut reducing to a finite number of elements,
all distinguishable the one from the other (and therefore forming neither one continuum nor several continuums), we shall call C a continuum of one dimension. 

If, on the contrary, C can only be subdivided by cuts which are themselves continuums, we shall say that C is of several dimensions; if the cuts are continuums of one dimension, then we shall say that C has two dimensions; if cuts of two dimensions are sufficient, we shall say that C is of three
dimensions, and so on. 

Thus the notion of the physical continuum of several dimensions is defined, thanks to the
very simple fact, that two aggregates of sensations may science and hypothesis

be distinguishable or indistinguishable.


## The Mathematical Continuum of Several Dimensions

The conception of the mathematical continuum of `n` dimensions may be led up to quite naturally by a
process similar to that which we discussed at the beginning of this chapter. A point of such a continuum is defined by a system of n distinct magnitudes which we call its co-ordinates.

The magnitudes need not always be measurable; there is, for instance, one branch of geometry independent of the measure of magnitudes, in which we are only concerned with knowing, for example, if, on a curve ABC, the point B is between the points A and C, and in which
it is immaterial whether the arc AB is equal to or twice
the arc BC. 

This branch is called Analysis Situs. It contains quite a large body of doctrine which has attracted
the attention of the greatest geometers, and from which
are derived, one from another, a whole series of remarkable theorems. What distinguishes these theorems from those of ordinary geometry is that they are purely qualitative. 

They are still true if the figures are copied by
an unskilful draughtsman, with the result that the proportions are distorted and the straight lines replaced by lines which are more or less curved.mathematical magnitude.

As soon as measurement is introduced into the continuum we have just defined, the continuum becomes space, and geometry is born. But the discussion of this is reserved for Part II.
