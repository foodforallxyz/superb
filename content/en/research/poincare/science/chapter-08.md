## Energetics

The difficulties raised by the classical mechanics have led certain minds to prefer a new system
which they call Energetics. 

Energetics took its rise in consequence of the discovery of the principle of the con-
servation of energy. Helmholtz gave it its definite form.
We begin by defining two quantities which play a fun-
damental part in this theory. 

They are kinetic energy, or vis viva, and potential energy. Every change that the bodies of nature can undergo is regulated by two experimental laws. 

First, the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is constant. This is the principle of the conservation of energy.

Second, if a system of bodies is at A at the time t 0 , and at B at the time t 1 , it always passes from the first position to the second by such a path that
the mean value of the difference between the two kinds
of energy in the interval of time which separates the two
epochs t 0 and t 1 is a minimum. This is Hamilton’s prin-
ciple, and is one of the forms of the principle of least
action. The energetic theory has the following advan-
tages over the classical. First, it is less incomplete—that
is to say, the principles of the conservation of energy andenergy and thermo-dynamics.

of Hamilton teach us more than the fundamental princi-
ples of the classical theory, and exclude certain motions
which do not occur in nature and which would be com-
patible with the classical theory. 

Second, it frees us from the hypothesis of atoms, which it was almost impossi-
ble to avoid with the classical theory. But in its turn it
raises fresh difficulties. The definitions of the two kinds
of energy would raise difficulties almost as great as those
of force and mass in the first system. However, we can
get out of these difficulties more easily, at any rate in
the simplest cases. Assume an isolated system formed of
a certain number of material points. Assume that these
points are acted upon by forces depending only on their
relative position and their distances apart, and indepen-
dent of their velocities. In virtue of the principle of the
conservation of energy there must be a function of forces.
In this simple case the enunciation of the principle of the
conservation of energy is of extreme simplicity. A cer-
tain quantity, which may be determined by experiment,
must remain constant. This quantity is the sum of two
terms. The first depends only on the position of the ma-
terial points, and is independent of their velocities; the
second is proportional to the squares of these velocities.
This decomposition can only take place in one way. Thescience and hypothesis
140
first of these terms, which I shall call U, will be potential
energy; the second, which I shall call T, will be kinetic
energy. It is true that if T + U is constant, so is any func-
tion of T + U, φ(T + U). But this function φ(T + U) will
not be the sum of two terms, the one independent of the
velocities, and the other proportional to the square of the
velocities. Among the functions which remain constant
there is only one which enjoys this property. It is T + U
(or a linear function of T + U, it matters not which, since
this linear function may always be reduced to T + U by
a change of unit and of origin). This, then, is what we
call energy. The first term we shall call potential energy,
and the second kinetic energy. The definition of the two
kinds of energy may therefore be carried through without
any ambiguity.

So it is with the definition of mass. Kinetic energy, or
vis viva, is expressed very simply by the aid of the masses,
and of the relative velocities of all the material points
with reference to one of them. These relative velocities
may be observed, and when we have the expression of
the kinetic energy as a function of these relative veloc-
ities, the co-efficients of this expression will give us the
masses. So in this simple case the fundamental ideas can
be defined without difficulty. But the difficulties reap-energy and thermo-dynamics.

pear in the more complicated cases if the forces, instead
of depending solely on the distances, depend also on the
velocities. For example, Weber supposes the mutual ac-
tion of two electric molecules to depend not only on their
distance but on their velocity and on their acceleration.
If material points attracted each other according to an
analogous law, U would depend on the velocity, and it
might contain a term proportional to the square of the
velocity. How can we detect among such terms those that
arise from T or U? and how, therefore, can we distinguish
the two parts of the energy? But there is more than this.
How can we define energy itself? We have no more rea-
son to take as our definition T + U rather than any other
function of T+U, when the property which characterised
T + U has disappeared—namely, that of being the sum
of two terms of a particular form. But that is not all. We
must take account, not only of mechanical energy prop-
erly so called, but of the other forms of energy—heat,
chemical energy, electrical energy, etc. The principle of
the conservation of energy must be written T+U+Q = a
constant, where T is the sensible kinetic energy, U the po-
tential energy of position, depending only on the position
of the bodies, Q the internal molecular energy under the
thermal, chemical, or electrical form. This would be allscience and hypothesis
142
right if the three terms were absolutely distinct; if T were
proportional to the square of the velocities, U indepen-
dent of these velocities and of the state of the bodies,
Q independent of the velocities and of the positions of
the bodies, and depending only on their internal state.
The expression for the energy could be decomposed in one
way only into three terms of this form. But this is not
the case. Let us consider electrified bodies. The electro-
static energy due to their mutual action will evidently
depend on their charge—i.e., on their state; but it will
equally depend on their position. If these bodies are in
motion, they will act electro-dynamically on one another,
and the electro-dynamic energy will depend not only on
their state and their position but on their velocities. We
have therefore no means of making the selection of the
terms which should form part of T, and U, and Q, and
of separating the three parts of the energy. If T + U + Q
is constant, the same is true of any function whatever,
φ(T + U + Q).
If T + U + Q were of the particular form that I have
suggested above, no ambiguity would ensue. Among the
functions φ(T + U + Q) which remain constant, there is
only one that would be of this particular form, namely the
one which I would agree to call energy. But I have saidenergy and thermo-dynamics.
143
this is not rigorously the case. Among the functions that
remain constant there is not one which can rigorously be
placed in this particular form. How then can we choose
from among them that which should be called energy?
We have no longer any guide in our choice.
Of the principle of the conservation of energy there
is nothing left then but an enunciation:—There is some-
thing which remains constant. In this form it, in its turn,
is outside the bounds of experiment and reduced to a kind
of tautology. It is clear that if the world is governed by
laws there will be quantities which remain constant. Like
Newton’s laws, and for an analogous reason, the principle
of the conservation of energy being based on experiment,
can no longer be invalidated by it.
This discussion shows that, in passing from the clas-
sical system to the energetic, an advance has been made;
but it shows, at the same time, that we have not advanced
far enough.
Another objection seems to be still more serious. The
principle of least action is applicable to reversible phe-
nomena, but it is by no means satisfactory as far as irre-
versible phenomena are concerned. Helmholtz attempted
to extend it to this class of phenomena, but he did not
and could not succeed. So far as this is concerned allscience and hypothesis

has yet to be done. The very enunciation of the princi-
ple of least action is objectionable. To move from one
point to another, a material molecule, acted upon by no
force, but compelled to move on a surface, will take as
its path the geodesic line—i.e., the shortest path. This
molecule seems to know the point to which we want to
take it, to foresee the time that it will take it to reach
it by such a path, and then to know how to choose the
most convenient path. The enunciation of the principle
presents it to us, so to speak, as a living and free entity.
It is clear that it would be better to replace it by a less
objectionable enunciation, one in which, as philosophers
would say, final effects do not seem to be substituted for
acting causes.

Thermo-dynamics.—The rôle of the two fundamental
principles of thermo-dynamics becomes daily more im-
portant in all branches of natural philosophy. Abandon-
ing the ambitious theories of forty years ago, encumbered
as they were with molecular hypotheses, we now try to
rest on thermo-dynamics alone the entire edifice of math-
ematical physics. Will the two principles of Mayer and
of Clausius assure to it foundations solid enough to last
for some time? We all feel it, but whence does our con-
fidence arise? An eminent physicist said to me one day,energy and thermo-dynamics.

àpropos of the law of errors:—every one stoutly believes
it, because mathematicians imagine that it is an effect
of observation, and observers imagine that it is a math-
ematical theorem. And this was for a long time the case
with the principle of the conservation of energy. It is no
longer the same now. There is no one who does not know
that it is an experimental fact. But then who gives us the
right of attributing to the principle itself more generality
and more precision than to the experiments which have
served to demonstrate it? This is asking, if it is legiti-
mate to generalise, as we do every day, empiric data, and
I shall not be so foolhardy as to discuss this question,
after so many philosophers have vainly tried to solve it.
One thing alone is certain. If this permission were re-
fused to us, science could not exist; or at least would be
reduced to a kind of inventory, to the ascertaining of iso-
lated facts. It would not longer be to us of any value,
since it could not satisfy our need of order and harmony,
and because it would be at the same time incapable of
prediction. As the circumstances which have preceded
any fact whatever will never again, in all probability, be
simultaneously reproduced, we already require a first gen-
eralisation to predict whether the fact will be renewed
as soon as the least of these circumstances is changed.science and hypothesis

But every proposition may be generalised in an infinite
number of ways. Among all possible generalisations we
must choose, and we cannot but choose the simplest. We
are therefore led to adopt the same course as if a simple
law were, other things being equal, more probable than
a complex law. A century ago it was frankly confessed
and proclaimed abroad that Nature loves simplicity; but
Nature has proved the contrary since then on more than
one occasion. We no longer confess this tendency, and we
only keep of it what is indispensable, so that science may
not become impossible. In formulating a general, simple,
and formal law, based on a comparatively small number
of not altogether consistent experiments, we have only
obeyed a necessity from which the human mind cannot
free itself. But there is something more, and that is why
I dwell on this topic. No one doubts that Mayer’s prin-
ciple is not called upon to survive all the particular laws
from which it was deduced, in the same way that New-
ton’s law has survived the laws of Kepler from which it
was derived, and which are no longer anything but ap-
proximations, if we take perturbations into account. Now
why does this principle thus occupy a kind of privileged
position among physical laws? There are many reasons
for that. At the outset we think that we cannot rejectenergy and thermo-dynamics.

it, or even doubt its absolute rigour, without admitting
the possibility of perpetual motion; we certainly feel dis-
trust at such a prospect, and we believe ourselves less
rash in affirming it than in denying it. That perhaps is
not quite accurate. The impossibility of perpetual mo-
tion only implies the conservation of energy for reversible
phenomena. The imposing simplicity of Mayer’s principle
equally contributes to strengthen our faith. In a law im-
mediately deduced from experiments, such as Mariotte’s
law, this simplicity would rather appear to us a reason
for distrust; but here this is no longer the case. We take
elements which at the first glance are unconnected; these
arrange themselves in an unexpected order, and form a
harmonious whole. We cannot believe that this unex-
pected harmony is a mere result of chance. Our conquest
appears to be valuable to us in proportion to the efforts it
has cost, and we feel the more certain of having snatched
its true secret from Nature in proportion as Nature has
appeared more jealous of our attempts to discover it. But
these are only small reasons. Before we raise Mayer’s law
to the dignity of an absolute principle, a deeper discus-
sion is necessary. But if we embark on this discussion we
see that this absolute principle is not even easy to enun-
ciate. In every particular case we clearly see what energyscience and hypothesis

is, and we can give it at least a provisory definition; but
it is impossible to find a general definition of it. If we
wish to enunciate the principle in all its generality and
apply it to the universe, we see it vanish, so to speak,
and nothing is left but this—there is something which
remains constant. But has this a meaning? In the deter-
minist hypothesis the state of the universe is determined
by an extremely large number n of parameters, which I
shall call x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , , x n . As soon as we know at a
given moment the values of these n parameters, we also
know their derivatives with respect to time, and we can
therefore calculate the values of these same parameters
at an anterior or ulterior moment. In other words, these
n parameters specify n differential equations of the first
order. These equations have n−1 integrals, and therefore
there are n − 1 functions of x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , . . . , x n , which re-
main constant. If we say then, there is something which
remains constant, we are only enunciating a tautology.
We would be even embarrassed to decide which among
all our integrals is that which should retain the name of
energy. Besides, it is not in this sense that Mayer’s prin-
ciple is understood when it is applied to a limited system.
We admit, then, that p of our n parameters vary inde-
pendently so that we have only n − p relations, generallyenergy and thermo-dynamics.

linear, between our n parameters and their derivatives.
Suppose, for the sake of simplicity, that the sum of the
work done by the external forces is zero, as well as that
of all the quantities of heat given off from the interior:
what will then be the meaning of our principle? There is
a combination of these n − p relations, of which the first
member is an exact differential ; and then this differential
vanishing in virtue of our n − p relations, its integral is a
constant, and it is this integral which we call energy. But
how can it be that there are several parameters whose
variations are independent? That can only take place in
the case of external forces (although we have supposed,
for the sake of simplicity, that the algebraical sum of all
the work done by these forces has vanished). If, in fact,
the system were completely isolated from all external ac-
tion, the values of our n parameters at a given moment
would suffice to determine the state of the system at any
ulterior moment whatever, provided that we still clung to
the determinist hypothesis. We should therefore fall back
on the same difficulty as before. If the future state of the
system is not entirely determined by its present state, it
is because it further depends on the state of bodies ex-
ternal to the system. But then, is it likely that there
exist among the parameters x which define the state ofscience and hypothesis

the system of equations independent of this state of the
external bodies? and if in certain cases we think we can
find them, is it not only because of our ignorance, and
because the influence of these bodies is too weak for our
experiment to be able to detect it? If the system is not
regarded as completely isolated, it is probable that the
rigorously exact expression of its internal energy will de-
pend upon the state of the external bodies. Again, I have
supposed above that the sum of all the external work is
zero, and if we wish to be free from this rather artificial
restriction the enunciation becomes still more difficult.
To formulate Mayer’s principle by giving it an absolute
meaning, we must extend it to the whole universe, and
then we find ourselves face to face with the very diffi-
culty we have endeavoured to avoid. To sum up, and
to use ordinary language, the law of the conservation of
energy can have only one significance, because there is
in it a property common to all possible properties; but
in the determinist hypothesis there is only one possible,
and then the law has no meaning. In the indeterminist
hypothesis, on the other hand, it would have a meaning
even if we wished to regard it in an absolute sense. It
would appear as a limitation imposed on freedom.
But this word warns me that I am wandering from theenergy and thermo-dynamics.

subject, and that I am leaving the domain of mathemat-
ics and physics. I check myself, therefore, and I wish to
retain only one impression of the whole of this discussion,
and that is, that Mayer’s law is a form subtle enough for
us to be able to put into it almost anything we like. I
do not mean by that that it corresponds to no objective
reality, nor that it is reduced to mere tautology; since, in
each particular case, and provided we do not wish to ex-
tend it to the absolute, it has a perfectly clear meaning.
This subtlety is a reason for believing that it will last
long; and as, on the other hand, it will only disappear to
be blended in a higher harmony, we may work with con-
fidence and utilise it, certain beforehand that our work
will not be lost.

Almost everything that I have just said applies to the
principle of Clausius. What distinguishes it is, that it is
expressed by an inequality. It will be said perhaps that it
is the same with all physical laws, since their precision is
always limited by errors of observation. But they at least
claim to be first approximations, and we hope to replace
them little by little by more exact laws. If, on the other
hand, the principle of Clausius reduces to an inequality,
this is not caused by the imperfection of our means of
observation, but by the very nature of the question.science and hypothesis

General Conclusions on Part 3

The principles of mechanics are therefore presented to us under two different aspects. On the one hand, there are truths founded on experiment, and verified approximately as far as al-
most isolated systems are concerned; on the other hand, there are postulates applicable to the whole of the universe and regarded as rigorously true. 

If these postulates possess a generality and a certainty which falsify the experimental truths from which they were deduced, it is because they reduce in final analysis to a simple convention that we have a right to make, because we are certain beforehand that no experiment can contradict it. 

This convention, however, is not absolutely arbitrary; it is not the child of our caprice. We admit it because certain experiments have shown us that it will be convenient, and
thus is explained how experiment has built up the prin-
ciples of mechanics, and why, moreover, it cannot reverse
them. 

Take a comparison with geometry. The fundamental propositions of geometry, for instance, Euclid’s postulate, are only conventions, and it is quite as unrea-
sonable to ask if they are true or false as to ask if the
metric system is true or false. Only, these conventions
are convenient, and there are certain experiments which
prove it to us. At the first glance, the analogy is com-energy and thermo-dynamics.
153
plete, the rôle of experiment seems the same. 

We shall therefore be tempted to say, either mechanics must be looked upon as experimental science and then it should be the same with geometry; or, on the contrary, geometry is a deductive science, and then we can say the same of mechanics. Such a conclusion would be illegitimate.

The experiments which have led us to adopt as more convenient the fundamental conventions of geometry refer to bodies which have nothing in common with those that are studied by geometry. They refer to the properties of solid bodies and to the propagation of light in a straight line. These are mechanical, optical experiments. 

In no way can they be regarded as geometrical experiments. And even the probable reason why our geometry seems convenient to us is, that our bodies, our hands, and our limbs enjoy the properties of solid bodies. 

Our fundamental experiments are pre-eminently physiological experiments which refer, not to the space which is the object that geometry must study, but to our body—that is to say, to the instrument which we use for that study. 

On the other hand, the fundamental conventions of mechanics and the experiments which prove to us that they are convenient, certainly refer to the same objects or to analogous objects. Conventional and general principlesscience and hypothesis.

are the natural and direct generalisations of experimental and particular principles. Let it not be said that I am thus tracing artificial frontiers between the sciences;
that I am separating by a barrier geometry properly so
called from the study of solid bodies. 

I might just as well raise a barrier between experimental mechanics and the
conventional mechanics of general principles. Who does
not see, in fact, that by separating these two sciences we
mutilate both, and that what will remain of the conventional mechanics when it is isolated will be but very little,
and can in no way be compared with that grand body of
doctrine which is called geometry.

We now understand why the teaching of mechanics should remain experimental. Thus only can we be made
to understand the genesis of the science, and that is indispensable for a complete knowledge of the science itself. 

Besides, if we study mechanics, it is in order to apply it; and we can only apply it if it remains objective. Now, as we have seen, when principles gain in generality and certainty they lose in objectivity. It is therefore especially with the objective side of principles that we must
be early familiarised, and this can only be by passing from the particular to the general, instead of from the general to the particular.energy and thermo-dynamics.

Principles are conventions and definitions in disguise.

They are, however, deduced from experimental laws, and these laws have, so to speak, been erected into principles to which our mind attributes an absolute value.

Some philosophers have generalised far too much. They have thought that the principles were the whole of science, and therefore that the whole of science was conventional. This paradoxical doctrine, which is called Nominalism, cannot stand examination. How can a law become a principle? 

It expressed a relation between two real terms, A and B; but it was not rigorously true, it
was only approximate. We introduce arbitrarily an intermediate term, C, more or less imaginary, and C is by definition that which has with A exactly the relation expressed by the law. So our law is decomposed into an absolute and rigorous principle which expresses the relation of A to C, and an approximate experimental and revisable law which expresses the relation of C to B. But
it is clear that however far this decomposition may be
carried, laws will always remain. We shall now enter into
the domain of laws properly so called.
