## Significance of Physical Theories

The ephemeral nature of scientific theories takes by surprise the man of the world. 

Their brief period of prosperity ended, he sees them abandoned one after another; he sees ruins piled upon ruins; he predicts that the theories in fashion to-day will in a short time succumb in their turn, and he concludes that they are absolutely in vain. This is what he calls the bankruptcy of science.

His scepticism is superficial; he does not take into account the object of scientific theories and the part they
play, or he would understand that the ruins may be still good for something. No theory seemed established on
firmer ground than Fresnel’s, which attributed light to the movements of the ether. Then if Maxwell’s theory
is to-day preferred, does that mean that Fresnel’s work was in vain? No; for Fresnel’s object was not to know
whether there really is an ether, if it is or is not formed of atoms, if these atoms really move in this way or that;
his object was to predict optical phenomena.

This Fresnel’s theory enables us to do to-day as well as it did before Maxwell’s time. The differential equa-the theories of modern physics.

tions are always true, they may be always integrated
by the same methods, and the results of this integration still preserve their value. It cannot be said that this
is reducing physical theories to simple practical recipes;
these equations express relations, and if the equations
remain true, it is because the relations preserve their reality. 

They teach us now, as they did then, that there is such and such a relation between this thing and that;
only, the something which we then called motion, we now
call electric current. But these are merely names of the
images we substituted for the real objects which Nature
will hide for ever from our eyes. 

The true relations between these real objects are the only reality we can attain,
and the sole condition is that the same relations shall ex-
ist between these objects as between the images we are
forced to put in their place. If the relations are known
to us, what does it matter if we think it convenient to
replace one image by another?

That a given periodic phenomenon (an electric oscillation, for instance) is really due to the vibration of a
given atom, which, behaving like a pendulum, is really
displaced in this manner or that, all this is neither certain
nor essential. But that there is between the electric oscillation, the movement of the pendulum, and all periodic phenomena an intimate relationship which corresponds
to a profound reality; that this relationship, this similar-
ity, or rather this parallelism, is continued in the details;
that it is a consequence of more general principles such
as that of the conservation of energy, and that of least
action; this we may affirm; this is the truth which will
ever remain the same in whatever garb we may see fit to
clothe it.

Many theories of dispersion have been proposed. The
first were imperfect, and contained but little truth. Then
came that of Helmholtz, and this in its turn was modified
in different ways; its author himself conceived another
theory, founded on Maxwell’s principles. But the re-
markable thing is, that all the scientists who followed
Helmholtz obtain the same equations, although their
starting-points were to all appearance widely separated.
I venture to say that these theories are all simultaneously
true; not merely because they express a true relation—
that between absorption and abnormal dispersion. In
the premisses of these theories the part that is true is
the part common to all: it is the affirmation of this or
that relation between certain things, which some call by
one name and some by another.

The kinetic theory of gases has given rise to many objections, to which it would be difficult to find an answer
were it claimed that the theory is absolutely true. But all
these objections do not alter the fact that it has been use-
ful, particularly in revealing to us one true relation which
would otherwise have remained profoundly hidden—the
relation between gaseous and osmotic pressures. In this
sense, then, it may be said to be true.
When a physicist finds a contradiction between two
theories which are equally dear to him, he sometimes
says: “Let us not be troubled, but let us hold fast to the
two ends of the chain, lest we lose the intermediate links.”
This argument of the embarrassed theologian would be
ridiculous if we were to attribute to physical theories the
interpretation given them by the man of the world. In
case of contradiction one of them at least should be con-
sidered false. But this is no longer the case if we only
seek in them what should be sought. It is quite possi-
ble that they both express true relations, and that the
contradictions only exist in the images we have formed
to ourselves of reality. To those who feel that we are go-
ing too far in our limitations of the domain accessible to
the scientist, I reply: These questions which we forbid
you to investigate, and which you so regret, are not only
insoluble, they are illusory and devoid of meaning.science and hypothesis
182
Such a philosopher claims that all physics can be ex-
plained by the mutual impact of atoms. If he simply
means that the same relations obtain between physical
phenomena as between the mutual impact of a large num-
ber of billiard balls—well and good! this is verifiable,
and perhaps is true. But he means something more, and
we think we understand him, because we think we know
what an impact is. Why? Simply because we have of-
ten watched a game of billiards. Are we to understand
that God experiences the same sensations in the contem-
plation of His work that we do in watching a game of
billiards? If it is not our intention to give his assertion
this fantastic meaning, and if we do not wish to give it the
more restricted meaning I have already mentioned, which
is the sound meaning, then it has no meaning at all. Hy-
potheses of this kind have therefore only a metaphorical
sense. The scientist should no more banish them than
a poet banishes metaphor; but he ought to know what
they are worth. They may be useful to give satisfaction
to the mind, and they will do no harm as long as they
are only indifferent hypotheses.
These considerations explain to us why certain theo-
ries, that were thought to be abandoned and definitively
condemned by experiment, are suddenly revived fromthe theories of modern physics.
183
their ashes and begin a new life. It is because they ex-
pressed true relations, and had not ceased to do so when
for some reason or other we felt it necessary to enunciate
the same relations in another language. Their life had
been latent, as it were.
Barely fifteen years ago, was there anything more
ridiculous, more quaintly old-fashioned, than the fluids
of Coulomb? And yet, here they are re-appearing un-
der the name of electrons. In what do these permanently
electrified molecules differ from the electric molecules of
Coulomb? It is true that in the electrons the electricity is
supported by a little, a very little matter; in other words,
they have mass. Yet Coulomb did not deny mass to his
fluids, or if he did, it was with reluctance. It would be
rash to affirm that the belief in electrons will not also
undergo an eclipse, but it was none the less curious to
note this unexpected renaissance.
But the most striking example is Carnot’s principle.
Carnot established it, starting from false hypotheses.
When it was found that heat was indestructible, and
may be converted into work, his ideas were completely
abandoned; later, Clausius returned to them, and to him
is due their definitive triumph. In its primitive form,
Carnot’s theory expressed in addition to true relations,science and hypothesis
184
other inexact relations, the débris of old ideas; but the
presence of the latter did not alter the reality of the
others. Clausius had only to separate them, just as one
lops off dead branches.
The result was the second fundamental law of thermo-
dynamics. The relations were always the same, although
they did not hold, at least to all appearance, between the
same objects. This was sufficient for the principle to re-
tain its value. Nor have the reasonings of Carnot perished
on this account; they were applied to an imperfect con-
ception of matter, but their form—i.e., the essential part
of them, remained correct. What I have just said throws
some light at the same time on the rôle of general princi-
ples, such as those of the principle of least action or of the
conservation of energy. These principles are of very great
value. They were obtained in the search for what there
was in common in the enunciation of numerous physical
laws; they thus represent the quintessence of innumer-
able observations. However, from their very generality
results a consequence to which I have called attention in
Chapter VIII.—namely, that they are no longer capable
of verification. As we cannot give a general definition of
energy, the principle of the conservation of energy simply
signifies that there is a something which remains con-the theories of modern physics.
185
stant. Whatever fresh notions of the world may be given
us by future experiments, we are certain beforehand that
there is something which remains constant, and which
may be called energy. Does this mean that the princi-
ple has no meaning and vanishes into a tautology? Not
at all. It means that the different things to which we
give the name of energy are connected by a true relation-
ship; it affirms between them a real relation. But then,
if this principle has a meaning, it may be false; it may
be that we have no right to extend indefinitely its appli-
cations, and yet it is certain beforehand to be verified in
the strict sense of the word. How, then, shall we know
when it has been extended as far as is legitimate? Simply
when it ceases to be useful to us—i.e., when we can no
longer use it to predict correctly new phenomena. We
shall be certain in such a case that the relation affirmed
is no longer real, for otherwise it would be fruitful; ex-
periment without directly contradicting a new extension
of the principle will nevertheless have condemned it.
Physics and Mechanism.—Most theorists have a
constant predilection for explanations borrowed from
physics, mechanics, or dynamics. Some would be sat-
isfied if they could account for all phenomena by the
motion of molecules attracting one another accordingscience and hypothesis
186
to certain laws. Others are more exact: they would
suppress attractions acting at a distance; their molecules
would follow rectilinear paths, from which they would
only be deviated by impacts. Others again, such as
Hertz, suppress the forces as well, but suppose their
molecules subjected to geometrical connections analo-
gous, for instance, to those of articulated systems; thus,
they wish to reduce dynamics to a kind of kinematics. In
a word, they all wish to bend nature into a certain form,
and unless they can do this they cannot be satisfied. Is
Nature flexible enough for this?
We shall examine this question in Chapter 12, àpro-
pos of Maxwell’s theory. 

Every time that the principles of least action and energy are satisfied, we shall see that not
only is there always a mechanical explanation possible,
but that there is an unlimited number of such explana-
tions. 

By means of a well-known theorem due to Königs, it may be shown that we can explain everything in an unlimited number of ways, by connections after the manner of Hertz, or, again, by central forces. 

No doubt it may be just as easily demonstrated that everything may be explained by simple impacts. For this, let us bear in mind
that it is not enough to be content with the ordinary matter of which we are aware by means of our senses, and the movements of which we observe directly. 

Ordinary matter is either composed of:
- atoms, or
  - The internal movements of these escape our senses
- one of those subtle fluids, called the ether
  - This has always played so important a rôle in physical theories.

<!-- able to estimate only the displacement of the whole; or we may imagine  -->


Often we regard the ether as the only <!-- primitive, or even as the only --> true matter. 

The more moderate consider ordinary matter to be condensed ether. There is nothing startling in this conception. 

But others only reduce its importance still further, and see in matter nothing more than the geometrical locus of singularities in
the ether. 

Lord Kelvin, for instance, holds what we call matter to be only the locus of those points at which the ether is animated by vortex motions. 

Riemann believes it to be locus of those points at which ether is constantly destroyed. 

Wiechert or Larmor believes that it is the locus of the points at which the ether has undergone a kind of torsion of a very particular kind. 

But why do we apply the mechanical properties of ordinary matter, which is but false matter, to the ether?

The ancient fluids, caloric,
electricity, etc., were abandoned when it was seen that heat is not indestructible. 

But they were also laid aside for another reason, In materialising them, their individ-
uality was, so to speak, emphasised—gaps were opened
between them; 

these gaps had to be filled in when the sentiment of the unity of Nature became stronger,
and when the intimate relations which connect all the
parts were perceived. 

In multiplying the fluids, not only did the ancient physicists create unnecessary entities, but
they destroyed real ties. 

It is not enough for a theory not to affirm false relations; it must not conceal true relations.

Does our ether actually exist? We know the origin of our belief in the ether. If light takes several years to reach
us from a distant star, it is no longer on the star, nor is
it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported,
so to speak, by some material agency.

The same idea may be expressed in a more mathematical and more abstract form. What we note are the
changes undergone by the material molecules. 

A photographic plate experiences the consequences of a phenomenon of which the incandescent
mass of a star was the scene several years before. 

Now, in ordinary mechanics, the state of the system under consid-
eration depends only on its state at the moment imme-the theories of modern physics.
189
diately preceding; the system therefore satisfies certain
differential equations. On the other hand, if we did not
believe in the ether, the state of the material universe
would depend not only on the state immediately preceding, but also on much older states; the system would satisfy equations of finite differences. The ether was invented to escape this breaking down of the laws of general
mechanics.

Still, this would only compel us to fill the interplanetary space with ether, but not to make it penetrate
into the midst of the material media. 

Fizeau’s experiment goes further. By the interference of rays which
have passed through the air or water in motion, it seems to show us two different media penetrating each other, and yet being displaced with respect to each other. 

The ether is all but in our grasp. Experiments can be conceived in which we come closer still to it. Assume that
Newton’s principle of the equality of action and reaction is not true if applied to matter alone, and that this can
be proved. The geometrical sum of all the forces applied to all the molecules would no longer be zero. If we did
not wish to change the whole of the science of mechanics, we should have to introduce the ether, in order that
the action which matter apparently undergoes should be counterbalanced by the reaction of matter on something.
Or again, suppose we discover that optical and electrical phenomena are influenced by the motion of the earth.

It would follow that those phenomena might reveal to us
not only the relative motion of material bodies, but also
what would seem to be their absolute motion. 

Again, it would be necessary to have an ether in order that these
so-called absolute movements should not be their displacements with respect to empty space, but with respect
to something concrete.

Will this ever be accomplished? I do not think so,
and I shall explain why; and yet, it is not absurd, for
others have entertained this view. For instance, if the
theory of Lorentz, of which I shall speak in more detail
in Chapter XIII., were true, Newton’s principle would
not apply to matter alone, and the difference would not
be very far from being within reach of experiment. On
the other hand, many experiments have been made on
the influence of the motion of the earth. The results
have always been negative. But if these experiments have
been undertaken, it is because we have not been certain
beforehand; and indeed, according to current theories,
the compensation would be only approximate, and we
might expect to find accurate methods giving positivethe theories of modern physics.
191
results. I think that such a hope is illusory; it was none
the less interesting to show that a success of this kind
would, in a certain sense, open to us a new world.
And now allow me to make a digression; I must ex-
plain why I do not believe, in spite of Lorentz, that more
exact observations will ever make evident anything else
but the relative displacements of material bodies. Exper-
iments have been made that should have disclosed the
terms of the first order; the results were nugatory. Could
that have been by chance? No one has admitted this;
a general explanation was sought, and Lorentz found it.
He showed that the terms of the first order should can-
cel each other, but not the terms of the second order.
Then more exact experiments were made, which were
also negative; neither could this be the result of chance.
An explanation was necessary, and was forthcoming; they
always are; hypotheses are what we lack the least. But
this is not enough. Who is there who does not think that
this leaves to chance far too important a rôle? Would it
not also be a chance that this singular concurrence should
cause a certain circumstance to destroy the terms of the
first order, and that a totally different but very oppor-
tune circumstance should cause those of the second order
to vanish? No; the same explanation must be found forscience and hypothesis
192
the two cases, and everything tends to show that this ex-
planation would serve equally well for the terms of the
higher order, and that the mutual destruction of these
terms will be rigorous and absolute.
The Present State of Physics.—Two opposite tenden-
cies may be distinguished in the history of the develop-
ment of physics. On the one hand, new relations are con-
tinually being discovered between objects which seemed
destined to remain for ever unconnected; scattered facts
cease to be strangers to each other and tend to be mar-
shalled into an imposing synthesis. The march of science
is towards unity and simplicity.
On the other hand, new phenomena are continually
being revealed; it will be long before they can be assigned
their place—sometimes it may happen that to find them
a place a corner of the edifice must be demolished. In the
same way, we are continually perceiving details ever more
varied in the phenomena we know, where our crude senses
used to be unable to detect any lack of unity. What we
thought to be simple becomes complex, and the march of
science seems to be towards diversity and complication.
Here, then, are two opposing tendencies, each of
which seems to triumph in turn. Which will win? If
the first wins, science is possible; but nothing provesthe theories of modern physics.
193
this à priori, and it may be that after unsuccessful ef-
forts to bend Nature to our ideal of unity in spite of
herself, we shall be submerged by the ever-rising flood
of our new riches and compelled to renounce all idea
of classification—to abandon our ideal, and to reduce
science to the mere recording of innumerable recipes.
In fact, we can give this question no answer. All that
we can do is to observe the science of to-day, and compare
it with that of yesterday. No doubt after this examination
we shall be in a position to offer a few conjectures.
Half-a-century ago hopes ran high indeed. The unity
of force had just been revealed to us by the discovery
of the conservation of energy and of its transformation.
This discovery also showed that the phenomena of heat
could be explained by molecular movements. Although
the nature of these movements was not exactly known, no
one doubted but that they would be ascertained before
long. As for light, the work seemed entirely completed.
So far as electricity was concerned, there was not so great
an advance. Electricity had just annexed magnetism.
This was a considerable and a definitive step towards
unity. But how was electricity in its turn to be brought
into the general unity, and how was it to be included in
the general universal mechanism? No one had the slight-science and hypothesis
194
est idea. As to the possibility of the inclusion, all were
agreed; they had faith. Finally, as far as the molecular
properties of material bodies are concerned, the inclusion
seemed easier, but the details were very hazy. In a word,
hopes were vast and strong, but vague.
To-day, what do we see? In the first place, a step in
advance—immense progress. The relations between light
and electricity are now known; the three domains of light,
electricity, and magnetism, formerly separated, are now
one; and this annexation seems definitive.
Nevertheless the conquest has caused us some sac-
rifices. Optical phenomena become particular cases in
electric phenomena; as long as the former remained iso-
lated, it was easy to explain them by movements which
were thought to be known in all their details. That was
easy enough; but any explanation to be accepted must
now cover the whole domain of electricity. This cannot
be done without difficulty.
The most satisfactory theory is that of Lorentz; it is
unquestionably the theory that best explains the known
facts, the one that throws into relief the greatest num-
ber of known relations, the one in which we find most
traces of definitive construction. That it still possesses a
serious fault I have shown above. It is in contradictionthe theories of modern physics.
195
with Newton’s law that action and reaction are equal and
opposite—or rather, this principle according to Lorentz
cannot be applicable to matter alone; if it be true, it must
take into account the action of the ether on matter, and
the reaction of the matter on the ether. Now, in the new
order, it is very likely that things do not happen in this
way.
However this may be, it is due to Lorentz that the
results of Fizeau on the optics of moving bodies, the laws
of normal and abnormal dispersion and of absorption are
connected with each other and with the other properties
of the ether, by bonds which no doubt will not be readily
severed. Look at the ease with which the new Zeeman
phenomenon found its place, and even aided the classifi-
cation of Faraday’s magnetic rotation, which had defied
all Maxwell’s efforts. This facility proves that Lorentz’s
theory is not a mere artificial combination which must
eventually find its solvent. It will probably have to be
modified, but not destroyed.
The only object of Lorentz was to include in a sin-
gle whole all the optics and electro-dynamics of moving
bodies; he did not claim to give a mechanical explana-
tion. Larmor goes further; keeping the essential part of
Lorentz’s theory, he grafts upon it, so to speak, Mac-science and hypothesis
196
Cullagh’s ideas on the direction of the movement of the
ether. MacCullagh held that the velocity of the ether
is the same in magnitude and direction as the magnetic
force. Ingenious as is this attempt, the fault in Lorentz’s
theory remains, and is even aggravated. According to
Lorentz, we do not know what the movements of the ether
are; and because we do not know this, we may suppose
them to be movements compensating those of matter,
and re-affirming that action and reaction are equal and
opposite. According to Larmor we know the movements
of the ether, and we can prove that the compensation
does not take place.
If Larmor has failed, as in my opinion he has, does
it necessarily follow that a mechanical explanation is im-
possible? Far from it. I said above that as long as a
phenomenon obeys the two principles of energy and least
action, so long it allows of an unlimited number of me-
chanical explanations. And so with the phenomena of
optics and electricity.
But this is not enough. For a mechanical explanation
to be good it must be simple; to choose it from among
all the explanations that are possible there must be other
reasons than the necessity of making a choice. Well, we
have no theory as yet which will satisfy this condition andthe theories of modern physics.
197
consequently be of any use. Are we then to complain?
That would be to forget the end we seek, which is not
the mechanism; the true and only aim is unity.
We ought therefore to set some limits to our ambition.
Let us not seek to formulate a mechanical explanation;
let us be content to show that we can always find one
if we wish. In this we have succeeded. The principle of
the conservation of energy has always been confirmed,
and now it has a fellow in the principle of least action,
stated in the form appropriate to physics. This has also
been verified, at least as far as concerns the reversible
phenomena which obey Lagrange’s equations—in other
words, which obey the most general laws of physics. The
irreversible phenomena are much more difficult to bring
into line; but they, too, are being co-ordinated and tend
to come into the unity. The light which illuminates them
comes from Carnot’s principle. For a long time thermo-
dynamics was confined to the study of the dilatations
of bodies and of their change of state. For some time
past it has been growing bolder, and has considerably
extended its domain. We owe to it the theories of the
voltaic cell and of their thermo-electric phenomena; there
is not a corner in physics which it has not explored, and it
has even attacked chemistry itself. The same laws holdscience and hypothesis
198
good; everywhere, disguised in some form or other, we
find Carnot’s principle; everywhere also appears that em-
inently abstract concept of entropy which is as universal
as the concept of energy, and like it, seems to conceal
a reality. It seemed that radiant heat must escape, but
recently that, too, has been brought under the same laws.
In this way fresh analogies are revealed which may
be often pursued in detail; electric resistance resembles
the viscosity of fluids; hysteresis would rather be like the
friction of solids. In all cases friction appears to be the
type most imitated by the most diverse irreversible phe-
nomena, and this relationship is real and profound.
A strictly mechanical explanation of these phenom-
ena has also been sought, but, owing to their nature, it
is hardly likely that it will be found. To find it, it has
been necessary to suppose that the irreversibility is but
apparent, that the elementary phenomena are reversible
and obey the known laws of dynamics. But the elements
are extremely numerous, and become blended more and
more, so that to our crude sight all appears to tend to-
wards uniformity—i.e., all seems to progress in the same
direction, and that without hope of return. The apparent
irreversibility is therefore but an effect of the law of great
numbers. Only a being of infinitely subtle senses, suchthe theories of modern physics.
199
as Maxwell’s demon, could unravel this tangled skein and
turn back the course of the universe.
This conception, which is connected with the kinetic
theory of gases, has cost great effort and has not, on the
whole, been fruitful; it may become so. This is not the
place to examine if it leads to contradictions, and if it is
in conformity with the true nature of things.
Let us notice, however, the original ideas of M. Gouy
on the Brownian movement. According to this scientist,
this singular movement does not obey Carnot’s principle.
The particles which it sets moving would be smaller than
the meshes of that tightly drawn net; they would thus
be ready to separate them, and thereby to set back the
course of the universe. One can almost see Maxwell’s
demon at work. 1
To resume, phenomena long known are gradually be-
ing better classified, but new phenomena come to claim
their place, and most of them, like the Zeeman effect,
find it at once. Then we have the cathode rays, the X-
rays, uranium and radium rays; in fact, a whole world

200
of which none had suspected the existence. How many
unexpected guests to find a place for! No one can yet
predict the place they will occupy, but I do not believe
they will destroy the general unity: I think that they
will rather complete it. On the one hand, indeed, the
new radiations seem to be connected with the phenom-
ena of luminosity; not only do they excite fluorescence,
but they sometimes come into existence under the same
conditions as that property; neither are they unrelated
to the cause which produces the electric spark under the
action of ultra-violet light. Finally, and most important
of all, it is believed that in all these phenomena there
exist ions, animated, it is true, with velocities far greater
than those of electrolytes. All this is very vague, but it
will all become clearer.
Phosphorescence and the action of light on the spark
were regions rather isolated, and consequently somewhat
neglected by investigators. It is to be hoped that a new
path will now be made which will facilitate their com-
munications with the rest of science. Not only do we
discover new phenomena, but those we think we know
are revealed in unlooked-for aspects. In the free ether
the laws preserve their majestic simplicity, but matter
properly so called seems more and more complex; all wethe theories of modern physics.

can say of it is but approximate, and our formulæ are
constantly requiring new terms.
But the ranks are unbroken, the relations that we
have discovered between objects we thought simple still
hold good between the same objects when their complex-
ity is recognised, and that alone is the important thing.
Our equations become, it is true, more and more com-
plicated, so as to embrace more closely the complexity
of nature; but nothing is changed in the relations which
enable these equations to be derived from each other. In
a word, the form of these equations persists. Take for in-
stance the laws of reflection. Fresnel established them by
a simple and attractive theory which experiment seemed
to confirm. Subsequently, more accurate researches have
shown that this verification was but approximate; traces
of elliptic polarisation were detected everywhere. But it
is owing to the first approximation that the cause of these
anomalies was found in the existence of a transition layer,
and all the essentials of Fresnel’s theory have remained.
We cannot help reflecting that all these relations would
never have been noted if there had been doubt in the first
place as to the complexity of the objects they connect.
Long ago it was said: If Tycho had had instruments ten
times as precise, we would never have had a Kepler, or a Newton, or Astronomy. It is a misfortune for a science
to be born too late, when the means of observation have
become too perfect. That is what is happening at this
moment with respect to physical chemistry; the founders
are hampered in their general grasp by third and fourth
decimal places; happily they are men of robust faith. As
we get to know the properties of matter better we see
that continuity reigns. From the work of Andrews and
Van der Waals, we see how the transition from the liquid
to the gaseous state is made, and that it is not abrupt.
Similarly, there is no gap between the liquid and solid
states, and in the proceedings of a recent Congress we
see memoirs on the rigidity of liquids side by side with
papers on the flow of solids.
With this tendency there is no doubt a loss of simplic-
ity. Such and such an effect was represented by straight
lines; it is now necessary to connect these lines by more
or less complicated curves. On the other hand, unity is
gained. Separate categories quieted but did not satisfy
the mind.
Finally, a new domain, that of chemistry, has been
invaded by the method of physics, and we see the birth of
physical chemistry. It is still quite young, but already it
has enabled us to connect such phenomena as electrolysis,the theories of modern physics.

osmosis, and the movements of ions.

From this cursory exposition what can we conclude?
Taking all things into account, we have approached the
realisation of unity. This has not been done as quickly as
was hoped fifty years ago, and the path predicted has not
always been followed; but, on the whole, much ground has been gained.
