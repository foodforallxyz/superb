Ampère’s immortal work is "Théorie des phénomènes electro-dynamiques, uniquement fondée sur expérience". 

He had made no hypotheses; but as we shall not be long in recognising, he was mistaken; only, of these hypotheses he was quite unaware. 

On the other hand, his successors see them clearly enough, because their attention is at-
tracted by the weak points in Ampère’s solution. They
made fresh hypotheses, but this time deliberately. How
many times they had to change them before they reached
the classic system, which is perhaps even now not quite
definitive, we shall see.

I. Ampère’s Theory

In Ampère’s experimental study of the mutual action of currents, he has oper-
ated, and he could operate only, with closed currents.
This was not because he denied the existence or possi-
bility of open currents. If two conductors are positively
and negatively charged and brought into communication
by a wire, a current is set up which passes from one to
the other until the two potentials are equal. 

According to the ideas of Ampère’s time, this was considered to be an open current; the current was known to pass from the first conductor to the second, but they did not know
it returned from the second to the first. All currents
of this kind were therefore considered by Ampère to be
open currents—for instance, the currents of discharge of
a condenser; he was unable to experiment on them, their
duration being too short. Another kind of open current
may be imagined. Suppose we have two conductors
A and B connected by a wire AMB. 

Small conducting masses in motion are first of all placed in contact with
the conductor B, receive an electric charge, and leav-
ing B are set in motion along a path BNA, carrying
their charge with them. On coming into contact with A
they lose their charge, which then returns to B along the
wire AMB. Now here we have, in a sense, a closed circuit,
since the electricity describes the closed circuit BNAMB;
but the two parts of the current are quite different. In
the wire AMB the electricity is displaced through a fixed
conductor like a voltaic current, overcoming an ohmic
resistance and developing heat; we say that it is dis-
placed by conduction. In the part BNA the electricity
is carried by a moving conductor, and is said to be dis-
placed by convection. If therefore the convection currentelectro-dynamics.

is considered to be perfectly analogous to the conduction
current, the circuit BNAMB is closed; if on the contrary
the convection current is not a “true current,” and, for
instance, does not act on the magnet, there is only the
conduction current AMB, which is open. For example, if
we connect by a wire the poles of a Holtz machine, the
charged rotating disc transfers the electricity by convec-
tion from one pole to the other, and it returns to the
first pole by conduction through the wire. But currents
of this kind are very difficult to produce with appreciable
intensity; in fact, with the means at Ampère’s disposal
we may almost say it was impossible.
To sum up, Ampère could conceive of the existence
of two kinds of open currents, but he could experiment
on neither, because they were not strong enough, or be-
cause their duration was too short. Experiment therefore
could only show him the action of a closed current on a
closed current—or more accurately, the action of a closed
current on a portion of current, because a current can be
made to describe a closed circuit, of which part may be
in motion and the other part fixed. The displacements
of the moving part may be studied under the action of
another closed current. On the other hand, Ampère had no means of studying the action of an open current either on a closed or on another open current.

1. The Case of Closed Currents.—In the case of the mutual action of two closed currents, experiment revealed to Ampère remarkably simple laws. The following will be
useful to us in the sequel:—

(1) If the intensity of the currents is kept constant,
and if the two circuits, after having undergone any dis-
placements and deformations whatever, return finally to
their initial positions, the total work done by the electro-
dynamical actions is zero. In other words, there is an
electro-dynamical potential of the two circuits propor-
tional to the product of their intensities, and depending
on the form and relative positions of the circuits; the
work done by the electro-dynamical actions is equal to
the change of this potential.
(2) The action of a closed solenoid is zero.
(3) The action of a circuit C on another voltaic cir-
cuit C 0 depends only on the “magnetic field” developed
by the circuit C. At each point in space we can, in fact,
define in magnitude and direction a certain force called
“magnetic force,” which enjoys the following properties:—
(a) The force exercised by C on a magnetic pole is
applied to that pole, and is equal to the magnetic force
multiplied by the magnetic mass of the pole.electro-dynamics.
255
(b) A very short magnetic needle tends to take the
direction of the magnetic force, and the couple to which
it tends to reduce is proportional to the product of the
magnetic force, the magnetic moment of the needle, and
the sine of the dip of the needle.
(c) If the circuit C 0 is displaced, the amount of the
work done by the electro-dynamic action of C on C 0 will
be equal to the increment of “flow of magnetic force”
which passes through the circuit.

2. Action of a Closed Current on a Portion of Cur-
rent.—Ampère being unable to produce the open current
properly so called, had only one way of studying the ac-
tion of a closed current on a portion of current. This was
by operating on a circuit C composed of two parts, one
movable and the other fixed. The movable part was, for
instance, a movable wire αβ, the ends α and β of which
could slide along a fixed wire. In one of the positions of
the movable wire the end α rested on the point A, and
the end β on the point B of the fixed wire. The current
ran from α to β—i.e., from A to B along the movable
wire, and then from B to A along the fixed wire. This
current was therefore closed.

In the second position, the movable wire having
slipped, the points α and β were respectively at A 0 and B 0science and hypothesis
256
on the fixed wire. The current ran from α to β—i.e.,
from A 0 to B 0 on the movable wire, and returned from B 0
to B, and then from B to A, and then from A to A 0 —all
on the fixed wire. This current was also closed. If a simi-
lar circuit be exposed to the action of a closed current C,
the movable part will be displaced just as if it were acted
on by a force. Ampère admits that the force, apparently
acting on the movable part AB, representing the action
of C on the portion αβ of the current, remains the same
whether an open current runs through αβ, stopping at
α and β, or whether a closed current runs first to β and
then returns to α through the fixed portion of the circuit.
This hypothesis seemed natural enough, and Ampère in-
nocently assumed it; nevertheless the hypothesis is not
a necessity, for we shall presently see that Helmholtz
rejected it. However that may be, it enabled Ampère,
although he had never produced an open current, to lay
down the laws of the action of a closed current on an
open current, or even on an element of current. They
are simple:—

(1) The force acting on an element of current is ap-
plied to that element; it is normal to the element and to
the magnetic force, and proportional to that component
of the magnetic force which is normal to the element.electro-dynamics.

(2) The action of a closed solenoid on an element of
current is zero. But the electro-dynamic potential has
disappeared—i.e., when a closed and an open current of
constant intensities return to their initial positions, the
total work done is not zero.

3. Continuous Rotations.—The most remarkable
electro-dynamical experiments are those in which con-
tinuous rotations are produced, and which are called
unipolar induction experiments. A magnet may turn
about its axis; a current passes first through a fixed wire
and then enters the magnet by the pole N, for instance,
passes through half the magnet, and emerges by a sliding
contact and re-enters the fixed wire. The magnet then
begins to rotate continuously. This is Faraday’s exper-
iment. How is it possible? If it were a question of two
circuits of invariable form, C fixed and C 0 movable about
an axis, the latter would never take up a position of con-
tinuous rotation; in fact, there is an electro-dynamical
potential; there must therefore be a position of equi-
librium when the potential is a maximum. Continuous
rotations are therefore possible only when the circuit C 0 is
composed of two parts—one fixed, and the other movable
about an axis, as in the case of Faraday’s experiment.
Here again it is convenient to draw a distinction. 

The passage from the fixed to the movable part, or vice versâ, may take place either by simple contact, the same point of the movable part remaining constantly in contact with
the same point of the fixed part, or by sliding contact,
the same point of the movable part coming successively
into contact with the different points of the fixed part.
It is only in the second case that there can be contin-
uous rotation. This is what then happens:—the system
tends to take up a position of equilibrium; but, when at
the point of reaching that position, the sliding contact
puts the moving part in contact with a fresh point in the
fixed part; it changes the connexions and therefore the
conditions of equilibrium, so that as the position of equi-
librium is ever eluding, so to speak, the system which is
trying to reach it, rotation may take place indefinitely.
Ampère admits that the action of the circuit on the
movable part of C 0 is the same as if the fixed part of C 0
did not exist, and therefore as if the current passing
through the movable part were an open current. He con-
cluded that the action of a closed on an open current, or
vice versâ, that of an open current on a fixed current, may
give rise to continuous rotation. But this conclusion de-
pends on the hypothesis which I have enunciated, and to
which, as I said above, Helmholtz declined to subscribe.electro-dynamics.

4. Mutual Action of Two Open Currents.—As far as
the mutual action of two open currents, and in particular
that of two elements of current, is concerned, all exper-
iment breaks down. Ampère falls back on hypothesis.
He assumes: (1) that the mutual action of two elements
reduces to a force acting along their join; (2) that the ac-
tion of two closed currents is the resultant of the mutual
actions of their different elements, which are the same as
if these elements were isolated.

The remarkable thing is that here again Ampère
makes two hypotheses without being aware of it. How-
ever that may be, these two hypotheses, together with
the experiments on closed currents, suffice to determine
completely the law of mutual action of two elements.
But then, most of the simple laws we have met in the
case of closed currents are no longer true. In the first
place, there is no electro-dynamical potential; nor was
there any, as we have seen, in the case of a closed cur-
rent acting on an open current. Next, there is, properly
speaking, no magnetic force; and we have above defined
this force in three different ways: (1) By the action
on a magnetic pole; (2) by the director couple which
orientates the magnetic needle; (3) by the action on an
element of current.science and hypothesis

In the case with which we are immediately concerned,
not only are these three definitions not in harmony, but
each has lost its meaning:—

(1) A magnetic pole is no longer acted on by a unique
force applied to that pole. We have seen, in fact, the
action of an element of current on a pole is not applied
to the pole but to the element; it may, moreover, be
replaced by a force applied to the pole and by a couple.
(2) The couple which acts on the magnetic needle is
no longer a simple director couple, for its moment with
respect to the axis of the needle is not zero. It decom-
poses into a director couple, properly so called, and a
supplementary couple which tends to produce the con-
tinuous rotation of which we have spoken above.

(3) Finally, the force acting on an element of a current
is not normal to that element. In other words, the unity
of the magnetic force has disappeared.
Let us see in what this unity consists. Two systems
which exercise the same action on a magnetic pole will
also exercise the same action on an indefinitely small
magnetic needle, or on an element of current placed at
the point in space at which the pole is. Well, this is true
if the two systems only contain closed currents, and ac-
cording to Ampère it would not be true if the systemselectro-dynamics.
261
contained open currents. It is sufficient to remark, for
instance, that if a magnetic pole is placed at A and an
element at B, the direction of the element being in AB
produced, this element, which will exercise no action on
the pole, will exercise an action either on a magnetic nee-
dle placed at A, or on an element of current at A.
5. Induction.—We know that the discovery of electro-
dynamical induction followed not long after the immortal
work of Ampère. As long as it is only a question of closed
currents there is no difficulty, and Helmholtz has even
remarked that the principle of the conservation of energy
is sufficient for us to deduce the laws of induction from the
electro-dynamical laws of Ampère. But on the condition,
as Bertrand has shown,—that we make a certain number
of hypotheses.

The same principle again enables this deduction to
be made in the case of open currents, although the re-
sult cannot be tested by experiment, since such currents
cannot be produced.
If we wish to compare this method of analysis with
Ampère’s theorem on open currents, we get results which
are calculated to surprise us. In the first place, induction
cannot be deduced from the variation of the magnetic
field by the well-known formula of scientists and practi-science and hypothesis
262
cal men; in fact, as I have said, properly speaking, there
is no magnetic field. But further, if a circuit C is sub-
jected to the induction of a variable voltaic system S, and
if this system S be displaced and deformed in any way
whatever, so that the intensity of the currents of this sys-
tem varies according to any law whatever, then so long
as after these variations the system eventually returns to
its initial position, it seems natural to suppose that the
mean electro-motive force induced in the circuit C is zero.
This is true if the circuit C is closed, and if the system S
only contains closed currents. It is no longer true if we
accept the theory of Ampère, since there would be open
currents. So that not only will induction no longer be
the variation of the flow of magnetic force in any of the
usual senses of the word, but it cannot be represented by
the variation of that force whatever it may be.
