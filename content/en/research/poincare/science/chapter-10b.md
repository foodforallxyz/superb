## Physics and Mechanism

Most theorists have a
constant predilection for explanations borrowed from
physics, mechanics, or dynamics. Some would be sat-
isfied if they could account for all phenomena by the
motion of molecules attracting one another accordingscience and hypothesis

to certain laws. Others are more exact: they would
suppress attractions acting at a distance; their molecules
would follow rectilinear paths, from which they would
only be deviated by impacts. Others again, such as
Hertz, suppress the forces as well, but suppose their
molecules subjected to geometrical connections analo-
gous, for instance, to those of articulated systems; thus,
they wish to reduce dynamics to a kind of kinematics. In
a word, they all wish to bend nature into a certain form,
and unless they can do this they cannot be satisfied. Is
Nature flexible enough for this?
We shall examine this question in Chapter 12, àpro-
pos of Maxwell’s theory. 

Every time that the principles of least action and energy are satisfied, we shall see that not
only is there always a mechanical explanation possible,
but that there is an unlimited number of such explana-
tions. 

By means of a well-known theorem due to Königs, it may be shown that we can explain everything in an unlimited number of ways, by connections after the manner of Hertz, or, again, by central forces. 

No doubt it may be just as easily demonstrated that everything may be explained by simple impacts. For this, let us bear in mind
that it is not enough to be content with the ordinary matter of which we are aware by means of our senses, and the movements of which we observe directly. 

Ordinary matter is either composed of:
- atoms, or
  - The internal movements of these escape our senses
- one of those subtle fluids, called the ether
  - This has always played so important a rôle in physical theories.

<!-- able to estimate only the displacement of the whole; or we may imagine  -->


Often we regard the ether as the only <!-- primitive, or even as the only --> true matter. 

The more moderate consider ordinary matter to be condensed ether. There is nothing startling in this conception. 

But others only reduce its importance still further, and see in matter nothing more than the geometrical locus of singularities in
the ether. 

Lord Kelvin, for instance, holds what we call matter to be only the locus of those points at which the ether is animated by vortex motions. 

Riemann believes it to be locus of those points at which ether is constantly destroyed. 

Wiechert or Larmor believes that it is the locus of the points at which the ether has undergone a kind of torsion of a very particular kind. 

But why do we apply the mechanical properties of ordinary matter, which is but false matter, to the ether?

The ancient fluids, caloric,
electricity, etc., were abandoned when it was seen that heat is not indestructible. 

But they were also laid aside for another reason, In materialising them, their individ-
uality was, so to speak, emphasised—gaps were opened
between them; 

these gaps had to be filled in when the sentiment of the unity of Nature became stronger,
and when the intimate relations which connect all the
parts were perceived. 

In multiplying the fluids, not only did the ancient physicists create unnecessary entities, but
they destroyed real ties. 

It is not enough for a theory not to affirm false relations; it must not conceal true relations.

Does our ether actually exist? We know the origin of our belief in the ether. If light takes several years to reach
us from a distant star, it is no longer on the star, nor is
it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported,
so to speak, by some material agency.

The same idea may be expressed in a more mathematical and more abstract form. What we note are the
changes undergone by the material molecules. 

A photographic plate experiences the consequences of a phenomenon of which the incandescent
mass of a star was the scene several years before. 

Now, in ordinary mechanics, the state of the system under consideration depends only on its state at the moment immediately preceding; the system therefore satisfies certain differential equations. On the other hand, if we did not
believe in the ether, the state of the material universe
would depend not only on the state immediately preceding, but also on much older states; the system would satisfy equations of finite differences. The ether was invented to escape this breaking down of the laws of general
mechanics.

Still, this would only compel us to fill the interplanetary space with ether, but not to make it penetrate
into the midst of the material media. 

Fizeau’s experiment goes further. By the interference of rays which
have passed through the air or water in motion, it seems to show us two different media penetrating each other, and yet being displaced with respect to each other. 

The ether is all but in our grasp. Experiments can be conceived in which we come closer still to it. Assume that
Newton’s principle of the equality of action and reaction is not true if applied to matter alone, and that this can
be proved. The geometrical sum of all the forces applied to all the molecules would no longer be zero. 

If we did not wish to change the whole of the science of mechanics, we should have to introduce the ether, in order that
the action which matter apparently undergoes should be counterbalanced by the reaction of matter on something.
Or again, suppose we discover that optical and electrical phenomena are influenced by the motion of the earth.

It would follow that those phenomena might reveal to us not only the relative motion of material bodies, but also
what would seem to be their absolute motion. 

Again, it would be necessary to have an ether in order that these
so-called absolute movements should not be their displacements with respect to empty space, but with respect
to something concrete.

Will this ever be accomplished? I do not think so, and I shall explain why; and yet, it is not absurd, for
others have entertained this view. For instance, if the theory of Lorentz, of which I shall speak in more detail
in Chapter XIII., were true, Newton’s principle would not apply to matter alone, and the difference would not
be very far from being within reach of experiment. 

On the other hand, many experiments have been made on the influence of the motion of the earth. The results
have always been negative. But if these experiments have been undertaken, it is because we have not been certain
beforehand; and indeed, according to current theories, the compensation would be only approximate, and we
might expect to find accurate methods giving positivethe theories of modern physics.

results. I think that such a hope is illusory; it was nonetheless interesting to show that a success of this kind
would, in a certain sense, open to us a new world.

And now allow me to make a digression; I must ex-
plain why I do not believe, in spite of Lorentz, that more
exact observations will ever make evident anything else
but the relative displacements of material bodies. 

Experiments have been made that should have disclosed the
terms of the first order; the results were nugatory. Could
that have been by chance? No one has admitted this;
a general explanation was sought, and Lorentz found it.
He showed that the terms of the first order should can-
cel each other, but not the terms of the second order.
Then more exact experiments were made, which were
also negative; neither could this be the result of chance.
An explanation was necessary, and was forthcoming; they
always are; hypotheses are what we lack the least. But
this is not enough. Who is there who does not think that
this leaves to chance far too important a rôle? Would it
not also be a chance that this singular concurrence should
cause a certain circumstance to destroy the terms of the
first order, and that a totally different but very oppor-
tune circumstance should cause those of the second order
to vanish? 

No; the same explanation must be found for the two cases, and everything tends to show that this ex-
planation would serve equally well for the terms of the
higher order, and that the mutual destruction of these
terms will be rigorous and absolute.

## The Present State of Physics

Two opposite tendencies may be distinguished in the history of the develop-
ment of physics. On the one hand, new relations are con-
tinually being discovered between objects which seemed
destined to remain for ever unconnected; scattered facts
cease to be strangers to each other and tend to be mar-
shalled into an imposing synthesis. The march of science
is towards unity and simplicity.
On the other hand, new phenomena are continually
being revealed; it will be long before they can be assigned
their place—sometimes it may happen that to find them
a place a corner of the edifice must be demolished. In the
same way, we are continually perceiving details ever more
varied in the phenomena we know, where our crude senses
used to be unable to detect any lack of unity. What we
thought to be simple becomes complex, and the march of
science seems to be towards diversity and complication.
Here, then, are two opposing tendencies, each of
which seems to triumph in turn. Which will win? If
the first wins, science is possible; but nothing provesthe theories of modern physics.
193
this à priori, and it may be that after unsuccessful ef-
forts to bend Nature to our ideal of unity in spite of
herself, we shall be submerged by the ever-rising flood
of our new riches and compelled to renounce all idea
of classification—to abandon our ideal, and to reduce
science to the mere recording of innumerable recipes.
In fact, we can give this question no answer. All that
we can do is to observe the science of to-day, and compare
it with that of yesterday. No doubt after this examination
we shall be in a position to offer a few conjectures.
Half-a-century ago hopes ran high indeed. The unity
of force had just been revealed to us by the discovery
of the conservation of energy and of its transformation.
This discovery also showed that the phenomena of heat
could be explained by molecular movements. Although
the nature of these movements was not exactly known, no
one doubted but that they would be ascertained before
long. As for light, the work seemed entirely completed.
So far as electricity was concerned, there was not so great
an advance. Electricity had just annexed magnetism.
This was a considerable and a definitive step towards
unity. But how was electricity in its turn to be brought
into the general unity, and how was it to be included in
the general universal mechanism? No one had the slight-science and hypothesis
194
est idea. As to the possibility of the inclusion, all were
agreed; they had faith. Finally, as far as the molecular
properties of material bodies are concerned, the inclusion
seemed easier, but the details were very hazy. In a word,
hopes were vast and strong, but vague.
To-day, what do we see? In the first place, a step in
advance—immense progress. The relations between light
and electricity are now known; the three domains of light,
electricity, and magnetism, formerly separated, are now
one; and this annexation seems definitive.
Nevertheless the conquest has caused us some sac-
rifices. Optical phenomena become particular cases in
electric phenomena; as long as the former remained iso-
lated, it was easy to explain them by movements which
were thought to be known in all their details. That was
easy enough; but any explanation to be accepted must
now cover the whole domain of electricity. This cannot
be done without difficulty.
The most satisfactory theory is that of Lorentz; it is
unquestionably the theory that best explains the known
facts, the one that throws into relief the greatest num-
ber of known relations, the one in which we find most
traces of definitive construction. That it still possesses a
serious fault I have shown above. It is in contradictionthe theories of modern physics.
195
with Newton’s law that action and reaction are equal and
opposite—or rather, this principle according to Lorentz
cannot be applicable to matter alone; if it be true, it must
take into account the action of the ether on matter, and
the reaction of the matter on the ether. Now, in the new
order, it is very likely that things do not happen in this
way.
However this may be, it is due to Lorentz that the
results of Fizeau on the optics of moving bodies, the laws
of normal and abnormal dispersion and of absorption are
connected with each other and with the other properties
of the ether, by bonds which no doubt will not be readily
severed. Look at the ease with which the new Zeeman
phenomenon found its place, and even aided the classifi-
cation of Faraday’s magnetic rotation, which had defied
all Maxwell’s efforts. This facility proves that Lorentz’s
theory is not a mere artificial combination which must
eventually find its solvent. It will probably have to be
modified, but not destroyed.
The only object of Lorentz was to include in a sin-
gle whole all the optics and electro-dynamics of moving
bodies; he did not claim to give a mechanical explana-
tion. Larmor goes further; keeping the essential part of
Lorentz’s theory, he grafts upon it, so to speak, Mac-science and hypothesis
196
Cullagh’s ideas on the direction of the movement of the
ether. MacCullagh held that the velocity of the ether
is the same in magnitude and direction as the magnetic
force. Ingenious as is this attempt, the fault in Lorentz’s
theory remains, and is even aggravated. According to
Lorentz, we do not know what the movements of the ether
are; and because we do not know this, we may suppose
them to be movements compensating those of matter,
and re-affirming that action and reaction are equal and
opposite. According to Larmor we know the movements
of the ether, and we can prove that the compensation
does not take place.
If Larmor has failed, as in my opinion he has, does
it necessarily follow that a mechanical explanation is im-
possible? Far from it. I said above that as long as a
phenomenon obeys the two principles of energy and least
action, so long it allows of an unlimited number of me-
chanical explanations. And so with the phenomena of
optics and electricity.
But this is not enough. For a mechanical explanation
to be good it must be simple; to choose it from among
all the explanations that are possible there must be other
reasons than the necessity of making a choice. Well, we
have no theory as yet which will satisfy this condition andthe theories of modern physics.
197
consequently be of any use. Are we then to complain?
That would be to forget the end we seek, which is not
the mechanism; the true and only aim is unity.
We ought therefore to set some limits to our ambition.
Let us not seek to formulate a mechanical explanation;
let us be content to show that we can always find one
if we wish. In this we have succeeded. The principle of
the conservation of energy has always been confirmed,
and now it has a fellow in the principle of least action,
stated in the form appropriate to physics. This has also
been verified, at least as far as concerns the reversible
phenomena which obey Lagrange’s equations—in other
words, which obey the most general laws of physics. The
irreversible phenomena are much more difficult to bring
into line; but they, too, are being co-ordinated and tend
to come into the unity. The light which illuminates them
comes from Carnot’s principle. For a long time thermo-
dynamics was confined to the study of the dilatations
of bodies and of their change of state. For some time
past it has been growing bolder, and has considerably
extended its domain. We owe to it the theories of the
voltaic cell and of their thermo-electric phenomena; there
is not a corner in physics which it has not explored, and it
has even attacked chemistry itself. The same laws holdscience and hypothesis
198
good; everywhere, disguised in some form or other, we
find Carnot’s principle; everywhere also appears that em-
inently abstract concept of entropy which is as universal
as the concept of energy, and like it, seems to conceal
a reality. It seemed that radiant heat must escape, but
recently that, too, has been brought under the same laws.
In this way fresh analogies are revealed which may
be often pursued in detail; electric resistance resembles
the viscosity of fluids; hysteresis would rather be like the
friction of solids. In all cases friction appears to be the
type most imitated by the most diverse irreversible phe-
nomena, and this relationship is real and profound.
A strictly mechanical explanation of these phenom-
ena has also been sought, but, owing to their nature, it
is hardly likely that it will be found. To find it, it has
been necessary to suppose that the irreversibility is but
apparent, that the elementary phenomena are reversible
and obey the known laws of dynamics. But the elements
are extremely numerous, and become blended more and
more, so that to our crude sight all appears to tend to-
wards uniformity—i.e., all seems to progress in the same
direction, and that without hope of return. The apparent
irreversibility is therefore but an effect of the law of great
numbers. Only a being of infinitely subtle senses, suchthe theories of modern physics.

as Maxwell’s demon, could unravel this tangled skein and
turn back the course of the universe.
This conception, which is connected with the kinetic
theory of gases, has cost great effort and has not, on the
whole, been fruitful; it may become so. This is not the
place to examine if it leads to contradictions, and if it is
in conformity with the true nature of things.
Let us notice, however, the original ideas of M. Gouy
on the Brownian movement. According to this scientist,
this singular movement does not obey Carnot’s principle.
The particles which it sets moving would be smaller than
the meshes of that tightly drawn net; they would thus
be ready to separate them, and thereby to set back the
course of the universe. One can almost see Maxwell’s
demon at work. 1
To resume, phenomena long known are gradually be-
ing better classified, but new phenomena come to claim
their place, and most of them, like the Zeeman effect,
find it at once. Then we have the cathode rays, the X-
rays, uranium and radium rays; in fact, a whole world

of which none had suspected the existence. How many
unexpected guests to find a place for! No one can yet
predict the place they will occupy, but I do not believe
they will destroy the general unity: I think that they
will rather complete it. On the one hand, indeed, the
new radiations seem to be connected with the phenom-
ena of luminosity; not only do they excite fluorescence,
but they sometimes come into existence under the same
conditions as that property; neither are they unrelated
to the cause which produces the electric spark under the
action of ultra-violet light. Finally, and most important
of all, it is believed that in all these phenomena there
exist ions, animated, it is true, with velocities far greater
than those of electrolytes. All this is very vague, but it
will all become clearer.
Phosphorescence and the action of light on the spark
were regions rather isolated, and consequently somewhat
neglected by investigators. It is to be hoped that a new
path will now be made which will facilitate their com-
munications with the rest of science. Not only do we
discover new phenomena, but those we think we know
are revealed in unlooked-for aspects. In the free ether
the laws preserve their majestic simplicity, but matter
properly so called seems more and more complex; all wethe theories of modern physics.

can say of it is but approximate, and our formulæ are
constantly requiring new terms.
But the ranks are unbroken, the relations that we
have discovered between objects we thought simple still
hold good between the same objects when their complex-
ity is recognised, and that alone is the important thing.
Our equations become, it is true, more and more com-
plicated, so as to embrace more closely the complexity
of nature; but nothing is changed in the relations which
enable these equations to be derived from each other. In
a word, the form of these equations persists. Take for in-
stance the laws of reflection. Fresnel established them by
a simple and attractive theory which experiment seemed
to confirm. Subsequently, more accurate researches have
shown that this verification was but approximate; traces
of elliptic polarisation were detected everywhere. But it
is owing to the first approximation that the cause of these
anomalies was found in the existence of a transition layer,
and all the essentials of Fresnel’s theory have remained.
We cannot help reflecting that all these relations would
never have been noted if there had been doubt in the first
place as to the complexity of the objects they connect.
Long ago it was said: If Tycho had had instruments ten
times as precise, we would never have had a Kepler, or a Newton, or Astronomy. It is a misfortune for a science
to be born too late, when the means of observation have
become too perfect. That is what is happening at this
moment with respect to physical chemistry; the founders
are hampered in their general grasp by third and fourth
decimal places; happily they are men of robust faith. As
we get to know the properties of matter better we see
that continuity reigns. From the work of Andrews and
Van der Waals, we see how the transition from the liquid
to the gaseous state is made, and that it is not abrupt.
Similarly, there is no gap between the liquid and solid
states, and in the proceedings of a recent Congress we
see memoirs on the rigidity of liquids side by side with
papers on the flow of solids.
With this tendency there is no doubt a loss of simplic-
ity. Such and such an effect was represented by straight
lines; it is now necessary to connect these lines by more
or less complicated curves. On the other hand, unity is
gained. Separate categories quieted but did not satisfy
the mind.
Finally, a new domain, that of chemistry, has been
invaded by the method of physics, and we see the birth of
physical chemistry. It is still quite young, but already it
has enabled us to connect such phenomena as electrolysis,the theories of modern physics.

osmosis, and the movements of ions.

From this cursory exposition what can we conclude?
Taking all things into account, we have approached the
realisation of unity. This has not been done as quickly as
was hoped fifty years ago, and the path predicted has not
always been followed; but, on the whole, much ground has been gained.
