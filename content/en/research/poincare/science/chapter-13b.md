I have dwelt upon the consequences of Ampère’s theory and on his method of explaining the action of open currents. It is difficult to disregard the paradoxical and artificial character of the propositions to which we are thus led. We feel bound to think “it
cannot be so.” 

Helmholtz has been led to look for something else. He rejects the fundamental hypothesis of Ampère— the mutual electro-dynamics.

action of two elements of current reduces to a force along
their join. He admits that an clement of current is not
acted upon by a single force but by a force and a cou-
ple, and this is what gave rise to the celebrated polemic
between Bertrand and Helmholtz. 

Helmholtz replaces Ampère’s hypothesis:

Two elements of current always admit of an electro-dynamic potential, de-
pending solely upon their position and orientation; and
the work of the forces that they exercise one on the other
is equal to the variation of this potential. Thus Helmholtz
can no more do without hypothesis than Ampère, but at
least he does not do so without explicitly announcing it.
In the case of closed currents, which alone are accessible
to experiment, the two theories agree; in all other cases
they differ. In the first place, contrary to what Ampère
supposed, the force which seems to act on the movable
portion of a closed current is not the same as that acting
on the movable portion if it were isolated and if it consti-
tuted an open current. Let us return to the circuit C 0 , of
which we spoke above, and which was formed of a mov-
able wire sliding on a fixed wire. In the only experiment
that can be made the movable portion αβ is not isolated,
but is part of a closed circuit. When it passes from AB
to A 0 B 0 , the total electro-dynamic potential varies for twoscience and hypothesis
264
reasons. First, it has a slight increment because the po-
tential of A 0 B 0 with respect to the circuit C is not the
same as that of AB; secondly, it has a second increment
because it must be increased by the potentials of the el-
ements AA 0 and B 0 B with respect to C. It is this double
increment which represents the work of the force acting
upon the portion AB. If, on the contrary, αβ be iso-
lated, the potential would only have the first increment,
and this first increment alone would measure the work
of the force acting on AB. In the second place, there
could be no continuous rotation without sliding contact,
and in fact, that, as we have seen in the case of closed
currents, is an immediate consequence of the existence of
an electro-dynamic potential. In Faraday’s experiment, if
the magnet is fixed, and if the part of the current external
to the magnet runs along a movable wire, that movable
wire may undergo continuous rotation. But it does not
mean that, if the contacts of the wire with the magnet
were suppressed, and an open current were to run along
the wire, the wire would still have a movement of contin-
uous rotation. I have just said, in fact, that an isolated
element is not acted on in the same way as a movable ele-
ment making part of a closed circuit. But there is another
difference. The action of a solenoid on a closed currentelectro-dynamics.
265
is zero according to experiment and according to the two
theories. Its action on an open current would be zero ac-
cording to Ampère, and it would not be zero according to
Helmholtz. From this follows an important consequence.
We have given above three definitions of the magnetic
force. The third has no meaning here, since an element
of current is no longer acted upon by a single force. Nor
has the first any meaning. What, in fact, is a magnetic
pole? It is the extremity of an indefinite linear magnet.
This magnet may be replaced by an indefinite solenoid.
For the definition of magnetic force to have any meaning,
the action exercised by an open current on an indefinite
solenoid would only depend on the position of the ex-
tremity of that solenoid—i.e., that the action of a closed
solenoid is zero. Now we have just seen that this is not
the case. On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent
us from adopting the second definition which is founded
on the measurement of the director couple which tends to
orientate the magnetic needle; but, if it is adopted, nei-
ther the effects of induction nor electro-dynamic effects
will depend solely on the distribution of the lines of force
in this magnetic field.
III. Difficulties raised by these Theories.—Helmholtz’s
theory is an advance on that of Ampère; it is necessary,science and hypothesis
266
however, that every difficulty should be removed. In
both, the name “magnetic field” has no meaning, or, if
we give it one by a more or less artificial convention, the
ordinary laws so familiar to electricians no longer apply;
and it is thus that the electro-motive force induced in
a wire is no longer measured by the number of lines
of force met by that wire. And our objections do not
proceed only from the fact that it is difficult to give up
deeply-rooted habits of language and thought. There is
something more. If we do not believe in actions at a
distance, electro-dynamic phenomena must be explained
by a modification of the medium. And this medium
is precisely what we call “magnetic field,” and then the
electro-magnetic effects should only depend on that field.
All these difficulties arise from the hypothesis of open
currents.
IV. Maxwell’s Theory.—Such were the difficulties
raised by the current theories, when Maxwell with a
stroke of the pen caused them to vanish. To his mind,
in fact, all currents are closed currents. Maxwell ad-
mits that if in a dielectric, the electric field happens
to vary, this dielectric becomes the seat of a particular
phenomenon acting on the galvanometer like a current
and called the current of displacement. If, then, two con-electro-dynamics.
267
ductors bearing positive and negative charges are placed
in connection by means of a wire, during the discharge
there is an open current of conduction in that wire; but
there are produced at the same time in the surrounding
dielectric currents of displacement which close this cur-
rent of conduction. We know that Maxwell’s theory leads
to the explanation of optical phenomena which would
be due to extremely rapid electrical oscillations. At that
period such a conception was only a daring hypothesis
which could be supported by no experiment; but after
twenty years Maxwell’s ideas received the confirmation
of experiment. Hertz succeeded in producing systems of
electric oscillations which reproduce all the properties of
light, and only differ by the length of their wave—that
is to say, as violet differs from red. In some measure
he made a synthesis of light. It might be said that
Hertz has not directly proved Maxwell’s fundamental
idea of the action of the current of displacement on the
galvanometer. That is true in a sense. What he has
shown directly is that electro-magnetic induction is not
instantaneously propagated, as was supposed, but its
speed is the speed of light. Yet, to suppose there is no
current of displacement, and that induction is with the
speed of light; or, rather, to suppose that the currents ofscience and hypothesis
268
displacement produce inductive effects, and that the in-
duction takes place instantaneously—comes to the same
thing. This cannot be seen at the first glance, but it is
proved by an analysis of which I must not even think of
giving even a summary here.
V. Rowland’s Experiment.—But, as I have said above,
there are two kinds of open conduction currents. There
are first the currents of discharge of a condenser, or of any
conductor whatever. There are also cases in which the
electric charges describe a closed contour, being displaced
by conduction in one part of the circuit and by convection
in the other part. The question might be regarded as
solved for open currents of the first kind; they were closed
by currents of displacement. For open currents of the
second kind the solution appeared still more simple.
It seemed that if the current were closed it could only
be by the current of convection itself. For that purpose it
was sufficient to admit that a “convection current”—i.e.,
a charged conductor in motion—could act on the gal-
vanometer. But experimental confirmation was lacking.
It appeared difficult, in fact, to obtain a sufficient inten-
sity even by increasing as much as possible the charge and
the velocity of the conductors. Rowland, an extremely
skilful experimentalist, was the first to triumph, or toelectro-dynamics.
269
seem to triumph, over these difficulties. A disc received
a strong electro-static charge and a very high speed of
rotation. An astatic magnetic system placed beside the
disc underwent deviations. The experiment was made
twice by Rowland, once in Berlin and once at Baltimore.
It was afterwards repeated by Himstedt. These physi-
cists even believed that they could announce that they
had succeeded in making quantitative measurements. For
twenty years Rowland’s law was admitted without objec-
tion by all physicists, and, indeed, everything seemed to
confirm it. The spark certainly does produce a mag-
netic effect, and does it not seem extremely likely that
the spark discharged is due to particles taken from one of
the electrodes and transferred to the other electrode with
their charge? Is not the very spectrum of the spark, in
which we recognise the lines of the metal of the electrode,
a proof of it? The spark would then be a real current of
induction.
On the other hand, it is also admitted that in an
electrolyte the electricity is carried by the ions in mo-
tion. The current in an electrolyte would therefore also
be a current of convection; but it acts on the magnetic
needle. And in the same way for cathode rays; Crookes
attributed these rays to very subtle matter charged withscience and hypothesis
270
negative electricity and moving with very high velocity.
He looked upon them, in other words, as currents of con-
vection. Now, these cathode rays are deviated by the
magnet. In virtue of the principle of action and reac-
tion, they should in their turn deviate the magnetic nee-
dle. It is true that Hertz believed he had proved that
the cathodic rays do not carry negative electricity, and
that they do not act on the magnetic needle; but Hertz
was wrong. First of all, Perrin succeeded in collecting
the electricity carried by these rays—electricity of which
Hertz denied the existence; the German scientist appears
to have been deceived by the effects due to the action of
the X-rays, which were not yet discovered. Afterwards,
and quite recently, the action of the cathodic rays on the
magnetic needle has been brought to light. Thus all these
phenomena looked upon as currents of convection, elec-
tric sparks, electrolytic currents, cathodic rays, act in the
same manner on the galvanometer and in conformity to
Rowland’s law.
VI. Lorentz’s Theory.—We need not go much further.
According to Lorentz’s theory, currents of conduction
would themselves be true convection currents. Electricity
would remain indissolubly connected with certain mate-
rial particles called electrons. The circulation of theseelectro-dynamics.
271
electrons through bodies would produce voltaic currents,
and what would distinguish conductors from insulators
would be that the one could be traversed by these elec-
trons, while the others would check the movement of the
electrons. Lorentz’s theory is very attractive. It gives a
very simple explanation of certain phenomena, which the
earlier theories—even Maxwell’s in its primitive form—
could only deal with in an unsatisfactory manner; for
example, the aberration of light, the partial impulse of
luminous waves, magnetic polarisation, and Zeeman’s ex-
periment.
A few objections still remained. The phenomena of an
electric system seemed to depend on the absolute veloc-
ity of translation of the centre of gravity of this system,
which is contrary to the idea that we have of the relativ-
ity of space. Supported by M. Crémieu, M. Lippman has
presented this objection in a very striking form. Imagine
two charged conductors with the same velocity of transla-
tion. They are relatively at rest. However, each of them
being equivalent to a current of convection, they ought
to attract one another, and by measuring this attraction
we could measure their absolute velocity. “No!” replied
the partisans of Lorentz. “What we could measure in
that way is not their absolute velocity, but their relativescience and hypothesis

velocity with respect to the ether, so that the principle of
relativity is safe.” Whatever there may be in these objec-
tions, the edifice of electro-dynamics seemed, at any rate
in its broad lines, definitively constructed. Everything
was presented under the most satisfactory aspect. The
theories of Ampère and Helmholtz, which were made for
the open currents that no longer existed, seem to have
no more than purely historic interest, and the inextricable complications to which these theories led have been
almost forgotten. This quiescence has been recently disturbed by the experiments of M. Crémieu, which have contradicted, or at least have seemed to contradict, the results formerly obtained by Rowland. 

Numerous investigators have endeavoured to solve the question, and fresh
experiments have been undertaken. What result will they give? 

I shall take care not to risk a prophecy which might be falsified between the day this book is ready for the
press and the day on which it is placed before the public.
