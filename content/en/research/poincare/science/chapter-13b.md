Ampère's theory states his method of explaining the action of open currents. 
- Ampère's fundamental hypothesis is that the action of 2 elements of current reduces to a force along their join. 

I find it difficult to disregard the paradoxical and artificial character of his propositions. 

We feel bound to think “it cannot be so.” 

Helmholtz has been led to look for something else. 

He rejects the Ampere's hypothesis. 

He admits that an clement of current is not acted on by a single force but by a force and a couple. This is what gave rise to the celebrated polemic between Bertrand and Helmholtz.

Helmholtz replaces Ampère’s hypothesis:

Two elements of current always admit of an electro-dynamic potential, depending solely on their position and orientation. The work of the forces that they exercise one on the other is equal to the variation of this potential. 

Thus, Helmholtz can no more do without hypothesis than Ampère. But at least, he does not do so without explicitly announcing it.

The 2 theories agree in closed currents which are accessible only to experiment. 

In all other cases they differ. 

In the first place, contrary to what Ampère supposed, the force which seems to act on the movable portion of a closed current is not the same as that acting on the movable portion if it were isolated and if it constituted an open current. 

Let us return to the circuit C 0 , of which we spoke above, and which was formed of a mov-
able wire sliding on a fixed wire. In the only experiment
that can be made the movable portion αβ is not isolated,
but is part of a closed circuit. When it passes from AB
to A 0 B 0 , the total electro-dynamic potential varies for 2 reasons. 

1. It has a slight increment because the potential of A 0 B 0 with respect to the circuit C is not the same as that of AB;
2. It has a second increment because it must be increased by the potentials of the elements AA 0 and B 0 B with respect to C. 

It is this double increment which represents the work of the force acting upon the portion AB. 

If, on the contrary, αβ be isolated, the potential would only have the first increment, and this first increment alone would measure the work
of the force acting on AB. 

In the second place, there could be no continuous rotation without sliding contact. In fact, in closed currents, it is an immediate consequence of the existence of an electro-dynamic potential. 

In Faraday’s experiment, if the magnet is fixed, and if the part of the current external to the magnet runs along a movable wire, that movable wire may undergo continuous rotation. 

But it does not mean that, if the contacts of the wire with the magnet were suppressed, and an open current were to run along
the wire, the wire would still have a movement of continuous rotation. 

An isolated element is not acted on in the same way as a movable element making part of a closed circuit. But there is another
difference. The action of a solenoid on a closed current is zero according to experiment and according to the 2 theories. 

Its action on an open current would be zero according to Ampère, and it would not be zero according to Helmholtz. 

From this follows an important consequence.

We have given above 3 definitions of the magnetic force. 

The third has no meaning here, since an element of current is no longer acted upon by a single force. Nor
has the first any meaning. What, in fact, is a magnetic
pole? It is the extremity of an indefinite linear magnet.

This magnet may be replaced by an indefinite solenoid.

For the definition of magnetic force to have any meaning, the action exercised by an open current on an indefinite
solenoid would only depend on the position of the extremity of that solenoid—i.e., that the action of a closed
solenoid is zero. 

But this is not the case. 

On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent us from adopting the second definition which is founded on the measurement of the director couple which tends to orientate the magnetic needle; 

but, if it is adopted, neither the effects of induction nor electro-dynamic effects will depend solely on the distribution of the lines of force
in this magnetic field.

### 3. Difficulties raised by these Theories

Helmholtz’s theory is an advance on Ampère's theory. 

But every difficulty should be removed. 

In both, the name “magnetic field” has no meaning, or, if we give it one by a more or less artificial convention, the
ordinary laws so familiar to electricians no longer apply

Thus, the electro-motive force induced in a wire is no longer measured by the number of lines of force met by that wire. 

And our objections do not proceed only from the fact that it is difficult to give up
deeply-rooted habits of language and thought. 

There is something more. 

If we do not believe in actions at a distance, electro-dynamic phenomena must be explained by a modification of the medium.

This medium is the “magnetic field”. 

The electro-magnetic effects should only depend on that field.

All these difficulties come from the hypothesis of open currents.

## 4. Maxwell’s Theory

Maxwell, with a stroke of the pen, caused these difficulties to vanish. 

To him, all currents are closed currents. 

Maxwell admits that if in a dielectric, the electric field happens to vary, this dielectric becomes the seat of a particular
phenomenon acting on the galvanometer like a current and called the current of displacement. 

If, then, two conductors bearing positive and negative charges are placed in connection by means of a wire, during the discharge
there is an open current of conduction in that wire; but there are produced at the same time in the surrounding
dielectric currents of displacement which close this current of conduction. We know that Maxwell’s theory leads
to the explanation of optical phenomena which would be due to extremely rapid electrical oscillations. 

At that period such a conception was only a daring hypothesis which could be supported by no experiment. 

But after 20 years, Maxwell’s ideas received the confirmation of experiment. 

Hertz succeeded in producing systems of electric oscillations which reproduce all the properties of
light, and only differ by the length of their wave—as violet differs from red. 

In some measure he made a synthesis of light. 

Hertz has not directly proved Maxwell’s fundamental idea of the action of the current of displacement on the galvanometer. 

What he has shown directly is that electro-magnetic induction is not instantaneously propagated, as was supposed, but its
speed is the speed of light. Yet, to suppose there is no current of displacement, and that induction is with the
speed of light; or, rather, to suppose that the currents of displacement produce inductive effects, and that the in-
duction takes place instantaneously—comes to the same thing. 

This cannot be seen at the first glance, but it is proved by an analysis of which I must not even think of
giving even a summary here.

## 5. Rowland’s Experiment

But there are 2 kinds of open conduction currents. 

There are first the currents of discharge of a condenser, or of any conductor whatever. There are also cases in which the
electric charges describe a closed contour, being displaced by conduction in one part of the circuit and by convection
in the other part. 

The question might be regarded as solved for open currents of the first kind; they were closed by currents of displacement. For open currents of the
second kind the solution appeared still more simple. 

It seemed that if the current were closed it could only be by the current of convection itself. For that purpose it
was sufficient to admit that a “convection current”—i.e.,
a charged conductor in motion—could act on the gal-
vanometer. But experimental confirmation was lacking.
It appeared difficult, in fact, to obtain a sufficient inten-
sity even by increasing as much as possible the charge and
the velocity of the conductors. Rowland, an extremely
skilful experimentalist, was the first to triumph, or to seem to triumph, over these difficulties. 

A disc received a strong electro-static charge and a very high speed of rotation. 

An astatic magnetic system placed beside the disc underwent deviations. The experiment was made
twice by Rowland, once in Berlin and once at Baltimore.

It was afterwards repeated by Himstedt. 

These physicists even believed that they could announce that they
had succeeded in making quantitative measurements. 

For 20 years Rowland’s law was admitted without objection by all physicists, and, indeed, everything seemed to
confirm it. The spark certainly does produce a magnetic effect, and does it not seem extremely likely that
the spark discharged is due to particles taken from one of the electrodes and transferred to the other electrode with their charge? 

Is not the very spectrum of the spark, in which we recognise the lines of the metal of the electrode,
a proof of it? The spark would then be a real current of induction.

On the other hand, it is also admitted that in an electrolyte the electricity is carried by the ions in motion. The current in an electrolyte would therefore also be a current of convection; but it acts on the magnetic needle. 

And in the same way for cathode rays; Crookes
attributed these rays to very subtle matter charged with negative electricity and moving with very high velocity.
He looked upon them, in other words, as currents of convection. 

Now, these cathode rays are deviated by the magnet. In virtue of the principle of action and reaction, they should in their turn deviate the magnetic needle. 

It is true that Hertz believed he had proved that the cathodic rays do not carry negative electricity, and
that they do not act on the magnetic needle; but Hertz
was wrong. First of all, Perrin succeeded in collecting
the electricity carried by these rays—electricity of which
Hertz denied the existence; the German scientist appears
to have been deceived by the effects due to the action of
the X-rays, which were not yet discovered. 

Afterwards, and quite recently, the action of the cathodic rays on the
magnetic needle has been brought to light. Thus all these
phenomena looked upon as currents of convection, electric sparks, electrolytic currents, cathodic rays, act in the
same manner on the galvanometer and in conformity to Rowland’s law.


## 6. Lorentz’s Theory

According to Lorentz’s theory, currents of conduction would themselves be true convection currents. Electricity
would remain indissolubly connected with certain material particles called electrons. 

The circulation of these electrons through bodies would produce voltaic currents, and what would distinguish conductors from insulators would be that the one could be traversed by these electrons, while the others would check the movement of the
electrons. Lorentz’s theory is very attractive. 

It gives a very simple explanation of certain phenomena, which the earlier theories—even Maxwell’s in its primitive form—could only deal with in an unsatisfactory manner; for example, the aberration of light, the partial impulse of luminous waves, magnetic polarisation, and Zeeman’s experiment.

A few objections still remained. The phenomena of an electric system seemed to depend on the absolute veloc-
ity of translation of the centre of gravity of this system, which is contrary to the idea that we have of the relativity of space. Supported by M. Crémieu, M. Lippman has presented this objection in a very striking form. Imagine two charged conductors with the same velocity of translation. They are relatively at rest. However, each of them being equivalent to a current of convection, they ought
to attract one another, and by measuring this attraction we could measure their absolute velocity. “No!” replied the partisans of Lorentz. 

“What we could measure in that way is not their absolute velocity, but their relative velocity with respect to the ether, so that the principle of relativity is safe.” Whatever there may be in these objec-
tions, the edifice of electro-dynamics seemed, at any rate in its broad lines, definitively constructed. Everything was presented under the most satisfactory aspect. 

The theories of Ampère and Helmholtz, which were made for the open currents that no longer existed, seem to have no more than purely historic interest, and the inextricable complications to which these theories led have been almost forgotten. This quiescence has been recently disturbed by the experiments of M. Crémieu, which have contradicted, or at least have seemed to contradict, the results formerly obtained by Rowland. 

<!-- Numerous investigators have tried to solve the question, and fresh
experiments have been undertaken. What result will they give? 

I shall take care not to risk a prophecy which might be falsified between the day this book is ready for the
press and the day on which it is placed before the public.
