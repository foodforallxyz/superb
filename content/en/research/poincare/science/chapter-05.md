1. The principles of geometry are not experimental facts. Euclid’s postulate cannot be proved by experiment. 
<!-- However convincing the reasons already given may appear to me, I feel
I must dwell upon them, because there is a profoundly
false conception deeply rooted in many minds. -->
2. Think of a material circle, measure its radius and
circumference, and see if the ratio of the two lengths is
equal to π. What have we done? 

We have made an experiment on the properties of the matter with which this
roundness has been realised, and of which the measure
we used is made.

3. Geometry and Astronomy

The same question may also be asked in another way. If Lobatschewsky’s
geometry is true, the parallax of a very distant star will
be finite. If Riemann’s is true, it will be negative. These
are the results which seem within the reach of exper-
iment, and it is hoped that astronomical observations
may enable us to decide between the three geometries.

But what we call a straight line in astronomy is simply the path of a ray of light. If, therefore, we were to discover negative parallaxes, or to prove that all parallaxes
are higher than a certain limit, we should have a choice between two conclusions: we could give up Euclidean geometry, or modify the laws of optics, and suppose that
light is not rigorously propagated in a straight line. 

It is needless to add that every one would look upon this
solution as the more advantageous. Euclidean geometry,
therefore, has nothing to fear from fresh experiments.

4. Can we maintain that certain phenomena which are possible in Euclidean space would be impossible in non-Euclidean space, so that experiment in establishing these phenomena would directly contradict the non-Euclidean hypothesis? 

I think that such a question cannot be seriously asked. To me it is exactly equivalent to
the following, the absurdity of which is obvious:—There
are lengths which can be expressed in metres and cen-
timetres, but cannot be measured in toises, feet, and
inches; so that experiment, by ascertaining the existence
of these lengths, would directly contradict this hypothe-
sis, that there are toises divided into six feet. Let us look
at the question a little more closely. I assume that the
straight line in Euclidean space possesses any two prop-
erties, which I shall call A and B; that in non-Euclideanexperiment and geometry.

space it still possesses the property A, but no longer
possesses the property B; and, finally, I assume that
in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean space the straight
line is the only line that possesses the property A. If
this were so, experiment would be able to decide be-
tween the hypotheses of Euclid and Lobatschewsky. It
would be found that some concrete object, upon which we
can experiment—for example, a pencil of rays of light—
possesses the property A. We should conclude that it is
rectilinear, and we should then endeavour to find out if
it does, or does not, possess the property B. But it is not
so. There exists no property which can, like this prop-
erty A, be an absolute criterion enabling us to recognise
the straight line, and to distinguish it from every other
line. Shall we say, for instance, “This property will be
the following: the straight line is a line such that a figure
of which this line is a part can move without the mu-
tual distances of its points varying, and in such a way
that all the points in this straight line remain fixed”?
Now, this is a property which in either Euclidean or non-
Euclidean space belongs to the straight line, and belongs
to it alone. But how can we ascertain by experiment if
it belongs to any particular concrete object? Distances
must be measured, and how shall we know that any con-science and hypothesis
86
crete magnitude which I have measured with my material
instrument really represents the abstract distance? We
have only removed the difficulty a little farther off. In
reality, the property that I have just enunciated is not a
property of the straight line alone; it is a property of the
straight line and of distance. For it to serve as an abso-
lute criterion, we must be able to show, not only that it
does not also belong to any other line than the straight
line and to distance, but also that it does not belong to
any other line than the straight line, and to any other
magnitude than distance. Now, that is not true, and
if we are not convinced by these considerations, I chal-
lenge any one to give me a concrete experiment which
can be interpreted in the Euclidean system, and which
cannot be interpreted in the system of Lobatschewsky.
As I am well aware that this challenge will never be ac-
cepted, I may conclude that no experiment will ever be in
contradiction with Euclid’s postulate; but, on the other
hand, no experiment will ever be in contradiction with
Lobatschewsky’s postulate.
5. But it is not sufficient that the Euclidean (or non-
Euclidean) geometry can ever be directly contradicted by
experiment. Nor could it happen that it can only agree
with experiment by a violation of the principle of suffi-experiment and geometry.
87
cient reason, and of that of the relativity of space. Let me
explain myself. Consider any material system whatever.
We have to consider on the one hand the “state” of the
various bodies of this system—for example, their temper-
ature, their electric potential, etc.; and on the other hand
their position in space. And among the data which enable
us to define this position we distinguish the mutual dis-
tances of these bodies that define their relative positions,
and the conditions which define the absolute position of
the system and its absolute orientation in space. The law
of the phenomena which will be produced in this system
will depend on the state of these bodies, and on their
mutual distances; but because of the relativity and the
inertia of space, they will not depend on the absolute po-
sition and orientation of the system. In other words, the
state of the bodies and their mutual distances at any mo-
ment will solely depend on the state of the same bodies
and on their mutual distances at the initial moment, but
will in no way depend on the absolute initial position of
the system and of its absolute initial orientation. This is
what we shall call, for the sake of abbreviation, the law
of relativity.
So far I have spoken as a Euclidean geometer. But
I have said that an experiment, whatever it may be, re-science and hypothesis
88
quires an interpretation on the Euclidean hypothesis; it
equally requires one on the non-Euclidean hypothesis.
Well, we have made a series of experiments. We have
interpreted them on the Euclidean hypothesis, and we
have recognised that these experiments thus interpreted
do not violate this “law of relativity.” We now interpret
them on the non-Euclidean hypothesis. This is always
possible, only the non-Euclidean distances of our differ-
ent bodies in this new interpretation will not generally
be the same as the Euclidean distances in the primitive
interpretation. Will our experiment interpreted in this
new manner be still in agreement with our “law of rela-
tivity,” and if this agreement had not taken place, would
we not still have the right to say that experiment has
proved the falsity of non-Euclidean geometry? It is easy
to see that this is an idle fear. In fact, to apply the law
of relativity in all its rigour, it must be applied to the en-
tire universe; for if we were to consider only a part of the
universe, and if the absolute position of this part were
to vary, the distances of the other bodies of the universe
would equally vary; their influence on the part of the
universe considered might therefore increase or dimin-
ish, and this might modify the laws of the phenomena
which take place in it. But if our system is the entireexperiment and geometry.
89
universe, experiment is powerless to give us any opinion
on its position and its absolute orientation in space. All
that our instruments, however perfect they may be, can
let us know will be the state of the different parts of the
universe, and their mutual distances. Hence, our law of
relativity may be enunciated as follows:—The readings
that we can make with our instruments at any given mo-
ment will depend only on the readings that we were able
to make on the same instruments at the initial moment.
Now such an enunciation is independent of all interpre-
tation by experiments. If the law is true in the Euclidean
interpretation, it will be also true in the non-Euclidean
interpretation. Allow me to make a short digression on
this point. I have spoken above of the data which define
the position of the different bodies of the system. I might
also have spoken of those which define their velocities. I
should then have to distinguish the velocity with which
the mutual distances of the different bodies are chang-
ing, and on the other hand the velocities of translation
and rotation of the system; that is to say, the veloci-
ties with which its absolute position and orientation are
changing. For the mind to be fully satisfied, the law of
relativity would have to be enunciated as follows:—The
state of bodies and their mutual distances at any givenscience and hypothesis
90
moment, as well as the velocities with which those dis-
tances are changing at that moment, will depend only
on the state of those bodies, on their mutual distances
at the initial moment, and on the velocities with which
those distances were changing at the initial moment. But
they will not depend on the absolute initial position of
the system nor on its absolute orientation, nor on the ve-
locities with which that absolute position and orientation
were changing at the initial moment. Unfortunately, the
law thus enunciated does not agree with experiments—at
least, as they are ordinarily interpreted. Suppose a man
were translated to a planet, the sky of which was con-
stantly covered with a thick curtain of clouds, so that he
could never see the other stars. On that planet he would
live as if it were isolated in space. But he would notice
that it revolves, either by measuring its ellipticity (which
is ordinarily done by means of astronomical observations,
but which could be done by purely geodesic means), or by
repeating the experiment of Foucault’s pendulum. The
absolute rotation of this planet might be clearly shown
in this way. Now, here is a fact which shocks the philoso-
pher, but which the physicist is compelled to accept. We
know that from this fact Newton concluded the existence
of absolute space. I myself cannot accept this way ofexperiment and geometry.
91
looking at it. I shall explain why in Part III., but for the
moment it is not my intention to discuss this difficulty. I
must therefore resign myself, in the enunciation of the law
of relativity, to including velocities of every kind among
the data which define the state of the bodies. However
that may be, the difficulty is the same for both Euclid’s
geometry and for Lobatschewsky’s. I need not therefore
trouble about it further, and I have only mentioned it in-
cidentally. To sum up, whichever way we look at it, it is
impossible to discover in geometric empiricism a rational
meaning.
6. Experiments only teach us the relations of bod-
ies to one another. They do not and cannot give us the
relations of bodies and space, nor the mutual relations
of the different parts of space. “Yes!” you reply, “a sin-
gle experiment is not enough, because it only gives us
one equation with several unknowns; but when I have
made enough experiments I shall have enough equations
to calculate all my unknowns.” If I know the height of the
main-mast, that is not sufficient to enable me to calculate
the age of the captain. When you have measured every
fragment of wood in a ship you will have many equa-
tions, but you will be no nearer knowing the captain’s
age. All your measurements bearing on your fragmentsscience and hypothesis
92
of wood can tell you only what concerns those fragments;
and similarly, your experiments, however numerous they
may be, referring only to the relations of bodies with one
another, will tell you nothing about the mutual relations
of the different parts of space.

7. Will you say that if the experiments have refer-
ence to the bodies, they at least have reference to the
geometrical properties of the bodies. First, what do you
understand by the geometrical properties of bodies? I
assume that it is a question of the relations of the bodies
to space. These properties therefore are not reached by
experiments which only have reference to the relations of
bodies to one another, and that is enough to show that
it is not of those properties that there can be a ques-
tion. Let us therefore begin by making ourselves clear
as to the sense of the phrase: geometrical properties of
bodies. When I say that a body is composed of several
parts, I presume that I am thus enunciating a geometri-
cal property, and that will be true even if I agree to give
the improper name of points to the very small parts I am
considering. When I say that this or that part of a cer-
tain body is in contact with this or that part of another
body, I am enunciating a proposition which concerns the
mutual relations of the two bodies, and not their rela-experiment and geometry.

tions with space. I assume that you will agree with me
that these are not geometrical properties. I am sure that
at least you will grant that these properties are indepen-
dent of all knowledge of metrical geometry. Admitting
this, I suppose that we have a solid body formed of eight
thin iron rods, oa, ob, oc, od, oe, of , og, oh, connected
at one of their extremities, o. And let us take a second
solid body—for example, a piece of wood, on which are
marked three little spots of ink which I shall call α β γ.
I now suppose that we find that we can bring into con-
tact αβγ with ago; by that I mean α with a, and at the
same time β with g, and γ with o. Then we can suc-
cessively bring into contact αβγ with bgo, cgo, dgo, ego,
f go, then with aho, bho, cho, dho, eho, f ho; and then
αγ successively with ab, bc, cd, de, ef , f a. Now these are
observations that can be made without having any idea
beforehand as to the form or the metrical properties of
space. They have no reference whatever to the “geometri-
cal properties of bodies.” These observations will not be
possible if the bodies on which we experiment move in a
group having the same structure as the Lobatschewskian
group (I mean according to the same laws as solid bodies
in Lobatschewsky’s geometry). They therefore suffice to
prove that these bodies move according to the Euclideanscience and hypothesis

group; or at least that they do not move according to
the Lobatschewskian group. That they may be compati-
ble with the Euclidean group is easily seen; for we might
make them so if the body αβγ were an invariable solid
of our ordinary geometry in the shape of a right-angled
triangle, and if the points abcdef gh were the vertices of
a polyhedron formed of two regular hexagonal pyramids
of our ordinary geometry having abcdef as their common
base, and having the one g and the other h as their ver-
tices. Suppose now, instead of the previous observations,
we note that we can as before apply αβγ successively
to ago, bgo, cgo, dgo, ego, f go, aho, bho, cho, dho, eho,
f ho, and then that we can apply αβ (and no longer αγ)
successively to ab, bc, cd, de, ef , and f a. These are ob-
servations that could be made if non-Euclidean geometry
were true. If the bodies αβγ, oabcdef gh were invariable
solids, if the former were a right-angled triangle, and
the latter a double regular hexagonal pyramid of suit-
able dimensions. These new verifications are therefore
impossible if the bodies move according to the Euclidean
group; but they become possible if we suppose the bodies
to move according to the Lobatschewskian group. They
would therefore suffice to show, if we carried them out,
that the bodies in question do not move according to theexperiment and geometry.

Euclidean group. And so, without making any hypothe-
sis on the form and the nature of space, on the relations
of the bodies and space, and without attributing to bod-
ies any geometrical property, I have made observations
which have enabled me to show in one case that the bod-
ies experimented upon move according to a group, the
structure of which is Euclidean, and in the other case,
that they move in a group, the structure of which is Lo-
batschewskian. It cannot be said that all the first ob-
servations would constitute an experiment proving that
space is Euclidean, and the second an experiment proving
that space is non-Euclidean; in fact, it might be imagined
(note that I use the word imagined ) that there are bod-
ies moving in such a manner as to render possible the
second series of observations: and the proof is that the
first mechanic who came our way could construct it if he
would only take the trouble. But you must not conclude,
however, that space is non-Euclidean. In the same way,
just as ordinary solid bodies would continue to exist when
the mechanic had constructed the strange bodies I have
just mentioned, he would have to conclude that space
is both Euclidean and non-Euclidean. Suppose, for in-
stance, that we have a large sphere of radius R, and that
its temperature decreases from the centre to the surfacescience and hypothesis
96
of the sphere according to the law of which I spoke when I
was describing the non-Euclidean world. We might have
bodies whose dilatation is negligible, and which would
behave as ordinary invariable solids; and, on the other
hand, we might have very dilatable bodies, which would
behave as non-Euclidean solids. We might have two dou-
ble pyramids oabcdef gh and o 0 a 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e 0 f 0 g 0 h 0 , and two tri-
angles αβγ and α 0 β 0 γ 0 . The first double pyramid would
be rectilinear, and the second curvilinear. The trian-
gle αβγ would consist of undilatable matter, and the
other of very dilatable matter. We might therefore make
our first observations with the double pyramid o 0 a 0 h 0 and
the triangle α 0 β 0 γ 0 .
And then the experiment would seem to show—first,
that Euclidean geometry is true, and then that it is false.
Hence, experiments have reference not to space but to
bodies.
supplement.

8. To round the matter off, I ought to speak of a very
delicate question, which will require considerable devel-
opment; but I shall confine myself to summing up what I
have written in the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale
and in the Monist. When we say that space has threeexperiment and geometry.


dimensions, what do we mean? We have seen the impor-
tance of these “internal changes” which are revealed to
us by our muscular sensations. They may serve to char-
acterise the different attitudes of our body. Let us take
arbitrarily as our origin one of these attitudes, A. When
we pass from this initial attitude to another attitude B
we experience a series of muscular sensations, and this
series S of muscular sensations will define B. Observe,
however, that we shall often look upon two series S and S 0
as defining the same attitude B (since the initial and fi-
nal attitudes A and B remaining the same, the intermedi-
ary attitudes of the corresponding sensations may differ).
How then can we recognise the equivalence of these two
series? Because they may serve to compensate for the
same external change, or more generally, because, when
it is a question of compensation for an external change,
one of the series may be replaced by the other. Among
these series we have distinguished those which can alone
compensate for an external change, and which we have
called “displacements.” As we cannot distinguish two dis-
placements which are very close together, the aggregate
of these displacements presents the characteristics of a
physical continuum. Experience teaches us that they are
the characteristics of a physical continuum of six dimen-science and hypothesis

sions; but we do not know as yet how many dimensions
space itself possesses, so we must first of all answer an-
other question. What is a point in space? Every one
thinks he knows, but that is an illusion. What we see
when we try to represent to ourselves a point in space is
a black spot on white paper, a spot of chalk on a black-
board, always an object. The question should therefore
be understood as follows:—What do I mean when I say
the object B is at the point which a moment before was
occupied by the object A? Again, what criterion will
enable me to recognise it? I mean that although I have
not moved (my muscular sense tells me this), my finger,
which just now touched the object A, is now touching
the object B. I might have used other criteria—for in-
stance, another finger or the sense of sight—but the first
criterion is sufficient. I know that if it answers in the
affirmative all other criteria will give the same answer. I
know it from experiment. I cannot know it à priori. For
the same reason I say that touch cannot be exercised at
a distance; that is another way of enunciating the same
experimental fact. If I say, on the contrary, that sight is
exercised at a distance, it means that the criterion fur-
nished by sight may give an affirmative answer while the
others reply in the negative.experiment and geometry.

To sum up. For each attitude of my body my finger
determines a point, and it is that and that only which
defines a point in space. To each attitude corresponds
in this way a point. But it often happens that the same
point corresponds to several different attitudes (in this
case we say that our finger has not moved, but the rest of
our body has). We distinguish, therefore, among changes
of attitude those in which the finger does not move. How
are we led to this? It is because we often remark that in
these changes the object which is in touch with the finger
remains in contact with it. Let us arrange then in the
same class all the attitudes which are deduced one from
the other by one of the changes that we have thus dis-
tinguished. To all these attitudes of the same class will
correspond the same point in space. Then to each class
will correspond a point, and to each point a class. Yet it
may be said that what we get from this experiment is not
the point, but the class of changes, or, better still, the
corresponding class of muscular sensations. Thus, when
we say that space has three dimensions, we merely mean
that the aggregate of these classes appears to us with the
characteristics of a physical continuum of three dimen-
sions. Then if, instead of defining the points in space
with the aid of the first finger, I use, for example, another finger, would the results be the same? 

That is by no means à priori evident. But, as we have seen, experi-
ment has shown us that all our criteria are in agreement,
and this enables us to answer in the affirmative. If we
recur to what we have called displacements, the aggre-
gate of which forms, as we have seen, a group, we shall
be brought to distinguish those in which a finger does
not move; and by what has preceded, those are the dis-
placements which characterise a point in space, and their
aggregate will form a sub-group of our group. To each
sub-group of this kind, then, will correspond a point in
space. We might be tempted to conclude that experiment
has taught us the number of dimensions of space; but in
reality our experiments have referred not to space, but
to our body and its relations with neighbouring objects.
What is more, our experiments are exceeding crude. In
our mind the latent idea of a certain number of groups
pre-existed; these are the groups with which Lie’s theory
is concerned. 

Which shall we choose to form a kind of
standard by which to compare natural phenomena? 

When this group is chosen, which of the sub-groups shall
we take to characterise a point in space?

Experiment has guided us by showing us what choice adapts itself best to the properties of our body; but there its rôle ends.
