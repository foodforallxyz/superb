PART II. SPACE.

Every conclusion presumes premises which are either:
- obvious, or 
- can be established only if based on other propositions

We cannot go back in this way to infinity, every deductive science, and geometry in particular, must rest upon a certain number of indemonstrable axioms. 

All treatises of geometry begin therefore with the enunciation of these axioms. But there is a distinction to be drawn between them. Some of these, for example, “Things which are
equal to the same thing are equal to one another,” are not propositions in geometry but propositions in analysis. 

I look upon them as analytical à priori intuitions, and they concern me no further. But I must insist on other axioms which are special to geometry. 

Of these most treatises explicitly enunciate three:—(1) Only one line can pass through two points; (2) a straight line is the shortest distance between two points; (3) through one
point only one parallel can be drawn to a given straightnon-euclidean geometries.

line. Although we generally dispense with proving the
second of these axioms, it would be possible to deduce it
from the other two, and from those much more numer-
ous axioms which are implicitly admitted without enun-
ciation, as I shall explain further on. For a long time
a proof of the third axiom known as Euclid’s postulate
was sought in vain. 

It is impossible to imagine the efforts that have been spent in pursuit of this chimera. Finally,
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and almost
simultaneously, two scientists, a Russian and a Hungarian, Lobatschewsky and Bolyai, showed irrefutably that this proof is impossible. 

They have nearly rid us of inventors of geometries without a postulate, and ever since
the Académic des Sciences receives only about one or
two new demonstrations a year. 

But the question was not exhausted, and it was not long before a great step
was taken by the celebrated memoir of Riemann, enti-
tled: Ueber die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie zum
Grunde liegen. This little work has inspired most of the
recent treatises to which I shall later on refer, and among
which I may mention those of Beltrami and Helmholtz.


## The Geometry of Lobatschewsky

If it were possible to deduce Euclid’s postulate from the several axioms, it is evident that by rejecting the postulate and retainingscience and hypothesis the other axioms we should be led to contradictory consequences. It would be, therefore, impossible to found on those premisses a coherent geometry. 

Now, this is precisely what Lobatschewsky has done. He assumes at the outset that several parallels may be drawn through a point to a given straight line, and he retains all the other axioms of Euclid. 

From these hypotheses he deduces a series of theorems between which it is impossible to find
any contradiction, and he constructs a geometry as impeccable in its logic as Euclidean geometry. The theorems are very different, however, from those to which we are accustomed, and at first will be found a little disconcerting. 

For instance, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always less than two right angles, and the difference between that sum and two right angles is proportional to the area of the triangle. It is impossible to construct a figure similar to a given figure but of different dimensions. 

If the circumference of a circle be divided into
n equal parts, and tangents be drawn at the points of
intersection, the n tangents will form a polygon if the
radius of the circle is small enough, but if the radius is
large enough they will never meet. We need not multi-
ply these examples. Lobatschewsky’s propositions have
no relation to those of Euclid, but they are none the lessnon-euclidean geometries.

logically interconnected.


Riemann’s Geometry

Let us imagine a world only peopled with beings of no thickness, and suppose these “infinitely flat” animals are all in one and the same plane, from which they cannot emerge. 

Let us further admit that this world is sufficiently distant from other worlds to be withdrawn from their influence, and while we are making these hypotheses it will not cost us much to endow these beings with reasoning power, and to believe them capable of making a geometry. In
that case they will certainly attribute to space only two
dimensions. 

But now suppose that these imaginary animals, while remaining without thickness, have the form
of a spherical, and not of a plane figure, and are all on
the same sphere, from which they cannot escape. What
kind of a geometry will they construct? 

In the first place, it is clear that they will attribute to space only two di-
mensions. The straight line to them will be the shortest
distance from one point on the sphere to another—that
is to say, an arc of a great circle. In a word, their ge-
ometry will be spherical geometry. What they will call
space will be the sphere on which they are confined, and
on which take place all the phenomena with which they
are acquainted. 

Their space will therefore be unbounded, since on a sphere one may always walk forward without ever being brought to a stop, and yet it will be finite;

the end will never be found, but the complete tour can be made. Well, Riemann’s geometry is spherical geometry extended to three dimensions. To construct it, the
German mathematician had first of all to throw over-
board, not only Euclid’s postulate but also the first ax-
iom that only one line can pass through two points. On
a sphere, through two given points, we can in general
draw only one great circle which, as we have just seen,
would be to our imaginary beings a straight line. But
there was one exception. If the two given points are at
the ends of a diameter, an infinite number of great circles
can be drawn through them. In the same way, in Rie-
mann’s geometry—at least in one of its forms—through
two points only one straight line can in general be drawn,
but there are exceptional cases in which through two
points an infinite number of straight lines can be drawn.
So there is a kind of opposition between the geometries
of Riemann and Lobatschewsky. For instance, the sum
of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles
in Euclid’s geometry, less than two right angles in that
of Lobatschewsky, and greater than two right angles in
that of Riemann. The number of parallel lines that cannon-euclidean geometries.

be drawn through a given point to a given line is one
in Euclid’s geometry, none in Riemann’s, and an infinite
number in the geometry of Lobatschewsky. Let us add
that Riemann’s space is finite, although unbounded in
the sense which we have above attached to these words.
Surfaces with Constant Curvature.—One objection,
however, remains possible. There is no contradiction be-
tween the theorems of Lobatschewsky and Riemann; but
however numerous are the other consequences that these
geometers have deduced from their hypotheses, they had
to arrest their course before they exhausted them all, for
the number would be infinite; and who can say that if
they had carried their deductions further they would not
have eventually reached some contradiction? This dif-
ficulty does not exist for Riemann’s geometry, provided
it is limited to two dimensions. As we have seen, the
two-dimensional geometry of Riemann, in fact, does not
differ from spherical geometry, which is only a branch
of ordinary geometry, and is therefore outside all con-
tradiction. Beltrami, by showing that Lobatschewsky’s
two-dimensional geometry was only a branch of ordinary
geometry, has equally refuted the objection as far as it
is concerned. This is the course of his argument: Let us
consider any figure whatever on a surface. 

Imagine this figure to be traced on a flexible and inextensible canvas applied to the surface, in such a way that when the canvas is displaced and deformed the different lines of the figure
change their form without changing their length. 

As a rule, this flexible and inextensible figure cannot be displaced without leaving the surface. But there are certain surfaces for which such a movement would be possible.

They are surfaces of constant curvature. If we resume the comparison that we made just now, and imagine beings without thickness living on one of these surfaces, they will regard as possible the motion of a figure all the lines of which remain of a constant length. Such a
movement would appear absurd, on the other hand, to animals without thickness living on a surface of variable curvature. 

These surfaces of constant curvature are of two kinds. The curvature of some is positive, and they
may be deformed so as to be applied to a sphere. 

The geometry of these surfaces is therefore reduced to spherical geometry—namely, Riemann’s. The curvature of others is negative. 

Beltrami has shown that the geometry of these surfaces is identical with that of Lobatschewsky.
Thus the two-dimensional geometries of Riemann and
Lobatschewsky are connected with Euclidean geometry.

vanishes the objection so far as two-dimensional geome-
tries are concerned. It would be easy to extend Beltrami’s reasoning to three-dimensional geometries, and minds which do not recoil before space of four dimen-
sions will see no difficulty in it; but such minds are few
in number. 

I prefer, then, to proceed otherwise. Let us consider a certain plane, which I shall call the fundamental plane, and let us construct a kind of dictionary by
making a double series of terms written in two columns,
and corresponding each to each, just as in ordinary dic-
tionaries the words in two languages which have the same
signification correspond to one another:—
Space .............. The portion of space situated
above the fundamental
plane.
Plane .............. Sphere cutting orthogonally
the fundamental plane.
Line ...............
Circle cutting orthogonally the
fundamental plane.
Sphere ............. Sphere.
Circle .............. Circle.
Angle .............. Angle.science and hypothesis

Let us now take Lobatschewsky’s theorems and translate them by the aid of this dictionary, as we would translate a German text with the aid of a German-French dictionary. 

We shall then obtain the theorems of ordinary geometry. For instance, Lobatschewsky’s theorem: “The
sum of the angles of a triangle is less than two right angles,” may be translated thus: “If a curvilinear triangle has for its sides arcs of circles which if produced would cut orthogonally the fundamental plane, the sum of the angles of this curvilinear triangle will be less than
two right angles.” 

Thus, however far the consequences of Lobatschewsky’s hypotheses are carried, they will never
lead to a contradiction; in fact, if two of Lobatschewsky’s
theorems were contradictory, the translations of these
two theorems made by the aid of our dictionary would be
contradictory also. 

But these translations are theoremsnon-euclidean geometries.

of ordinary geometry, and no one doubts that ordinary
geometry is exempt from contradiction. Whence is the
certainty derived, and how far is it justified? That is a
question upon which I cannot enter here, but it is a very
interesting question, and I think not insoluble. Nothing,
therefore, is left of the objection I formulated above. But
this is not all. Lobatschewsky’s geometry being suscep-
tible of a concrete interpretation, ceases to be a useless
logical exercise, and may be applied. I have no time
here to deal with these applications, nor with what Herr
Klein and myself have done by using them in the inte-
gration of linear equations. Further, this interpretation is
not unique, and several dictionaries may be constructed
analogous to that above, which will enable us by a simple
translation to convert Lobatschewsky’s theorems into the
theorems of ordinary geometry.

## Implicit Axioms

Are the axioms implicitly enunciated in our text-books the only foundation of geometry?

We may be assured of the contrary when we see that,
when they are abandoned one after another, there are
still left standing some propositions which are common to
the geometries of Euclid, Lobatschewsky, and Riemann.
These propositions must be based on premisses that ge-
ometers admit without enunciation. It is interesting toscience and hypothesis

try and extract them from the classical proofs.

John Stuart Mill asserted 1 that every definition contains an axiom, because by defining we implicitly affirm the existence of the object defined. That is going rather
too far. 

It is but rarely in mathematics that a definition is given without following it up by the proof of the existence of the object defined, and when this is not done it
is generally because the reader can easily supply it; and
it must not be forgotten that the word “existence” has
not the same meaning when it refers to a mathematical
entity as when it refers to a material object.

A mathematical entity exists provided there is no contradiction implied in its definition, either in itself, or with the propositions previously admitted. But if the observa-
tion of John Stuart Mill cannot be applied to all definitions, it is none the less true for some of them. A plane is sometimes defined in the following manner:—The plane
is a surface such that the line which joins any two points
upon it lies wholly on that surface. 

There is obviously a new axiom concealed in this definition. It is true
we might change it, and that would be preferable, but
then we should have to enunciate the axiom explicitly.
Other definitions may give rise to no less important re-

flections, such as, for example, that of the equality of two
figures. Two figures are equal when they can be super-
posed. To superpose them, one of them must be displaced
until it coincides with the other. But how must it be dis-
placed? If we asked that question, no doubt we should
be told that it ought to be done without deforming it,
and as an invariable solid is displaced. The vicious circle
would then be evident. As a matter of fact, this defini-
tion defines nothing. It has no meaning to a being living
in a world in which there are only fluids. If it seems clear
to us, it is because we are accustomed to the properties
of natural solids which do not much differ from those of
the ideal solids, all of whose dimensions are invariable.
However, imperfect as it may be, this definition implies
an axiom. 

The possibility of the motion of an invariable figure is not a self-evident truth. At least it is only so in the application to Euclid’s postulate, and not as an an-
alytical à priori intuition would be. Moreover, when we
study the definitions and the proofs of geometry, we see
that we are compelled to admit without proof not only
the possibility of this motion, but also some of its prop-
erties. 

This first arises in the definition of the straight line. Many defective definitions have been given, but the
true one is that which is understood in all the proofs inscience and hypothesis

which the straight line intervenes. “It may happen that the motion of an invariable figure may be such that all the points of a line belonging to the figure are motionless, while all the points situate outside that line are in motion. 

Such a line would be called a straight line.” We have deliberately in this enunciation separated the definition from the axiom which it implies. Many proofs such as those of the cases of the equality of triangles, of the possibility of drawing a perpendicular from a point to a straight line, assume propositions the enunciations of which are dispensed with, for they necessarily imply that it is possible to move a figure in space in a certain way.
