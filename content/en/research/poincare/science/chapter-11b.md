What is the present distribution of the minor planets? 

We know that from all time they have obeyed the laws of Kepler, but we do not know what was their
initial distribution. 

In the kinetic theory of gases we assume that the gaseous molecules follow rectilinear paths
and obey the laws of impact and elastic bodies; yet as we know nothing of their initial velocities, we know nothing of their present velocities. The calculus of probabilities alone enables us to predict the mean phenomena which
will result from a combination of these velocities. 

This is the second degree of ignorance. Finally it is possible, that not only the initial conditions but the laws them-
selves are unknown. We then reach the third degree of ignorance, and in general we can no longer affirm any-
thing at all as to the probability of a phenomenon. 

It often happens that instead of trying to discover an event by means of a more or less imperfect knowledge of the
law, the events may be known, and we want to find the law; or that, instead of deducing effects from causes, we
wish to deduce the causes from the effects. 

Now, these problems are classified as probability of causes, and are the most interesting of all from their scientific applica-
tions. I play at écarté with a gentleman whom I know to be perfectly honest. 

What is the chance that he turns up the king? It is 18 . 

This is a problem of the probability of effects. I play with a gentleman whom I do not know.
He has dealt ten times, and he has turned the king up six
times. What is the chance that he is a sharper? 

This is a problem in the probability of causes. It may be said that
it is the essential problem of the experimental method. I
have observed n values of x and the corresponding values
of y. I have found that the ratio of the latter to the former
is practically constant. 

There is the event; what is the cause? 

Is it probable that there is a general law according to which y would be proportional to x, and that small
divergencies are due to errors of observation? 

This is the type of question that we are ever asking, and which we
unconsciously solve whenever we are engaged in scientific
work. I am now going to pass in review these different
categories of problems by discussing in succession what I
have called subjective and objective probability.
II. Probability in Mathematics.—The impossibility
of squaring the circle was shown in 1885, but before
that date all geometers considered this impossibility as
so “probable” that the Académie des Sciences rejected without examination the, alas! too numerous memoirs on
this subject that a few unhappy madmen sent in every year. 

Was the Académie wrong? Evidently not, and it knew perfectly well that by acting in this manner it did
not run the least risk of stifling a discovery of moment.

The Académie could not have proved that it was right, but it knew quite well that its instinct did not deceive
it. If you had asked the Academicians, they would have answered: “We have compared the probability that an
unknown scientist should have found out what has been vainly sought for so long, with the probability that there
is one madman the more on the earth, and the latter
has appeared to us the greater.” These are very good
reasons, but there is nothing mathematical about them;
they are purely psychological. If you had pressed them
further, they would have added: “Why do you expect a
particular value of a transcendental function to be an
algebraical number; if π be the root of an algebraical
equation, why do you expect this root to be a period
of the function sin 2x, and why is it not the same with
the other roots of the same equation?” To sum up, they
would have invoked the principle of sufficient reason in
its vaguest form. Yet what information could they draw
from it? 

At most a rule of conduct for the employment of their time, which would be more usefully spent at their ordinary work than in reading a lucubration that inspired in them a legitimate distrust. 

But what I called above objective probability has nothing in common with
this first problem. It is otherwise with the second. Let
us consider the first 10, 000 logarithms that we find in
a table. Among these 10, 000 logarithms I take one at
random. What is the probability that its third decimal
is an even number? You will say without any hesitation
that the probability is 12 , and in fact if you pick out in
a table the third decimals in these 10, 000 numbers you
will find nearly as many even digits as odd. Or, if you
prefer it, let us write 10, 000 numbers corresponding to
our 10, 000 logarithms, writing down for each of these
numbers +1 if the third decimal of the corresponding
logarithm is even, and −1 if odd; and then let us take
the mean of these 10, 000 numbers. I do not hesitate
to say that the mean of these 10, 000 units is probably
zero, and if I were to calculate it practically, I would
verify that it is extremely small. But this verification is
needless. I might have rigorously proved that this mean
is smaller than 0.003. To prove this result I should have
had to make a rather long calculation for which there is
no room here, and for which I may refer the reader toscience and hypothesis
216
an article that I published in the Revue générale des Sci-
ences, April 15th, 1899. The only point to which I wish
to draw attention is the following. In this calculation I
had occasion to rest my case on only two facts—namely,
that the first and second derivatives of the logarithm re-
main, in the interval considered, between certain limits.
Hence our first conclusion is that the property is not
only true of the logarithm but of any continuous func-
tion whatever, since the derivatives of every continuous
function are limited. If I was certain beforehand of the
result, it is because I have often observed analogous facts
for other continuous functions; and next, it is because I
went through in my mind in a more or less unconscious
and imperfect manner the reasoning which led me to
the preceding inequalities, just as a skilled calculator
before finishing his multiplication takes into account
what it ought to come to approximately. And besides,
since what I call my intuition was only an incomplete
summary of a piece of true reasoning, it is clear that
observation has confirmed my predictions, and that the
objective and subjective probabilities are in agreement.
As a third example I shall choose the following:—The
number u is taken at random and n is a given very large
integer. What is the mean value of sin nu? This problemthe calculus of probabilities.
217
has no meaning by itself. To give it one, a convention is
required—namely, we agree that the probability for the
number u to lie between a and a + da is φ(a) da; that it is
therefore proportional to the infinitely small interval da,
and is equal to this multiplied by a function φ(a), only
depending on a. As for this function I choose it arbitrar-
ily, but I must assume it to be continuous. The value
of sin nu remaining the same when u increases by 2π, I
may without loss of generality assume that u lies between
0 and 2π, and I shall thus be led to suppose that φ(a) is
a periodic function whose period is 2π. The mean value
that we seek is readily expressed by a simple integral,
and it is easy to show that this integral is smaller than
2πM K
,
n K
M K being the maximum value of the Kth derivative
of φ(u). We see then that if the Kth derivative is finite,
our mean value will tend towards zero when n increases
1
indefinitely, and that more rapidly than K+1 .
n
The mean value of sin nu when n is very large is there-
fore zero. To define this value I required a convention,
but the result remains the same whatever that convention
may be. I have imposed upon myself but slight restric-science and hypothesis
218
tions when I assumed that the function φ(a) is continuous
and periodic, and these hypotheses are so natural that we
may ask ourselves how they can be escaped. Examina-
tion of the three preceding examples, so different in all
respects, has already given us a glimpse on the one hand
of the rôle of what philosophers call the principle of suffi-
cient reason, and on the other hand of the importance of
the fact that certain properties are common to all contin-
uous functions. The study of probability in the physical
sciences will lead us to the same result.
III. Probability in the Physical Sciences.—We now
come to the problems which are connected with what
I have called the second degree of ignorance—namely,
those in which we know the law but do not know the ini-
tial state of the system. I could multiply examples, but
I shall take only one. What is the probable present dis-
tribution of the minor planets on the zodiac? We know
they obey the laws of Kepler. We may even, without
changing the nature of the problem, suppose that their
orbits are circular and situated in the same plane, a plane
which we are given. On the other hand, we know abso-
lutely nothing about their initial distribution. However,
we do not hesitate to affirm that this distribution is now
nearly uniform. Why? Let b be the longitude of a minorthe calculus of probabilities.
219
planet in the initial epoch—that is to say, the epoch zero.
Let a be its mean motion. Its longitude at the present
time—i.e., at the time t will be at + b. To say that the
present distribution is uniform is to say that the mean
value of the sines and cosines of multiples of at + b is
zero. Why do we assert this? Let us represent our minor
planet by a point in a plane—namely, the point whose
co-ordinates are a and b. All these representative points
will be contained in a certain region of the plane, but
as they are very numerous this region will appear dotted
with points. We know nothing else about the distribu-
tion of the points. Now what do we do when we apply
the calculus of probabilities to such a question as this?
What is the probability that one or more representative
points may be found in a certain portion of the plane?
In our ignorance we are compelled to make an arbitrary
hypothesis. To explain the nature of this hypothesis I
may be allowed to use, instead of a mathematical for-
mula, a crude but concrete image. Let us suppose that
over the surface of our plane has been spread imaginary
matter, the density of which is variable, but varies con-
tinuously. We shall then agree to say that the probable
number of representative points to be found on a cer-
tain portion of the plane is proportional to the quantityscience and hypothesis
220
of this imaginary matter which is found there. If there
are, then, two regions of the plane of the same extent,
the probabilities that a representative point of one of our
minor planets is in one or other of these regions will be
as the mean densities of the imaginary matter in one or
other of the regions. Here then are two distributions, one
real, in which the representative points are very numer-
ous, very close together, but discrete like the molecules of
matter in the atomic hypothesis; the other remote from
reality, in which our representative points are replaced by
imaginary continuous matter. We know that the latter
cannot be real, but we are forced to adopt it through our
ignorance. If, again, we had some idea of the real distri-
bution of the representative points, we could arrange it so
that in a region of some extent the density of this imag-
inary continuous matter may be nearly proportional to
the number of representative points, or, if it is preferred,
to the number of atoms which are contained in that re-
gion. Even that is impossible, and our ignorance is so
great that we are forced to choose arbitrarily the func-
tion which defines the density of our imaginary matter.
We shall be compelled to adopt a hypothesis from which
we can hardly get away; we shall suppose that this func-
tion is continuous. That is sufficient, as we shall see, tothe calculus of probabilities.
221
enable us to reach our conclusion.
What is at the instant t the probable distribution of
the minor planets—or rather, what is the mean value
of the sine of the longitude at the moment t—i.e., of
sin(at + b)? We made at the outset an arbitrary conven-
tion, but if we adopt it, this probable value is entirely
defined. Let us decompose the plane into elements of
surface. Consider the value of sin(at + b) at the centre
of each of these elements. Multiply this value by the
surface of the element and by the corresponding density
of the imaginary matter. Let us then take the sum for
all the elements of the plane. This sum, by definition,
will be the probable mean value we seek, which will thus
be expressed by a double integral. It may be thought
at first that this mean value depends on the choice of
the function φ which defines the density of the imagi-
nary matter, and as this function φ is arbitrary, we can,
according to the arbitrary choice which we make, ob-
tain a certain mean value. But this is not the case. A
simple calculation shows us that our double integral de-
creases very rapidly as t increases. Thus, I cannot tell
what hypothesis to make as to the probability of this or
that initial distribution, but when once the hypothesis is
made the result will be the same, and this gets me outscience and hypothesis
222
of my difficulty. Whatever the function φ may be, the
mean value tends towards zero as t increases, and as the
minor planets have certainly accomplished a very large
number of revolutions, I may assert that this mean value
is very small. I may give to φ any value I choose, with
one restriction: this function must be continuous; and,
in fact, from the point of view of subjective probability,
the choice of a discontinuous function would have been
unreasonable. What reason could I have, for instance, for
supposing that the initial longitude might be exactly 0 ◦ ,
but that it could not lie between 0 ◦ and 1 ◦ ?
The difficulty reappears if we look at it from the point
of view of objective probability; if we pass from our imag-
inary distribution in which the supposititious matter was
assumed to be continuous, to the real distribution in
which our representative points are formed as discrete
atoms. The mean value of sin(at + b) will be represented
quite simply by
1 X
sin(at + b),
n
n being the number of minor planets. Instead of a double
integral referring to a continuous function, we shall have
a sum of discrete terms. However, no one will seriously
doubt that this mean value is practically very small. Ourthe calculus of probabilities.
223
representative points being very close together, our dis-
crete sum will in general differ very little from an integral.
An integral is the limit towards which a sum of terms
tends when the number of these terms is indefinitely in-
creased. If the terms are very numerous, the sum will
differ very little from its limit—that is to say, from the
integral, and what I said of the latter will still be true of
the sum itself. But there are exceptions. If, for instance,
π
− at, the longitude of
for all the minor planets b =
2
π
all the planets at the time t would be , and the mean
2
value in question would be evidently unity. For this to
be the case at the time 0, the minor planets must have
all been lying on a kind of spiral of peculiar form, with
its spires very close together. All will admit that such an
initial distribution is extremely improbable (and even if
it were realised, the distribution would not be uniform at
the present time—for example, on the 1st January 1900;
but it would become so a few years later). Why, then, do
we think this initial distribution improbable? This must
be explained, for if we are wrong in rejecting as improb-
able this absurd hypothesis, our inquiry breaks down,
and we can no longer affirm anything on the subject of
the probability of this or that present distribution. Oncescience and hypothesis
224
more we shall invoke the principle of sufficient reason, to
which we must always recur. We might admit that at
the beginning the planets were distributed almost in a
straight line. We might admit that they were irregularly
distributed. But it seems to us that there is no sufficient
reason for the unknown cause that gave them birth to
have acted along a curve so regular and yet so compli-
cated, which would appear to have been expressly chosen
so that the distribution at the present day would not be
uniform.
