<!-- COMPENDIUM ON CALCULATING BY COMPLETION AND REDUCTION, -->

People always want a number when calculating. Every number is composed of units. Any number can be divided into units. 

Every number, which may be expressed from one to ten, surpasses the preceding by one unit. Afterwards, the ten is doubled or tripled, just as before the units were. Thus arise 20, 30, until 100. The 100 is doubled and tripled in the same way up to 1,000, and so on without limit. 

There are three kinds of numbers in calculations= 

1. roots - any quantity multiplied by itself
2. squares - the result of the roots when multiplied
3. simple numbers that are not root nor square

A number belonging to one of these three may be equal to a number of another class. For example, a square equal to a root, or a root equal to a square.  

An example of squares equal to roots= 
- A square is equal to 5 roots.
- The root of the square is 5
- The square is 25, which is 5 times its root

If you say "1/3 of the square is equal to 4 roots"= 
- The whole square is equal to 12 roots
- 144 is the square and its root is 12

If you say "5 squares are equal to 10 roots" then= 
- 1 square is equal to 2 roots
- The root of the square is 2
- Its square is 4



In this way, whether the squares be many or few, multiplied or divided by any number), they are reduced to a single square and the same is done with the roots, which are their equivalents i.e. they are reduced in the same proportion as the squares.



As to the case in
