## 1. Reactionary Socialism

### A. Feudal Socialism

The French and English aristocracies wrote pamphlets against modern capitalist society. 
- They fell to capitalism in the:
  - French Revolution of July 1830, and
  - the English reform agitation[A]
- This ended any hope of serious political struggle
  - Only a literary battle remained possible. 

<!-- But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.(1) -->

In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy sided with the people. 
- This led to feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon
<!--  was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate their indictment against the capitalists in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe. -->
  - It struck ineffectively against capitalists 

<!-- In this way arose ; half an echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the capitalists to the very heart’s core; but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history. -->

<!-- The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter. -->

This was done by:
- one section of the French Legitimists
- “Young England” 

In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the capitalists, the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated. 

In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern capitalists is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.

For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the capitalist amounts to this, that under the capitalist régime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.

What they upbraid the capitalists with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.

In political practice, therefore, they join in all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and honour, for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.(2)

As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.

Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.


### B. Sismondi's Petty-Capitalist Socialism

<!-- The feudal aristocracy was not the only class ruined by the capitalists, not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern capitalist society.  -->

The medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern capitalists. 
- In undeveloped countries, these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising capitalists.
- In developed countries, these led to the Petty-Capitalist, a supplementary part of capitalist society
  - These fluctuate between proletariat and capitalists, and are ruined by the real capitalists. 
<!--  which are but little developed, industrially and commercially,  -->

<!-- In countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty capitalist has been formed, , and ever renewing itself .  -->

<!-- The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen. -->

In countries like France, peasants make up far more than half of the population. 
- It was natural for pro-proletariat writers to use the flag of the peasant and the petty-capitalist

<!-- , and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels for the working class.  -->

This led to petty-capitalist Socialism. 
- Sismondi was the head of this school in France and in England.
- It dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production. 
- It laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists. 

It proved:
- the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour
- the concentration of capital and land in a few hands
- overproduction and crises

It pointed out:
- the inevitable ruin of the petty capitalist and peasant
- the misery of the proletariat
- the anarchy in production
- the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth
- the industrial war of extermination between nations
- the dissolution of old moral bonds of the old family relations and the old nationalities.

In aims, however, either to:
- restore the old means of production and exchange, and with them the old property relations and the old society, or
- cramp the modern means of production and exchange within the framework of the old property relations

<!--  that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. --> 

In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.

Its last words are: "corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations in agriculture".

Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts were removed of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues.


## C. German or “True” Socialism

The Socialist and Communist literature of France began as a fight against the capitalists in power. 
- This literature was introduced into Germany when the German capitalists had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.

German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits (men of letters), eagerly seized on this literature. 
- They forgot that when these writings came from French social conditions which did not immigrate with them. 

Under German social conditions, this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance.
- It became purely literary. 

Thus, to the German philosophers of the 18th Century:
- the demands of the first French Revolution were just the demands of “Practical Reason” in general
- the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French capitalists signified, to them, the laws of pure Will, as true human Will generally.

<!-- The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view. -->

This annexation happened in the same way that a foreign language is appropriated by translation.

<!-- It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati reversed this process with the profane French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic functions of money, they wrote “Alienation of Humanity”, and beneath the French criticism of the capitalist state they wrote “Dethronement of the Category of the General”, and so forth. -->

The introduction of French philosophical phrases<!--  at the back of the French historical criticisms -->, the Germans dubbed as:
- “Philosophy of Action”
- “True Socialism”
- “German Science of Socialism”
- “Philosophical Foundation of Socialism”, etc.

The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated. 

<!-- And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome “French one-sidedness” and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.

This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence. -->

Instead of it, the fight of <!-- the Germans, and especially of --> the Prussian capitalists against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, became more earnest. 
- This was the liberal movement.

<!-- By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to  Socialism of confronting the political movement with  -->

The “True” Socialist demands were: 
- fighting liberalism
- going against representative government
- going against capitalism
<!--  competition and capitalist freedom of the press, capitalist legislation, capitalist liberty and equality, and of  -->
- preaching to the masses that they had everything to lose from this capitalist movement. 

German Socialism was the silly echo of Feudal French anti-capitalism. 

 criticism, whose  it was, presupposed the existence of modern capitalist society, with its corresponding economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.

To the absolute governments, True Socialism served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening capitalists.

<!-- It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German working-class risings. -->

The monarchial government used this “True” Socialism as a weapon against the German capitalists. 

 it, at the same time, directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of German Philistines. 

In Germany, the petty-capitalist class was a relic of the 16th century. Since then, it had constantly cropped up under the various forms. It is the real social cause of the existing state of things.

To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. 

The industrial and political supremacy of the capitalists threatens Germany with certain destruction either by:
- the concentration of capital, or
- the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. 

“True” Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.

<!-- The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their sorry “eternal truths”, all skin and bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public. -->

German Socialism recognised gradually its own calling as the bombastic representative of petty-capitalism.
- It proclaimed:
  - Germany as the model nation
  - the German petty-capitalist as the typical man. 

<!-- To every villainous meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly opposing the “brutally destructive” tendency of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.(3) -->

 

## 2. Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism


A part of the capitalists is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of capitalist society.

To this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.

We may cite Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère as an example of this form.

The Socialistic capitalist want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a capitalists without a proletariat. The capitalists naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and capitalist Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the capitalists.

A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the capitalist relations of production, an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of capitalist government.

Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.

Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of capitalist socialism.

It is summed up in the phrase: the capitalist is a capitalist — for the benefit of the working class.

 

3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism
We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.

The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown, necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending capitalist epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.

The Socialist and Communist systems, properly so called, those of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, and others, spring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between proletariat and capitalists (see Section 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians).

The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement.

Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws, that are to create these conditions.

Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action; historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones; and the gradual, spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of society especially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.

In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.

The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without the distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society?

Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel.

Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic conception of its own position, correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.

But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence, they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures proposed in them — such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the function of the state into a more superintendence of production — all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.

The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore, although the originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of founding isolated “phalansteres”, of establishing “Home Colonies”, or setting up a “Little Icaria”(4) — duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem — and to realise all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the capitalist. By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or] conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science.

They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class; such action, according to them, can only result from blind unbelief in the new Gospel.

The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose the Chartists and the Réformistes.

Chapter 4: Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties

(1) Not the English Restoration (1660-1689), but the French Restoration (1814-1830). [Note by Engels to the English edition of 1888.]

(2) This applies chiefly to Germany, where the landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for their own account by stewards, and are, moreover, extensive beetroot-sugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits. The wealthier British aristocracy are, as yet, rather above that; but they, too, know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to floaters or more or less shady joint-stock companies. [Note by Engels to the English edition of 1888.]

(3) The revolutionary storm of 1848 swept away this whole shabby tendency and cured its protagonists of the desire to dabble in socialism. The chief representative and classical type of this tendency is Mr Karl Gruen. [Note by Engels to the German edition of 1890.]

(4) Phalanstéres were Socialist colonies on the plan of Charles Fourier; Icaria was the name given by Cabet to his Utopia and, later on, to his American Communist colony. [Note by Engels to the English edition of 1888.]

“Home Colonies” were what Owen called his Communist model societies. Phalanstéres was the name of the public palaces planned by Fourier. Icaria was the name given to the Utopian land of fancy, whose Communist institutions Cabet portrayed. [Note by Engels to the German edition of 1890.]

[A] A reference to the movement for a reform of the electoral law which, under the pressure of the working class, was passed by the British House of Commons in 1831 and finally endorsed by the House of Lords in June, 1832. The reform was directed against monopoly rule of the landed and finance aristocracy and opened the way to Parliament for the representatives of the industrial capitalists. Neither workers nor the petty-capitalist were allowed electoral rights, despite assurances they would.
