Through the intervention of Tsz-lu, Tsz-kau was being appointed governor of Pi. 

"You are spoiling a good man's son," said the Master. 

Tsz-lu rejoined, "But he will have the people and their superiors to gain experience from, and there will be the altars; what need to read books? 

He can become a student afterwards." "Here is the reason for my hatred of glib-tongued people," said the Master. 

---

Tsz-lu, Tsang Sin, Yen Yu, and Kung-si Hwa were sitting near him. He said to them= 

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Though I may be a day older than you, do not (for the moment) regard me as such. While you are living this unoccupied life you are saying, 'We do not become known.' Now suppose some one got to know you, what then?"
{{< /l >}}

Tsz-lu was first to speak= 

<div class="right tsz-lu">
Give me a State of large size and armament, hemmed in and hampered by other larger States, the population augmented by armies and regiments, causing a dearth in it of food of all kinds; give me charge of that State, and in three years' time I should make a brave country of it, and let it know its place.
</div>


The Master smiled at him, then asked the same question to Yen.

<div class="right yen-yu">
Give me a charge of a territory of 60 li square. In three years I should make the people sufficiently prosperous. As regards their knowledge of ceremonial or music, I should wait for superior men to teach them that.
</div>

He then asked Kung-si.

<div class="right kung-si">
I have nothing to say about my capabilities for such matters; my wish is to learn.  I should like to be a junior assistant, in dark robe and cap, at the services of the ancestral temple, and at the Grand Receptions of the Princes by the Sovereign.
</div>

He then asked Tsang Sin who was strumming on his harpsichord, but now the twanging ceased, he turned from the instrument, rose to his feet, and answered=  

<div class="right tsang-sin">
Something different from the choice of these three.
</div>

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
I want each one of you to tell me what his heart is set upon.
{{< /l >}}

<div class="right tsang-sin">
Well then, give me in the latter part of spring dressed in full spring-tide attire�in company with five or six young fellows of 20*, or six or seven lads under that age, to do the ablutions in the I stream, enjoy a breeze in the rain-dance**,  and finish up with songs on the road home.
</div>

> *Lit., capped ones. At twenty they underwent the ceremony of capping, and were considered men.

> **I.e., before the altars, where offerings were placed with prayer for rain. A religious dance.] 


The Master sighed and exclaimed, "Ah, I take with you!"

The three other disciples having gone out, leaving Tsang Sin behind

<div class="right tsang-sin">
What think you of the answers of those three?" 
</div>

<div class="left conf">
"Well, each told me what was uppermost in his mind," said the Master;"simply that." 
</div>

<div class="right tsang-sin">
"Why did you smile at Tsz-lu, sir?" 
</div>

<div class="left conf">
I smiled at him because to have the charge of a State requires due regard to the Rules of Propriety, and his words betrayed a lack of modesty." 
</div>

<div class="right tsang-sin">
"But Yen, then he had a State in view, had he not?" 
</div>

<div class="left conf">
"I should like to be shown a territory such as he described which does not amount to a State." 
</div>

<div class="right tsang-sin">
"But had not Kung-si also a State in view?" 
</div>

<div class="left conf">
What are ancestral temples and Grand Receptions, but for the feudal lords to take part in? If Kung-si were to become an unimportant assistant at these functions, who could become an important one?" 
</div>
