The Chief of the Ki family was a wealthier man than the Duke of Chow had been, and yet Yen Yu gathered and hoarded for him, increasing his wealth more and more. 

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
"He is no follower of mine. It would serve him right, my children, to sound the drum, and set upon him." 

As for the characteristics of the four disciples=  

Tsz-ku was simple-minded; 

Tsang Si, a dullard; 

Tsz-chang, full of airs; Tsz-lu, rough, Hwi comes near to perfection, while frequently in great want. 

Tsz-kung does not submit to the appointments of Heaven; and yet his goods are increased;ï¿½he is often successful in his calculations.

What are some marks of the naturally Good Man?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
He does not walk in others' footprints, yet he does not get beyond the hall into the house."
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
A man's words have something genuine in them, are they necessarily those of a superior man? or words carrying only an outward semblance and show of gravity?" 
{{< /l >}}

Tsz-lu asked about the practice of precepts one has heard. 

{{< r a="Tsz-lu" >}}
In a case where there is a father or elder brother still left with you, how should you practise all you hear?" (Yen Yu also asked him this question to which he replied)
{{< /r >}} 

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
"Yes, do so." 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Kung-si" >}}
Tsz-lu asked you, sir, about the practice of what one has learnt. You said that There may be a father or elder brother still alive. But when Yen Yu asked the same question, you answered, 'Yes, do so.' I am at a loss to understand you, and venture to ask what you meant." 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
Yen Yu backs out of his duties; therefore I push him on. Tsz-lu has forwardness enough for them both; therefore I hold him back."
{{< /l >}}

On the occasion of that time of fear in K'wang, Yen Yuen having fallen behind, the Master said to him (afterwards), "I took it for granted you were a dead man." "How should I dare to die," said he, "while you, sir, still lived?"

Are Tsz-lu and Yen Yu "great ministers"?
</div> 


{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
'Great ministers' are those who serve their prince conscientiously. They retire when they cannot do so. They may be called 'qualified ministers.' 
{{< /l >}}


<div class="right ki-tsz-jen">
Are they the kind that will follow their leader?
</div>

{{< l a="Confucius" >}}
They would not follow him who should slay his father and his prince!
