## Relativity 

How does my theory of relativity relate to philosophy?

Reichenbach has precise deductions and sharp assertions. 

Robertson’s lucid discussion also is interesting mainly from the standpoint of general epistemology, although it limits itself to the narrower theme of “the theory of relativity and geometry.” 

{{< r ava="Robertson" >}}
Is Reichenbach's assertion true? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="einstein" >}}
I answer with Pilate’s famous question: “What is truth?” Is a geometry — looked at from the physical point of view — verifiable or not? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="Reichenbach and Helmholtz" >}}
Yes, provided that the empirically given solid body realises the concept of “distance.” Poincare says  and consequently is condemned by Reichenbach. 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Poincare" >}}
No. The bodies are not rigid. Consequently, they cannot embody geometric intervals. Therefore, the theorems of geometry are not verifiable.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r ava="Reichenbach" >}}
Bodies cannot be immediately adduced for the “real definition” of the space. Nevertheless, this real definition can be achieved by taking the thermal volume-dependence, elasticity, electro- and magnetostriction, etc., into consideration. This is demonstrated by classical physics.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Poincare" >}}
In gaining the real definition improved by yourself you have made use of physical laws, the formulation of which presupposes (in this case) Euclidean geometry. 

The verification, of which you have spoken, refers, therefore, not merely to geometry but to the entire system of physical laws which constitute its foundation. 

An examination of geometry by itself is consequently not thinkable.

Why should it consequently not be entirely up to me to choose geometry according to my own convenience (i.e., Euclidean) and to fit the remaining (in the usual sense “physical”) laws to this choice in such manner that there can arise no contradiction of the whole with experience?
{{< /l >}}


I replace Poincare with a non-positivist because Poincare does not want me putting words in his mouth<!--  ’s superiority as thinker and author does not permit it; in what follows therefore, an anonymous  is substituted for Poincare. — ) -->


{{< r ava="Reichenbach" >}}
<!-- There is something quite attractive in this conception. But, on the other hand, it is noteworthy that the --> But the objective meaning of length and physical distances <!-- the interpretation of the differences of co-ordinates as distances (in pre-relativistic physics) --> has not led to complications. We can thus use <!-- Should we not, on the basis of this astounding fact, be justified in operating further at least tentatively with --> the concept of the measurable length, as <!-- if there were such things as --> rigid measuring-rods. It is impossible for Einstein to create the theory of general relativity without the objective meaning of length.

Against Poincare’s suggestion, the important thing is the greatest possible simplicity of <!-- the geometry alone, but rather the greatest possible simplicity --> all of physics, inclusive of geometry. This is why we must reject his suggestion to adhere to Euclidean geometry.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l ava="Non-Positivist" >}}
If distance is be a legitimate concept, how then is it with your basic principle (meaning = verifiability)? 

Do you not have to reach the point where you must deny the meaning of geometrical concepts and theorems and to acknowledge meaning only within the completely developed theory of relativity (which, however, does not yet exist at all as a finished product)? 

Do you not have to admit that, in your sense of the word, no “meaning” can be attributed to the individual concepts and assertions of a physical theory at all, and to the entire system only insofar as it makes what is given in experience “intelligible?” 

Why do the individual concepts which occur in a theory require any specific Justification anyway, if they are only indispensable within the framework of the logical structure of the theory, and the theory only in its entirety validates itself?
{{< /l >}}


It seems to me, moreover, that you have not at all done justice to the really significant philosophical achievement of Kant. 

From Hume, Kant had learned that there are concepts (as, for example, that of causal connection), which play a dominating role in our thinking, and which, nevertheless, can not be deduced by means of a logical process from the empirically given (a fact which several empiricists recognise, it is true, but seem always again to forget). 

What justifies the use of such concepts? 


{{< l ava="Non-Positivist" >}}
Thinking is necessary in order to understand the empirically given, and concepts and “categories” are necessary as indispensable elements of thinking. If he had remained satisfied with this type of an answer, he would have avoided scepticism and you would not have been able to find fault with him.
{{< /l >}}


{{< l ava="einstein" >}}
You are misled by the erroneous opinion, difficult to avoid in your time — that Euclidean geometry is necessary to thinking and offers assured (i.e., not dependent on sensory experience) knowledge on objects. 

From this easily understandable error, you concluded the existence of synthetic judgments a priori*, which are produced by the reason alone, and which, consequently, can lay claim to absolute validity. 
{{< /l >}}


> *Superphysics Note=  active-thinking judgements confined-to-the-mind



{{< l ava="einstein" >}}
I think your censure is directed less against Kant himself than against those who today still adhere to the errors of “synthetic judgments a priori.”

<!-- I can hardly think of anything more stimulating as the basis for discussion in an epistemological seminar than this brief essay by Reichenbach (best taken together with Robertson’s essay). -->

The above is closely related to Bridgman’s essay. <!-- , so that it will be possible for me to express myself quite briefly without having to harbour too much fear that I shall be misunderstood. --> In order to be able to consider a logical system as physical theory, it is not necessary to demand that all of its assertions can be independently interpreted and “tested” “operationally;” de facto this has never yet been achieved by any theory and can not at all be achieved. 

In order to be able to consider a theory as a physical theory it is only necessary that it implies empirically testable assertions in general.

This formulation is insofar entirely unprecise as “testability” is a quality which refers not merely to the assertion itself but also to the co-ordination of concepts, contained in it, with experience. But it is probably hardly necessary for me to enter upon a discussion of this ticklish problem, inasmuch as it is not likely that there exist any essential differences of opinion at this point.



Margenau's essay says that my position contains features of rationalism and extreme empiricism. It's correct. 


This remark is entirely correct. From whence comes this fluctuation? A logical conceptual system is physics insofar as its concepts and assertions are necessarily brought into relationship with the world of experiences. 

Whoever desires to set up such a system will find a dangerous obstacle in arbitrary choice (embarras de richesse). This is why he seeks to connect his concepts as directly and necessarily as possible with the world of experience. 

In this case, his attitude is empirical. 

This path is often fruitful, but it is always open to doubt, because the specific concept and the individual assertion can, after all, assert something confronted by the empirically given only in connection with the entire system. 

He then recognises that there exists no logical path from the empirically given to that conceptual world. His attitude becomes then more nearly rationalistic, because he recognises the logical independence of the system. The danger in this attitude lies in the fact that in the search for the system one can lose every contact with the world of experience. A wavering between these extremes appears to me unavoidable.

I did not grow up in the Kantian tradition, but I found what is truly valuable in Kant's doctrine=  "The real is not given to us, but put to us (aufgegeben) (by way of a riddle)."

It means that we have a conceptual construction for grasping the inter-personal. The authority of this construction is purely in its validation.  This conceptual construction refers precisely to the “real” (by definition). **Every further question on the “nature of the real” appears empty.**


I am not convinced by Margenau's Section 4. 

It is clear that every magnitude and every assertion of a theory lays claim to “objective meaning” (within the framework of the theory). 

A problem arises only when we ascribe group-characteristics to a theory, i.e., if we assume or postulate that the same physical situation admits of several ways of description, each of which is to be viewed as equally justified. For in this case we obviously cannot ascribe complete objective meaning (for example the x-component of the velocity of a particle or its x-coordinates) to the individual (not eliminable) magnitudes. 

In this case, which has always existed in physics, we have to limit ourselves to ascribing objective meaning to the general laws of the theory, i.e., we have to demand that these laws are valid for every description of the system which is recognised as justified by the group. 

It is, therefore, not true that “objectivity” presupposes a group-characteristic, but that the group-characteristic forces a refinement of the concept of objectivity. The positing of group characteristics is heuristically so important for theory, because this characteristic always considerably limits the variety of the mathematically meaningful laws.

Now there follows a claim that the group-characteristics determine that the laws must have the form of differential equations; I can not at all see this. 

Then Margenau insists that the laws expressed by way of the differential equations (especially the partial ones) are “least specific.” Upon what does he base this contention? If they could be proved to be correct, it is true that the attempt to ground physics upon differential equations would then turn out to be hopeless. 

We are, however, far from being able to judge whether differential laws of the type to be considered have any solutions at all which are everywhere singularity-free; and, if so, whether there are too many such solutions.


## Einstein-Podolski-Rosen Paradox.

The orthodox quantum position states that the time-function characterises the individual system exhaustively. Margenau’s defence of this does not hit the essential aspects. 

Niels Bohr is an  “orthodox” quantum theoretician who does justice to the problem.

{{< quote >}}
If the partial systems A and B form a total system described by its Psi-function Psi/(AB), there is no reason why any mutually independent existence (state of reality) should be ascribed to the partial systems A and B viewed separately, not even if the partial systems are spatially separated from each other at the particular time under consideration. 

The assertion that, in this latter case, the real situation of B could not be (directly) influenced by any measurement taken on A is, therefore, within the framework of quantum theory, unfounded and (as the paradox shows) unacceptable.
{{< /quote >}}


This view at the matter means that the paradox forces us to relinquish one of the two assertions= 

1. The description by means of the Psi-function is complete
2. The real states of spatially separated objects are independent of each other

On the other hand, it is possible to adhere to (2), if one regards the Psi-function as the description of a (statistical) ensemble of systems (and therefore relinquishes (1) ). 

However, this view blasts the framework of the “orthodox quantum theory.”

Margenau correctly says that quantum mechanics on the classical level it corresponds to ordinary dynamics.

<!-- This is entirely correct — cum grano salis; and it is precisely this granum salis which is significant for the question of interpretation. -->

If our concern is with macroscopic masses (billiard balls or stars), we are operating with very short de Broglie-waves, which are determinative for the behaviour of the center of gravity of such masses. 

This why it is possible to arrange the quantum-theoretical description for a reasonable time in such a manner that for the macroscopic way of viewing things, it becomes sufficiently precise in position as well as in momentum. 

It is true also that this sharpness remains for a long time and that the quasi-points thus represented behave just like the mass-points of classical mechanics. However, the theory shows also that, after a sufficiently long time, the point-like character of the Psi-function is completely lost to the center of gravity-co-ordinates, so that one can no longer speak of any quasi-localisation of the centers of gravity. 

The picture then becomes, for example in the case of a single macro-mass-point, quite similar to that involved in a single free electron.

If now, in accordance with the orthodox position, I view the Psi-function as the complete description of a real matter of fact for the individual case, I cannot but consider the essentially unlimited lack of sharpness of the position of the (macroscopic) body as real. 

On the other hand, however, we know that, by illuminating the body by means of a lantern at rest against the system of co-ordinates, we get a (macroscopically judged) sharp determination of position. In order to comprehend this I must assume that that sharply defined position is determined not merely by the real situation of the observed body, but also by the act of illumination. 

This is again a paradox (similar to the mark on the paper strip in the above mentioned example). The spook disappears only if one relinquishes the orthodox standpoint, according to which the Psi-function is accepted as a complete description of the single system.

It may appear as if all such considerations were just superfluous learned hairsplitting, which have nothing to do with physics proper. However, it depends precisely upon such considerations in which direction one believes one must look for the future conceptual basis of physics.

I close these expositions, which have grown rather lengthy, concerning the interpretation of quantum theory with the reproduction of a brief conversation which I had with an important theoretical physicist. He=  “I am inclined to believe in telepathy.” I=  “This has probably more to do with physics than with psychology.” He=  “Yes.”

The essays by Lenzen and Northrop both aim to treat my occasional utterances of epistemological content systematically. 

From those utterances Lenzen constructs a synoptic total picture, in which what is missing in the utterances is carefully and with delicacy of feeling supplied. 

Everything said therein appears to me convincing and correct. 

Northrop uses these utterances as point of departure for a comparative critique of the major epistemological systems. I see in this critique a masterpiece of unbiased thinking and concise discussion, which nowhere permits itself to be diverted from the essential.

The reciprocal relationship of epistemology and science is of noteworthy kind. They are dependent upon each other. 

Epistemology without contact with science becomes an empty scheme. Science without epistemology is — insofar as it is thinkable at all — primitive and muddled. However, no sooner has the epistemologist, who is seeking a clear system, fought his way through to such a system, than he is inclined to interpret the thought-content of science in the sense of his system and to reject whatever does not fit into his system. 

The scientist, however, cannot afford to carry his striving for epistemological systematic that far. He accepts gratefully the epistemological conceptual analysis. But the external conditions set by the facts of experience, do not permit him to restrict himself too much in the construction of his conceptual world by the adherence to an epistemological system. 

To the systematic epistemologist, the scientist would appear as a kind of unscrupulous opportunist. 

The scientist would appear as= 
- a realist insofar as he seeks to describe a world independent of perception
- an idealist insofar as he looks upon theories as the free inventions of the human spirit not logically derivable from what is empirically given
- a positivist insofar as he considers his theories justified only to the extent to which they furnish a logical representation of relations among sensory experiences 
- a Platonist or Pythagorean insofar as he considers the viewpoint of logical simplicity as an indispensable and effective tool of his research

All of this are in Lenzen’s and Northrop’s essays.

E. A. Milne, G. Lemaitre, and L. Infeld mentions the cosmological problem.

Milne’s ingenious reflections have a theoretical basis that is too narrow. I believe it is impossible to get reliable theoretial results in the field of cosmology without general relativity.
