THE science of Palmistry is founded on the shape of the hand. 

The 7 mounts lie at the base of the fingers and along the sides of the hand. The proper estimation of the combination of these mounts can let us accurately delineate the character of person. 

There are other separated elements which enter into and add to a proper understanding of the science, viz.=  
- how the hand is naturally carried and held when walking
- texture of the skin
- consistency of the hand
- color of the hand, the nails, hair on the hands
- the hands divided into three sections called the three worlds
- the shape of the fingers and their individual phalanges
- the shape of the finger-tips, knotty fingers, smooth fingers, long fingers, short fingers, and the thumb. 

A thorough knowledge of them all is absolutely necessary.

Chapters on the above-enumerated subjects comprise the first half of the science of Chirosophy, and collectively form the science of Chirognomy.
- Nowadays, this branch is limited to merely studying the subject's character. But it has wider scope and can be made much more useful. 

The universe began with a perfectly well-defined plan which includes the human species

The currently accepted types of Chirognomy show many human qualities from the lines of the hand. But the previous limits of scientific hand-reading quickly led to practitioners guessing on that plan of creation. 

No scientific study can depend on guesswork. This is why Palmistry has of its own weight fallen to the ground. The plan of creation is exceedingly simple, easily understood, and can be verified in every person you meet.

You do not have to take anything for granted, nor believe in anything you cannot see or touch or hold in your hand, consequently in this very practical and realistic age, the most advanced materialist can embrace the new science of Palmistry without offending in any way his sense of propriety. 

The plan of creation can be learned from the Mounts in the hand as shown in illustration "A."

The Mounts' names are astrological. They are just traditional. <!--   sense, but because they have been so long in use that the mention of each name instinctively brings to mind certain attributes.  -->

I use these names because they are easy to remember, though any other names would do. They have no reference to the planets. <!-- are not used because it is considered that planetary influences are necessary, or play any part, in our science. -->


## The Seven Types of People

The ancient theory says that the human race was constructed by its Creator under a definite plan. 
<!-- There was no hit-or-miss in shaping and putting together the inhabitants of this globe. The fact that there are so many
 -->
The numerous combinations in this plan of creation has, however, confused many who do not know the <!-- .  been a source of confusion to those who have not fully understood the matter, but everything in this plan has been worked out by the Creator under the operation of --> specific laws and rules. When these laws are understood, the whole plan reveals itself.

The 7 distinct types of people were first created, each with strong qualities, aptitudes, virtues, and faults, as well as peculiarities of health and character.

> *Superphysics note=  The seven types come from the seven chakras. Those chakras are affected by the light from stars and planets (reflected). This is why the original Hindu palmistry theory uses astrological names. It will be very complicated to connect the stars with human behavior and so we agree with Benham that the mounts can be disconnected from astrology. Instead, the mounds represent the natural chakra sizes which differ in each human. These then accept starlight in a regular way as to create predicatble patterns of behavior   


Having seven types was <!-- The reason for the adoption of this plan was that a combination of the qualities represented in these seven types was --> absolutely necessary to the harmonious operation of the universe. If all humanity was of one type, progress would be stopped, and diversity of talent and thought, with its various methods of expression and operation, would not exist.

**Removing the existence any one of these types would be like removing one wheel in a watch - the movement would stop.** 

Each type was thus created for a specific sphere in life. It represents some element indispensable to the harmonious operation of the world as a whole*.


> *Superphysics note=  This is consistent with the division of labour idea of Adam Smith and is the heart of the Second law of value of Pantrynomics


<!-- The fact that there are well-defined specimens of all these types on the streets of our cities to-day, that they can be easily recognized, and that  -->

These can be easily identified in everyone. 85% of these typical people are at their best in the same occupations. All have the same faults, the same virtues, like the same kind of surroundings, live, think, and act after the same plan in everything they do. This proves that the original method in creating humanity has not been changed.<!-- , but that the laws of creation are in operation to-day just as they were in the beginning.  -->

Knowing these 7 types helps us distinguish them from each other as we meet them. This will help us at once know= 
- their characteristics
- what their type has done through ages past
- what the outcome of their life is likely to be, judged by those of the same type who have gone before

We can thus know the person's:
- past -- we know what ancestors of the same type have always done
- present -- we know what the typical people always do 
- the possible future -- we know what the outcome generally is

<!-- If we can feel sure that there are, as I say, seven types of people, each of which has distinctly separate qualities, and if we can know what these qualities are, it must be a fact that, when we learn to  -->

The correct reading of the past, present, and possible future is based absolutely upon your recognition of the Mount type to which your client belongs, after which recognition you can apply to him what you know is common to the type which he represents. 

For example, the Jupiterian is always ambitious and a leader of men. We apply this to= 
- his health
- his food
- his home life
- his religion
- his business
- his natural proficiency for certain employments
- his vices
- his passions
- his manner of living
- his thoughts
- his liability to marry or remain single, the kind of person he always marries, and
- everything else about him. 

This type has always the same ideas on all of these matters. 

Every other type has its own peculiarities. Thus, if your client is a pure specimen, you know he has them all, as have his predecessors of the same type. 

One type marries young, another marries people older than themselves, another avoids marriage entirely. If you have recognized the type to which your client belongs, you can tell him what he will be likely to do in these matters. Some types are long-lived, some die earlier, and, recognizing your type, you can handle this most delicate subject properly.

You should not approach the length of life unless you are absolutely proficient, careful, and tactful. These Mount type system will enable you to handle this most delicate question without harming your subject. 

**In fact, all that there is to destiny or fate is this matter of the seven types. **


Humanity is cast in certain moulds. Unless the course of a type is changed it acts, thinks, lives, and dies in a certain way; the ancestors of this type have so lived, acted, and died, and it will do the same. 

If everyone were pure specimens of these types, then we might be fatalists. But the deeper you go into Palmistry the less will you accept an absolutely fatalistic doctrine. 

In every case, one type or the other will be predominant. Its qualities will be the strong controlling element in the life of your client. In his course through the world the qualities of his type will largely guide and shape his destiny. But there is nearly always present an alloy of some other type, something that may soften the severe lines of his natural mould.

If he strongly wishes to change his course in life, is fully conscious of what he wants to accomplish and has determination enough, he may modify the qualities of his type to a large degree. 

A knowledge of his shortcomings, coupled with desire and determination, will enable him largely to overcome them. Since they all emanate from the brain, these faults, these desires, these changes, will all be written on the hands.

People do not change their typical qualities until they have a strong desire to change, and are armed with a firm resolution to do it. Thus it will seem that there is no greater truth than that we are indeed free agents, planned for a prearranged destiny, but always able to change it if we determinedly desire to do so. There is, then, no such thing as absolute fatalism, even though we have so strong an indication in that direction from the seven types. The statement, "The Lord helps him who helps himself' applies.

Thus, instead of rebelling at what might seem a cruel predestination on the part of our Creator in adopting the plan of the seven types, we can see that there is nothing unkind in the operation of this plan. You see the Esquimaux living always in the same way. One generation succeeds the other, lives the same way, eats the same food, reaches the same age, and dies. There is nothing cruel in that; you have never thought that fate was unkind to the Esquimaux. 

He would laugh at you if you told him so. He enjoys life in his way, just as well as you do in yours. Each of our seven types reasons in the same fashion. They are best pleased with their way of living, thinking, and acting, they prefer it to your way. They think you odd that you do not see it as they do. You think it strange that they can be satisfied at all with their ways. Thus the world moves on, seemingly a heterogeneous mass, yet in reality possible of subdivision into seven well-classified types of people.

These types look alike. If you know each type well, then you will know= 
- what they look like
- how they reason, live, think, work, play, treat their fellows, or marry, 
- their natural occupations and peculiarities

This will let you dissect him with ease, knowing him better than he knows himself.

- The Mount of Jupiter identifies the Jupiterian type
- The Mount of Saturn identifies the Saturnian
- The Mount of Apollo identifies the Apollonian
- The Mount of Mercury identifies the Mercurian
- The two Mounts of Mars identifies the Martian
  - One of whom is filled with aggression, the other full of resistance
- The Mount of Moon identifies the Lunarian
- The Mount of Venus identifies the Venusian
- The Plain of Mars is a part of the Martian type

Why do the Mounts identify these types? 

<!-- To this question the answer must be given, that at this time we have not fully solved the mystery, but there are some facts leading in that direction which will doubtless in time give us a full explanation of the matter; for we know that  -->

The human hand is the servant of the brain which executes all of the work we do. It only operates in response to the commands of the brain. Sever the connection between hand and brain by cutting the complex system of nerve telegraph uniting the two (as in paralysis), and the hand becomes like a lump of putty, dead and useless.

The hand is the most wonderful instrument ever created. It cannot perform one act by itself, for there is no brain or intelligence located in the hand to direct it. It follows the commands of the brain.

<!-- , the seat of mind and intelligence, which is located a considerable distance from the hand itself. This shows that  -->

The hand is entirely dependent on the brain for its intelligence. As the servant, it reflects the kind of brain behind it.

<!-- by the manner and intelligence with which it performs its duties. It is a well-accepted fact that the centre of the brain, which is in connection with the hand, has been located, and  -->

The dissections of the brain show that the different formations of this brain centre comes with differently shaped hands.  <!-- This proves that the hand physically shows what kind of a brain is directing it. If the brain centre which controls the hand is of one shape, the Mount of Jupiter will be largest, and we shall have  --> Thus, a Jupiterian brain centre creates Jupiterian thoughts, ways and peculiarities. This leads to a Jupiterian subject with a Jupiter Mount.

<!-- If this brain centre changes its form the subject develops peculiarities of character, aptitude, and disease, and we shall find other Mounts most developed, for the hand reflects all the changes of the brain, and the subject will belong to the type as shown by the best-marked Mount in the hand. 

This is unquestionably the idea from which future scientific research will gain a full explanation of the Mounts. In 
 -->

The Chapter, "Mounts and Fingers =  How to Judge Them" gives minute directions for classifying your subject, know everything about him, and solve the secret of his creation. This is the inner secret of Palmistry.

<!-- , and there is nothing about him which you cannot know. , which professionals and amateurs, to whom I have taught it, declare has made them able to attain a proficiency they never hoped for nor believed possible. -->

The good types are the= 
- Jupiterian
- Apollonian
- Venusian

These have good health, happy dispositions, and do not easily become evil. 

The Saturnian and Mercurian easily cross the boundary and produce bad people. 

They are both bilious and become warped in their views and manner of life. 

The Martian easily becomes an ardent, intense type, not necessarily bad, but often violent. The Lunar subject is imaginative, cold, and selfish, easily producing a restless, disagreeable person. Thus you have three good types, two that may be bad, one violent, and one which may be disagreeable.

It will be apparent to those who have studied other authorities on Palmistry, that this work, with the Mounts for a basis, opens a rich field for investigation. Many realize how superficial their work has been, and have longed to know why they could go only so far and no farther. Without wishing to be captious, I must say that it is because, so far as I have been able to ascertain, no other work begins upon the proper foundation. 

I have added to palmistry the other elements:
- the elementary hand (dulness)
- the square hand (regularity)
- the spatulate hand (activity and originality)
- the philosophic hand (analysis)
- the conic hand (artistic sense)
- the psychic hand (ideality)
- the mixed hand (versatility) 

These are accepted types of all other modern works. 

These formations show only a certain traits of the subject. They do not reveal him in his entirety. They will not tell you of his health, how he marries, loves, hates, eats, lives, dies, whether he is good, bad, cross, or cheerful. They do not thus open the hidden recesses of his heart, as they are revealed by the Mount types, nor can you make that subtle distinction between disease and character except through the Mount types.

<!-- The works of other recent authors start from certain qualities of the subject (regularity, activity, etc.); this work starts from the man himself, created to fill a particular place, and endowed with all the qualities necessary to enable him to do it. Is it any wonder that greater revelations should come from such a beginning? -->

The success of hand-reading is a matter of combination. The type of a subject must be combined with his energy, brain power, good intentions, vices, health condition, and many other important factors, before a balance can be struck. Herein lies the difficulty in preparing a treatise on hand-reading. 

If the types are treated first, the beginner has no knowledge of the important underlying forces which must be combined with them. If the underlying forces are first discussed, the student is not familiar with the types. 

<!-- In the present work the leading attributes of the types are laid down in this chapter and shown in illustration "A." With this illustration and these attributes in mind, a sufficient knowledge of the types to begin with is obtained, and we pass to a thorough consideration of the underlying forces. When these have been fully mastered, we will take up a thorough discussion of the types, and will then have in our possession all the knowledge to combine with them. Thus the final chapters on the Mount types unfold the entire panorama, the difficulties in arranging the sequence of treatment of the various matters is reduced to a minimum, and put in the best form for the student's use. -->
