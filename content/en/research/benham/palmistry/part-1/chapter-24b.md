Part 3 

From the flabby, spongy character of his hand and muscular development, he is lazy in the extreme, preferring to live in cloudland rather than to dwell in an abode upon earth. 

He is constantly a prey to his imaginings, thinks he is ill, and has divers ailments, is fickle, restless, and changeable. It is hard for him to settle down to humdrum life, for he is always yearning for things beyond his reach. Therefore he is never satisfied long in one place, but desires a constant change of location and scene.

This restless disposition leads him to spend his last dollar for travel, and often the Lunarian becomes a great traveller. The more lines there are on the Mount the more restless he becomes and the greater is his desire to go from place to place. So while the lines on the Mount of the Moon do not per se especially indicate journeys, they do strengthen the Lunar qualities of the subject, and this Lunar restlessness makes him a traveller if he has money to gratify this desire. If the hand is firm and the wealth equal to it, you may be sure that a subject with these lines will gratify his love of travel by taking long voyages. If the circumstances do not permit the subject to gratify his love for change you will find that these lines produce in him a yearning for travel. 

The Lunarian, by his physical construction, has white color and white coldness of temperament. To him "self" is a great word. He is lazy physically and lazy mentally. He loves to dream dreams, and work, which means either mental or physical exertion, is extremely distasteful to him. He is dreamy in look, his eyes have an uncanny expression, and their light blue or gray color speaks of coldness and dreaminess. Thus he becomes mystical, often melancholy, and grows superstitious. 

He believes in signs and omens, and has wonderful visions and hallucinations which grow to be real to him and influence him greatly. He is slow in his movements, phlegmatic in disposition, and extremely sensitive. He imagines slights when none are intended, and shrinks into himself and away from company. He does not love nor seek society. He realizes that he is different from other people, so retires to the woods or secluded places where he can enjoy himself by himself. He loves nature, birds, flowers, and all things which elevate the senses and excite the imagination, and to such surroundings he goes when out of touch with the world and its inhabitants. 

He is fond of poetry, but it is the epic kind or verses which bring to mind a chain of new material to dream about. He loves music, but of the deep classic kind, not the gay, sparkling melody that attracts the Venusian. He is a composer, and in seclusion and retirement produces profound classics. The Lunarian is very fond of water. He loves the murmur of the waves and the roar and thunder of the tempest. As far as he is able he lives near water, and is on it as much as possible. The Lunarian makes a good sailor. He is never generous; to him selfishness is innate. He is a big eater, though not sensual nor amorous. 

In his case the sexual appetites are excited by imagination, and not by physical heat. The Lunarian is lacking in self-confidence, and feels his unfitness for the active pursuits of life. He also lacks energy and perseverance, consequently is unsuccessful in the business world. If he is of a common type he has a hard time to get along. If of a high type he becomes a good writer of romance or fiction, and even of history. This type will be much assisted if he has a long finger of Mercury with the first phalanx long. 

With this latter combination, conic tips will add to the imaginative tendencies of his writings; they will become more practical if the tips are square, and active and original if spatulate. Thus we see in the Lunarian a peculiar subject, in whom imagination and fancy are always the dominating motives. It is a blessing that the pure type is not more common, but it is necessary to have some of the imagination common to it. If all the people in the world were pure Lunarians it would not be long before there would not be insane asylums enough to hold them. But the possession of a healthy imagination is the farthest possible step from insanity, and the development of the Mount must be very bad and very strong before you begin to think of attributing such an outcome to your subject. Imagination must mean a good quality until it is spoiled by being found in excess.

The Lunarian, while not as strongly impelled toward matrimony as some of the other types, still does not avoid it entirely. He is cold by nature and incapable of strong affection. He has not great physical strength, so the fires of passion do not inflame him. He is as fickle and capricious here as everywhere else, and makes strange alliances. Sometimes he marries one much older than himself, sometimes one a great deal younger - you cannot tell much about what he will do except that he will make a peculiar match. 

These subjects have not the faculty of being constant, and as they are naturally fickle, restless, and selfish they make poor husbands or wives; this is pronounced with conic or pointed tips, less a fact with square or spatulate. No type appears in greater abundance among those having marital unhappiness than the Lunarian. The health difficulties of the type are many, for he has poor circulation, thin blood, white color, and spongy muscles, and therefore readily falls a prey to disease. 

Note in the description of the type that he has a paunchy abdomen, which in all pure specimens is largely distended. This shows that the same flabby condition is present in the intestines as with the muscles, and this condition, which may properly be called a weakening of these tissues, makes them a fertile place for bacilli to propagate, and we find the Lunarian a victim of peritonitis, inflammation of the bowels, appendicitis, and all other inflammations that are liable to attack the intestinal tract. 

In epidemics of Asiatic cholera, Lunarians are the first victims, as the bacilli which produce cholera propagate readily under such conditions as they present. 

<!-- Part 4  -->

This liability to intestinal disorder is shown on the upper third of the Mount by cross-bars, grilles, badly formed stars, dots, islands, crosses, or similar defective markings. When such are seen on this part of the Mount, bowel delicacy exists, and the Life line should be at once examined to determine how serious it is. If the Life line is broken, crossed, islanded, has a star on it, forks, or any of the innumerable defects peculiar to it, feel safe in saying that the subject has bowel difficulties of a serious nature. The Lunarian is also predisposed to gout and rheumatism. These are shown by the defects, such as crosses, grilles, etc., mentioned above, appearing on the middle third of the Mount. Other indications often confirm this; for instance, you will sometimes see a line running from the Mount of Saturn to the line of Life, either cutting it or stopping on it. 

This line has in addition frequently an island (124). I follow the practice with this indication of always looking for health defects of Saturn, one of which is rheumatism. I have many times seen a line running from the middle portion of the Mount of the Moon, another seat of rheumatism, and joining the line from Saturn either where it cuts the line of Life or somewhere in its course (124). 

This has shown invariably that the subject is either at the time a victim to severe rheumatism, has had it, or will have it, for when this double marking is seen, the rheumatic tendency is hereditary. The lower third of the Mount with defective markings found will indicate kidney and bladder trouble in men, and on a woman's hand, in addition, very pronounced female weakness (see Chittenden Hotel suicide). 

If you find the defective markings on this portion of the Mount, and the hand and nails very white, swollen and flabby in consistency, it will indicate kidney and bladder difficulty as well as tendency to dropsy. This dropsy will attack the feet and legs of this type, which are already swollen in appearance. I have noted also that kidney trouble is most often shown by cross-bars on the Mount. Often a line from such a bad marking on the Mount will be found running to the Life line, which will be forked or defective in some way, and this will show that these diseases threaten the life of the subject. Female trouble is also shown by this lower third of the Mount when defectively marked. When female weakness is present, there is often a star on the line of Mercury, usually near the line of Head or at a point where the Mercury line crosses the line of Head (125). 

When this star is seen, it is an unmistakable indication of serious female weakness. This I have verified hundreds of times. Remembering that these organs make possible the reproduction of the species, and that their diseased condition makes maternity either impossible or hazardous, the importance of this indication is very great, for it may tell why women seemingly healthy never have had children. It is also valuable as a pre-marriage indication, tending to show whether a union is likely to be fruitful. This is the place on the hand you must examine if consulted as to why no children have blessed a woman a question that is often eagerly asked. You can thus readily detect proof of diseased conditions of the reproductive organs, and the subject cannot have children while they are in such a state. Subjects so afflicted are frequently unaware of trouble of this character, consequently do not consult a physician and get the relief which is possible to them. This is one instance where a good practice of Palmistic knowledge can transform a barren, joyless home into one of fruition and happiness. These health indications shown by the three sections of the Mount of the Moon are so often encountered and so reliable that I commend them to most careful attention. 

It does not follow that when these markings and health defects are seen the subject is a Lunarian, but it does show that he has a health defect peculiar to this type. Which one it is will be indicated by whatever portion of the Mount shows the defective markings =  bowel trouble, upper third; gout and rheumatism, middle third; kidney, bladder, and female trouble, lower third.

The bad Lunarian <!-- is found, as are all the other types, with his bad side developed.  -->:
- is shorter in stature
- has hair stiff and brittle
- has skin dead white and spotted
- has eyes watery and gray
- has the pores of the skin exuding disagreeable perspiration. 
- is talkative
- is apt to be untruthful
- often allows the imagination to run rampant
- thus he deceives not only others but himself as well. 
- is mean and selfish, cowardly
- has no physical passion
- constantly seeks amorous pleasures in order to gratify their imagination. 

Examples are nymphomaniacs. They are:
- deceitful
- hypocritical
- tend to slander everyone who incurs their displeasure
- insolent
- unchaste
- most disagreeable creatures
- shunned and abhorred by mankind. 


## Insanity 

Excessive luna development and consequent liability produces insanity. 

If it is very large, both bulging at the percussion and thick in the palm, having strong vertical lines, or with a well-marked star, it is a Mount liable to lead to the excess of imagination, and, consequently, insanity. 

This may be a mild species of hallucination if the hand is fine and the indications not pronounced, or it may be dangerous and brutal mania with a coarse brutal type of Lunarian. Excess of the Mount will make excess of the imagination, which, per se, means an unbalanced condition of mind; so with every excessive Mount look for this unhinging of the mental faculties commonly called insanity, whose presence is indicated in several ways, the excessive Mount of the Moon being one of them.

In seeking the cause which has produced insanity in any subject, that arising from the excess of the Mount of the Moon shows it has not been shock or disease, but that it is excessive imagination inherent in the subject. This form of mania is difficult to treat, for the nature of the subject, which is inherently crazy, cannot be changed. 


## Women

Female troubles create a disturbance of the mind. 

They grow gloomy and despondent when their trouble is intense, and especially during their monthly periods. 

<!-- Part 5  -->

During some such periods, the mind of an otherwise strong and healthy subject becomes temporarily clouded, and she imagines all sorts of things, frequently that her husband is growing less affectionate, and kindred ideas. 

During all such periods these subjects should have the greatest care and kindness, and nothing should ever be allowed which will annoy them. I have seen the hands of a number of suicides with this lower third of the Mount of the Moon showing female weakness, and who were undoubtedly temporarily unbalanced when they committed the act (see Chittenden Hotel suicide). In the insane asylums are many cases from this cause, all showing this marking on the hand. It is natural that the Lunarian type will be much influenced by various qualities indicated by the several parts of the hand. Texture of the skin will bring to bear refiniug or coarsening influences. 

If the texture is soft and fine, it will undoubtedly be found with flabby consistency, consequently while the imaginings will be on a high plane of refinement these subjects will be lazy and accomplish little. Their ideals will be high, tastes refined, the dreams that come to them will be of beautiful and refined things. Coarseness will be abhorrent and aestheti-cism extreme. Oscar Wilde is an example of this class. The medium texture is best with a well-developed Lunar Mount, for it will speak of more energy and more practical ideas. This is the subject who will not be bound down by materialism, but who has a reasonable play of the mind. 

Coarse texture will mean an accompaniment of the hard consistency. This subject will have an inelastic mind, coarse and unrefined ideas, low ideals, with superstition extremely marked, or intense mysticism, and often the bad development of the type is accompanied by this coarse texture of skin. The less the intelligence and the coarser the nature, the more superstitious is a subject. Consistency will tell how much the natural Lunar laziness is increased or how much energy from some of the other types has been infused. Flabby consistency is expected in a pure type, and accentuates all the qualities of the type - idealism, fancy, dreaminess, and laziness. 

Such subjects are idle dreamers, and the world seldom knows that they have lived. Elastic consistency shows that intelligent energy will put to some use the ideas of the mind, and the subject will be clever, not bound down by rule, versatile, ingenious, a good talker, and will have original ideas, for healthy imagination produces these things.

In addition, he will not sit idly and make nothing of his ideas, but will work, for he has energy. If a business man, the subject will devise new schemes to push his business. If a writer, he will be happy in bis efforts, for he will have both the mind to produce and energy to do the work. Some of the best authors belong to this class. As a musician and composer he will have the natural ability for his work and the energy to do it. Hard consistency is abnormal. It will give great activity and will make the subject restless, superstitious, selfish, and mystical. 


These people are not contented with their lot in life, but are growlers and trouble breeders. Their imagination is active but not directed toward elevated matters, and, being constantly dissatisfied themselves, they create dissatisfaction among others. The hard-handed Lunarian has distorted views on religion and all matters of life. He is often uneducated, though he assumes to talk like a professor, but reaches after an idea which he never succeeds in expressing. 

He is superstitious, and often seeks all of the lower manifestations of Spiritism which appeal to his love of the supernatural. These subjects are the greatest travellers, always discontented, out of tune with the world, and seeking change or excitement. Flexibility shows the elastic mind, and consequently adds to the Lunarian imagination. If marked, the subject will be flighty, will be extreme in views and moods, one moment exalted, the next depressed. These people are brilliant, for with the flexible mind added to imagination they could not be otherwise, but they hate effort and do not make much of their talent. 

They are good conversationalists, and versatile mentally. Normal flexibility will reduce the danger of extremes. The mind will not so readily become a prey to imagination, but will be held in check and directed into practical channels. There will be no lessening of the ability to form mental pictures, but there will be less tendency to be dominated by them. 

Thus medium flexibility is best for a Lunarian to possess. The stiff hand will indicate lack of intelligence in the subject. He will have the lower qualities of the type, will be miserly, will lack sympathy, and his imagination will satisfy itself in hunting mysterious manifestations rather than in developing any product of a highly original mind. He will shudder when the door creaks, will be terrified when a dog howls, and being cold, selfish, and fanciful, is a hard subject with whom to deal. The color of the hands claims attention with this type. White is the color typical of the strong Lunarian. It will aid greatly in judging the degree of type. 


If very pronounced, the coldness of the type will be strongly marked, and health defects must be carefully studied. If the hand is pink, it will show that the type is warmed up, and the heart is stronger, the blood richer and is reaching the skin in good supply. With this condition there will be less mysticism, less idealism, more practical ideas, more warmth of nature, less selfishness, and less restlessness. The subject will be even tempered, less fickle, and less liable to health defects of the type. 

Red color will show a great increase of these improvements. Ardor and warmth will be marked, and often, when you cannot understand why a Lunar subject shows so little coldness, it will be found that the hand, lines, and nails are quite red. This warms him up in every way, and makes health troubles of the lower third less likely, but renders him more liable to the bowel inflammations of the upper third. It also makes him amorous and easily excited by anything that is suggestive or appeals to his imagination. Yellow color will add a disagreeable indication, for it will make him cross and ugly.
