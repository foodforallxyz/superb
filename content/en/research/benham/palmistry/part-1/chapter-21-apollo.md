The Apollonian is identified by the Mount and finger of Apollo.
- This is a good type. 

The Apollonian sometimes becomes mercenary and shoddy. 
- But he does not often become bad or criminal.
- Saturn and Mercury, the bilious types, become bad and vicious. 

Apollonians do not often descend to criminality. 
- When they do, it is the result of sudden emotions or circumstances, and not as a result of inherent badness. 

The following strenthen the Mount of Apollo as single signs, or in combination:
- star
- triangle
- circle
- single vertical line
- square
- trident

The cross-bar, grille, cross, island, or dot, show defects of the Mount, either of health or character. Nails, color, etc., will determine which (102). 

The normal Apollonian is healthy and vigorous. Consequently, he is happy, genial, and attractive. 

He is a spontaneous type, and versatility, brilliancy, love of the beautiful and artistic in everything, are his attributes. Standing alongside the Saturnian, he is the direct opposite of that gloomy fellow. 

The dark side of life is in the background with him and, as the Saturnian was needed as a check to over-enthusiasm, so the Apollonian is needed in order that darkness and gloom may not dominate. 

Play and diversion must follow work if we are to keep ourselves healthy and vigorous, and someone must provide these recreative things, these rests from seriousness. We must have comedians, for laughter is atonic to the tired brain. The Jupiterian is engrossed in his schemes for aggrandizement; 

The Saturnian is absorbed in wisdom, sobriety, or gloom; who then shall provide the bright things which shall make life worth living? That task is the Apollonian's. This type has been completely misunderstood. It has always stood for art and brilliancy. and the temptation has been to ascribe to every hand which has a good Mount of Apollo great artistic talent, frequently far in excess of that really possessed by the subject. 

All Apollonians are not artists or actors, and never can be. 

But all Apollonians love beauty in dress, home, business surroundings, and every walk in life in which they are found. They enjoy life by the force of their spontaneous natures, and cause those around them to enjoy it. All things beautiful and artistic appeal to them. It by no means follows that they will ever be producers or creators of art, but it is certain they always love it. Between a person with creative power and a mere lover of the beautiful there is a wide difference, never lose sight of this fact in the Apollonian type. Do not ascribe great artistic talent to one who is merely fond of beauty in dress and surroundings. To be sure, the Apollonian is a lover of art, but unless he has a finely developed Mount, apex in the centre, finger long, first phalanx long, and a fine, deep-cut Line of Apollo (103), often with stars 011 it, do not ascribe creative artistic power to him. With the above strong markings he will have creative power and will not be merely a lover of the beautiful (104).

The Apollonian has another side. He is highly successful in business, and he carries his love of beauty here as everywhere else. He is richly endowed with graces which draw people to him, and with his natural brilliancy and versatility he adapts himself to the conditions of the times, the demands of the public, chooses his goods with a tasteful eye, and makes money thereby. 

This subject is found strongly marked with a high Mount, apex in the centre, but not necessarily cut with deep lines; if there are any such, you will find several vertical ones on the Mount, showing diversity of talent, but not the creative power of the artist. Generally you find a secondary, Mercurian development to accentuate the business shrewdness. With the Apollonian it is necessary, above all, to distinguish these two classes, - those capable of creative power in art, and those who are mere lovers of the beautiful and tasteful things of life.

The Apollonian is a handsome and a manly type. He is of medium height, between the Jupiterian and Saturnian, is not fleshy like the Jupiterian nor lean and lanky like the Saturnian, but is shapely, muscular, and athletic. The lines of the body run in graceful curves, and he is light and supple. His complexion is clear, his skin white, fine and firm in texture, and cheeks rosy. This pinkness of color gives the clue to a healthy condition and consequent attractiveness. 

The hair is thick, wavy, and black or auburn in color, fine and silky in quality, and when he has a beard it partakes of the same fineness and abundance, growing over the chin, lip, and high on the cheeks. His forehead is broad and full, but not high, the eyes are large, almond-shaped, brown or blue in color, with long lashes curling up at the ends. 

The eyes have a frank, honest expression, which changes to sweetness and sympathy when the emotions are in play, and they sparkle with the brilliancy and life of the brain behind them. His cheeks are firm and rounded, showing no hollows. The nose is straight and finely shaped, the nostrils beautifully proportioned, and dilating sensitively under the play of emotions; as is the case with all highly strung organizations. 

The mouth is graceful in outline, the lips curved and set evenly, neither thin nor large and thick. The teeth are finely shaped, strong, even, and white, firmly set in healthy red gums. The chin is shapely and rounded, neither retreating nor protruding, showing evenly balanced firmness. The ears are of medium size, well formed, and pink, setting close to the head. The neck is long, muscular, and well shaped, but showing neither cord-like muscles, nor a prominent "Adam's apple." This shapely neck connects the well-shaped head with strong shoulders, which are muscular and graceful. The chest is full and capacious, expands well under the inspiration, which fact undoubtedly contributes much to purifying the blood, pink color with healthy conditions following. The voice is musical, but not full or resonant. The lower limbs are graceful, muscular, finely proportioned, and are never fat. The feet are of medium size, the insteps arching and high, which gives spring and elasticity to the walk. 

This is a particularly distinguishing feature of the Apollonian. In this type is a picture of healthy conditions, beautiful proportions, grace and symmetry of body, and to these must be linked a mind full of similar charms and attributes. The Mount Of Apollo. Part 2 From every point of view the Apollonian is brilliant, full of the love of beauty, art, color, and form. 

The Mount, from its brilliancy, has also been called the Mount of the Sun, and the Line of Apollo, when strongly marked in the hand, has been called the Line of the Sun, or of Brilliancy, and to it has been ascribed a fortunate career, with wealth and fame as the reward. As this line shows the strength of development of the Apollonian qualities in a subject, making the Mount stronger, thus the type also, it is not unreasonable that wealth and fame should be secured by so brilliant a subject as is the Apollonian. The Apollonian is highly intuitive. He sees through things more quickly than other people and especially is this perceptive faculty strong in art and literature. He does not labor to learn, as does his companion, the Saturnian, neither is he as profound and deep. But the Apollonian, no matter how little he may really know, will make a brilliant show of it, and in any company, from the seeming depth of his knowledge and research, is a surprise. This arises from the wonderful versatility of his nature, and the quick way he has of grasping a small idea and making a great deal out of it. He is inventive as well as an imitator, and can put old things in new ways. 

 Thus he often gets credit for knowing a great deal more than he really does. He is always the centre of attraction in whatever company he may be found, and will adapt himself to circumstances and people. He can be thrown with scientists and will cope with them in whatever field of research they are working. He will, with equal facility and without thought or preparation, join a body of socialists, artists, anarchists, doctors, lawyers, or any profession or class, and will astonish those present with his seeming mastery of the particular subject. His adaptability and versatility are astonishing, and "brilliant" is the only word that fitly describes him. He fairly sparkles with intuition, and seems to learn without study. This makes him sought by all classes of people. He is the life of the drawing-room, the hero of the athletic field, the daring and successful plunger either in the stock market or at the gaming table. In any and all walks of life he is found, full of dash, brilliancy, versatility. For him the beautiful in nature, women, home decorations, and dress, have always a fascination. Anything that lacks beauty is repulsive. With this strong passion in him he is the artist always and in everything. He may not be the great painter, but if he have short nails, surely he is the critic. He adores art in every form, and owing to his versatility, he is always a dabbler in it. He loves fine clothes, luxurious home surroundings, and jewels. If he is the refined type with first phalanx the longest, he will have excellent taste in all these. If he belongs to the class who have the world of the third phalanx longest, he will be loud and shoddy in displaying his love of such matters. He is a good fellow. Health is good with him, so he feels kindly toward mankind, especially as he manages to cope with them so easily. He is a warm friend, but being somewhat changeable is not always constant. 

 Being brilliant, he makes enemies among those less so than himself, and these enemies often become bitter and envious rivals. His brain is clear, and in all matters of business, religion, art, or literature he sees things from a logical point of view. He has a great facility of expression, and while not always deep is easy to understand. To him success is natural, it comes by the very force of circumstance. Friends and the world like him and gladly do much to forward his interests, and he is thus pushed by his admirers into many advantageous enterprises. He attains high positions and is a great money-maker. He is never economical and does not rely on putting away a part of his earnings, but by brilliant and successful spurts forges ahead. His tastes are luxurious and his expenditures follow them, but he makes so much that the expenses seem little. He is always figuring in the thousands, and looks down upon the single dollars. The Apollonian is never afraid to air his views, or to speak his mind freely, and he loves to hear himself talk. He is religious in his instincts, and seemingly understands religion as he does every other subject and problem of the universe. He is not a fanatic, nor superstitious, nor is he a doubter; but he embraces religious faith with the eagerness characteristic of him. Among his other accomplishments, he is proficient in occult sciences, and does some wonderful things. He cannot explain how, but knows it is not from deep study. It is in reality his highly intuitive faculties that make him proficient here. 

 He is cheerful, happy, and bright, and though he is subject to bursts of quick temper which are fierce while they last, it is only a momentary flash, and he holds no resentment. He does not harbor grudges and has the ability to win over his worst enemy to at least a seeming friendship. He does not make lasting friends, but by his brilliancy temporarily attracts and enslaves. He himself is not a lasting friend, consequently he does not inspire true friendship in others. As much as he loves pleasure and gayety he is neither amorous nor sensual, - that is, in the high type. He loves a banquet as much for the after-dinner wit, the music, the decorations, the beauty of dress, as for the viands which grace the table. He loves women who are beautiful, finely or tastefully dressed, and passions of the baser sort do not inflame him. He does not fall a prey to dissipation as easily as might be thought, though he will not refuse pleasure in any form when it has the proper accompaniments. He is a great traveller and fond of seeing the world. He is honest, and acknowledges his faults, fully appreciates his own brilliancy and does not deny it. He does not need to steal for he can make money too easily. He honestly desires celebrity and gains it. If he relied more on effort and less on brilliancy, he would reach fame more frequently and in greater degree. If he could chain his talents, his brilliancy of mind, body, and endowment, down to a definite line of work, he would dominate the world. As it is, he moves among us a brilliant possibility, a magnificent specimen physically and mentally, a joy, a pleasure, a benefit, but too often, through his versatility, a "Jack-of-all-trades." In his marriage relations the Apollonian is often unhappy. The Mount Of Apollo. Part 3 He is predisposed to marry, does not, like the Saturnian, withdraw from and hate mankind, but his ideal is very high; he is brilliant himself and he wants a mate who can shine with him. Humanity is frail, and those most brilliant often choose much less-favored helpmates. When this is the case the Apollonian finds himself disappointed and his marriage a failure. With a large percentage of the type this is true and should be so treated in your readings. There is a bad type of Apollonian.

 In it you find the markings of Mount and finger strong enough to show you that the subject is of this type, but you find a thick third phalanx, short first, crooked finger with short nails, hard consistency, no flexibility, or with other indications showing a decrease of the mentality and fineness of the type. Then the subject will be undersized, with common features, none of the beauty of the best type. The hair will be stiff, crisp, and a dingy yellow. The complexion will be either red or sallow, the eyes sometimes crossed, and instead of a clean, tidy, artistic being, you have a common person not giving any indication of the brilliancy of the type. This specimen will be vain and boastful, and have a good opinion of himself and his ability. He is fond of show and display (the material world rules) and, with the extravagance of the type present without his brilliant way of money-making, he will be improvident and poor. 

 He craves notoriety, will tell how talented he is, seeks to be an actor, and greatly overestimates himself. When repulsed he becomes bitter and revengeful and thinks himself badly used. He imagines that his want of success comes from the fact that others are conspiring against him. He will stop at nothing to make himself conspicuous, and will commit any folly to produce this result. Altogether he is an unhappy, unsuccessful creature. Note, however, that he is seldom criminal. The two extremes of this type have many degrees of development between them, and the Apollonian type is often combined with other types that modify it. With the mental picture of the two extreme types, I do not believe there will be any trouble after practice in estimating the degree of Apollonian quality possessed by any subject. All Apollonians have health difficulties peculiar to them. The type is naturally a healthy one and to this fact may be attributed much of their success. They are entirely wanting in that most baneful influence, biliousness, so none of its irritating, depressing effect is present. 

 This shows on health, temper, and character, for the Apollonian, free from bile, is usually healthy, happy, and good, and even on his worst side not a criminal. He does not over-eat and his stomach is healthy, but his heart is often irregular in its movement. Heart trouble is the principal health defect of the type. When examining an Apollonian for health, look for blue nails, the heart-disease nail, look at the Heart-line for islands, dots, cross bars, cuts in the line, chains, stars, or anything that is a defect of the line, and then at the Life line for some sign of delicacy there. Look for a grille on the Mount, and if found with any of the above indications, it will tell you that it is a health defect of the type and not a check to his prosperity. Look for cross-bars cutting the Mount; these are worse than a grille. By this method you can locate heart trouble, the leading health difficulty of the type. The Apollonian is subject to weak eyes. If you find a health defect in your subject, see if a small dot or small island is found on the Head line under the Mount. This will locate the trouble in the eyes. He is also liable to sunstroke and should avoid danger from this source. Fevers are also likely but they are acute attacks, and, unless the Life line shows great disturbance and other indications are found, you will have trouble in locating them. This matter will be fully treated later as it does not properly belong here. It is essential to know the health defects of the type, as necessity to use them will frequently arise. Note carefully the apex of the Mount, see if it is directly in the centre or whether it leans to one or the other Mounts. If Apollo leans toward Saturn it will give off some of its brightness and gayety to the melancholy Mount. Thus Saturn will be less sombre, sad, and severe. If Saturn leans toward Apollo it will make Apollo more grave, serious, and less spontaneous. 

 If Apollo leans towards Mercury it will tinge that Mount with the love of beauty and the artistic sense and brilliancy of Apollo. If Mercury leans toward Apollo it will make Apollo partake of the business shrewdness and scientific qualities of Mercury. By understanding each Mount thoroughly and remembering that when one Mount leans toward another, it gives off some of its force to the Mount toward which it leans, you can reason out all displacements of the Mounts. This is a great advantage gained by thoroughly understanding the Mount types. Having now a thorough understanding of the Apollonian type, we will apply to him the qualities which underlie his character and find out what they will do for him. Texture of the skin will tell us whether the subject is refined or coarse. Here, as every where else, we do not find the type exclusively in any one station or grade in life. Common as well as refined people have Apollonian qualities. Texture will help to locate the grade. If fine, the mental world (first phalanx) is probably predominant, and the love of refined beauty and art the result. Coarse texture will make the tastes coarse, and with it we expect the lower world to rule, (third phalanx). 


 In this case a love of loud colors and display will be present. The medium texture will follow the middle world (second phalanx) and the business side will be strong. Consistency will show whether energy or laziness is to make or mar the success of the subject. The flabby hand will produce the hyper-refined idler, full of beautiful visions, with the most luxurious and fastidious tastes, but too lazy to do any work to gratify them. The Mount Of Apollo. Part 4 In this case someone else will be the support, as no more impractical subjects exist than the flabby-handed Apollouians. They are attractive, however, and have many friends for they do not have energy enough to make enemies. Soft hands are better, for these show the subject will put forth some effort. These subjects are as artistic and refined as the flabby hands, but will do something occasionally, and can cultivate energy if they wish to. The elastic consistency belongs to the Apollonian who makes money out of his brilliancy. If he is an artist he produces something marketable and has the faculty of finding a buyer. If he is an actor he finds a good salary in return for his talents. As a writer he gets pay for his efforts. He is successful in business for he brings intelligent energy to bear on these pursuits and turns his brilliancy to account. The hard hand belongs to a coarse Apollonian, who talks much and lacks the refinement belonging to the higher development of the type. Flexibility will show elasticity added to an already brilliant mind. If the flexibility is great and the Apollonian type strongly marked, it will show the most versatile, brilliant person imaginable. Too much so in fact, for he will fly to extremes and will constantly shoot over the heads of the inhabitants of earth. Every impression and emotion find quick expression with him, and he enjoys and suffers much, so delicately is he organized. This is the brilliant artist who works by fits and starts producing only a few things in a lifetime but each of them a gem. This subject is very extravagant. The medium flexibility will be best for the subject, for no additional mental elasticity is needed by a pure Apollonian. This will make a subject well balanced, even tempered, and self contained; one who will not easily fly off at a tangent, and in both the worlds of art and business, he will, by being more conservative, be more successful. The stiff hand will show that the stiff-brain qualities have taken away some of the versatility of the subject. 

 He will be less likely to scatter his energies, and more inclined to confine himself to a definite occupation. He will be less brilliant, as the typical Apollonian qualities are much reduced. Pink or red color we expect to find in the Apollonian for the healthy type must have one of the healthy colors. Pink will lend vivacity and cheer to the already happy subject, and is the color par excellence. Red will show strong, healthy blood supply, but it should not be too pronounced for heart trouble is a difficulty of the type. If found, look at nails and Heart line to see how much pressure the heart is sustaining. White color is not expected, for Apollonians are not cold, if present it will pull down the attractiveness and health of the subject, showing a weak heart, and this is dangerous, for it is the health defect of the type. Here again look well to nails and Heart line. With white color, there will be no such success as belongs to the natural type, and when found, it will tell of the probable spoiling of the best qualities of the subject. Yellow color is rare with the pure type of Apollonian. Saturnian or Mercurian types may be found to be secondary, in which case yellow color may be present, but it is not expected with the Apollonian type, and is a great defect when found. It will, to a large degree, spoil the subject and make his success harder to accomplish and much less certain. One source of beauty in this type is his freedom from excess of bile, but when he has this, he is no better than other types which have it. If yellow color is found, examine carefully to see if it is merely temporary, if not, give yellow color qualities to the subject in whatever degree of pronouncedness you find it. Blue color will be seen if heart difficulty is present. It will be seen in temporary blue blotches in the hand, or, if severe, in the coloring of the whole palm. The nails will also have the deep blue settled at their bases which will tell of serious heart trouble. This is augmented if the heart-disease nail is found. Be careful what you say to this subject, so as not to alarm him, for that would be dangerous. It is well to look carefully to the Heart line, and note whether an island or dot appears on it under the Mount of Apollo. If so, this case is very serious. The Life line should then be examined to judge to what extent the difficulty has undermined the constitution, or is likely to. The nails will tell by their size, whether the general health is strong or delicate. This will have much to do in estimating the subject. The color under the nail will show whether pink health, white coldness, yellow biliousness, red ardor, or blue heart trouble is present. The latter is most important with this type. Pink nails are what we expect; others are abnormal and when found give their quality to the subject. The texture of nail will show whether nervous trouble is present. This is sometimes produced by the manner in which the subject takes chances and rushes into speculation. 

 Through all the nervous formations it can be judged what degree of trouble is present. Bulbous nails add tubercular trouble, either of lungs or spine. Short, critical nails will give argumentative force to a person already fond of talking, and he will push his view with vigor. Heart-disease nails will show structural defect in the Apollonian's weak spot. A finely textured, pink-colored, smooth, open nail is what we expect to find, which will tell of brightness, spontaneity, and honesty. Hair on the hands tells of the vigor of the constitution. Blond hair is expected and must be distinguished from yellow or silver color; and to be the typical Apollonian blond must be of a brilliant golden hue. There is more fire and snap to this hair, which approaches black than when it is a dull, straw color. Black hair makes the subject quicker and more vivacious, adding to the sparkle of an already sparkling character. It also lends to the subject a dash of the fire belonging to black color, and makes him unusually sharp and keen. he Mount Of Apollo. Part 5 The more hair found on the hand the more vitality the subject has. The hand as a whole, will tell in which world the subject moves. If the fingers predominate in length over the palm, then mind will rule, and either in literature, art, poetry, drawing, architecture, or kindred subjects will he find his proper vocation. If the middle world is best developed he will be the man for business. 

 He will organize syndicates, indulge in large speculations, head great companies, and be a brilliant figure in the commercial world. If the lower third of the hand be strongest he will be ruled by baser instincts, commoner in his tastes, and fond of show. This is especially marked if the third phalanx of the finger of Apollo is thick. Note carefully if the three worlds are in balance or if one is deficient. Whatever the combination, reason out the result by noting which worlds are present, which absent, and combining the attributes of those found. The fingers must be closely studied. If the fingers of Apollo and Jupiter are of the same length, then we have a balance between ambition and brilliancy which will produce good results. If Apollo is longer than Jupiter, then artistic or business tastes will be in the ascendancy. If Apollo is as long as Saturn, or nearly so, the subject will take great chances in everything, - will risk life, money, reputation, in carrying out his enterprises. He is the plunger, speculator, or gambler. 

 If Apollo is longer than Saturn, he will be the foolhardy gambler, unable to restrain his propensities. If the finger is bent laterally it will add shrewdness to his character, and with the finger extremely long and crooked also, will show the tricky gambler. If the first phalanx is flexible, bending back easily, it will show flexibility in the mental qualities of the type. If the first phalanx is longest, it will show that artistic mental qualities are the strongest, and here is the place you must separate the artistic from the business side of the subject. The first phalanx longest indicates the artist, the writer, the poet, and the subject who will be given to these pursuits. With the second phalanx longest the business side prevails. When the third phalanx is longest, the subject is not destined for art; he will be fond of display and will have common tastes and love flashy colors. If the first and second phalanges are equal in length, then the artistic talents can be made to yield money, as the business and artistic worlds are combined. If the business world is short, the Apollonian may achieve a reputation, but will make little money. If the second and third phalanges are equally long, and the first short, there will only be a desire for money-making, and no artistic quality. This subject will wear flashy clothing and incline to be "shoddy." In judging the phalanges, see which is shortest, and which has gained length at its expense. 

 Estimate what has been taken out of the subject, and what has been furnished in increased supply. The finger tips will add their qualities to the finger and the character. Conic tips will make the subject more artistic and, with the first phalanx longest, add to its qualities the artistic conic qualities. Square tips make them practical and regular in habits, spatulate tips very active and original. With a long first phalanx the square tip will almost equal the presence of a long second phalanx. With the second phalanx longest and conic tip, the subject will add the artistic qualities of the conic tip to the business side of his nature. He will dress well, keep his place of business attractive, and wherever he goes will have artistic things around him. He will be fond of pleasure, and may not keep down to business as closely as he might. If the tip be square it will add common-sense, practical ideas, to an already good business person, and there will be every chance of success. With a spatulate tip he will be very original and make a natural entertainer. All his Apollonian qualities of pleasure-giving have originality and activity added to them, producing a clever after-dinner speaker and a mimic. Pointed tips idealize everything and make him visionary and impractical. When the third phalanx is longest, with conic finger tips, he will be fond of color and form, but with no taste for higher art. With square tips he will desire to be rich, and when so will make a show of his wealth. With spatulate tips he will be fond of games, and will be skilful in them and full of dash. Knotty fingers will check some of his enthusiasm and spontaneity, and are not common to the type. He is not given to analyzing, his mental processes are quicker and more intuitive. Knotty fingers are really a defect, for they make him operate in a manner which is not best for him. 

 Smooth fingers are his natural kind, for artistic feeling, impulsive ways, and great intuition are the main sources of the Apollonian strength. Note the phalanges and see if knotty or smooth-finger qualities are to rule in the world best developed. Long fingers show that minutiae and detail will be strong with the subject. If he is an artist, he will give every detail of the scene he is painting. If a portrait painter, he will reproduce every button, every hair, and every eyelash. If a sculptor, nothing will escape him. If an author, he will describe minutely every character and incident. In business he will be accurate, but more careful than usual for the type; will be a good accountant and office man. Short fingers will make him quick as a flash. 

 He will have added to his already intuitive nature the short-fingered quickness of thought and action, and it will be surprising how quickly he makes a decision. His first impressions are his best. He is in danger of "plunging," however, especially if the Apollo finger be nearly the length of Saturn. The short-fingered Apollonian is always a strong factor in speculation or at the gaming table. The thumb will tell whether strong determination is present to bring out the best side of the type. A large thumb will strengthen the character, and the subject will be more of a "doer" than he would be with a short thumb. The small thumb takes away much of the practical, and leaves the artistic in full sway, but without the will-power necessary to develop it. The short-thumbed Apollonians are geniuses, but never accomplish much. The length of the will phalanx shows the strength of this element, and its shape tells whether the will is coarse, refined, tactful, nervous, or brutal. The second phalanx will show whether good reasoning powers are present, and, by its length, whether there is a balance with the will phalanx greater strength or deficiency. You will thus know whether the subject is ruled by will or reason. A strong second phalanx of the thumb will be a fine addition to any Apollonian, as it adds to his character caution and prudence, which he often sadly needs. A good, clear Head line is necessary to achieve the best results, adding self-control, judgment, and a clear brain. There are many people who have much Apollonian quality in them, but pure specimens of the type are rare. The Apollonian leaven that is mixed with humanity does much to brighten life, and is a constant benefit, not only to the subjects themselves, but to all around them who share in and enjoy their cheerful moods and charming manners.
