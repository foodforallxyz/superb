The first thing to examine in the lines is their character, as their:
- clearness
- depth
- evenness
- whether they are perfect or defective. 
 
If there is a defect, then what is it?
- Does it cover the entire line or only a part of it?
- Is the line repaired after the defect?
- Does it regain its original depth and clearness?
- Does it show diminishing strength until it gradually fades away? 

The first general principle governing lines is:
- the more evenly they run, the clearer they are
- the less they are crossed, broken, islanded, or chained, and the nearer pink in color, the better is the line and the more vigorous and clear the operation of its attributes.

These clear, even lines serve as channels through which the Electric Current can flow. 
- They offer less obstruction to free circulation. 

Conceive the Electric Current to be flowing in and out through the finger ends. You can readily see that:
- all vertical lines facilitate its passage
- all horizontal lines check and impede its progress. 

Thus:
- vertical lines are favorable
- horizontal lines crossing them are defects.

This is why:
- vertical lines on a Mount are good indications and increase the force of its type
- grilles and cross-bars on the Mount are bad indications and obstructions, bringing out the bad side of the type or its health defects. 

The lines operate best when the Current has the least obstruction to its free passage, and defects and bad effects are produced on a subject when it is impeded. 

The slighter the defects and obstructions seen, the less marked are the bad results, and, conversely, the greater the obstruction the worse the effects. Clear, cleanly cut, even, pink lines show the best operation of any line; and every break, cross, island, or obstruction of any kind which may cause the Current to be impeded and to scatter or overflow its banks, will produce a defective operation of the qualities indicated by a line. 

Note whether any one line is deeper or shallower, is more defective, or has a different character in any way from other lines in the hand. If lines in general are of the same size and character, but some one line is much deeper, clearer, better colored than the others, the thing which this deep line indicates will be the strongest thing told by the lines in that subject's hands. 

If all the lines are deep, well colored, and clearly cut, and some one line is found much less clearly cut and deep than the rest, then the quality which that line indicates is the weakest point. Look for proportion constantly, and anything which disturbs it must be used for or against the chances of the subject. 

If the lines in the hand are broad and shallow, instead of deep and clear, there is an imperfect channel for the Current to pass through, and instead of being a deep stream full of strength and power, it is a shallow brook, and the Current spreads over too wide a surface to make it strong. This broad and shallow line is a feeble and weak one, and is generally full of defects and obstructions. 

When you see that lines are clearly cut, deep, well colored, uncrossed, or unspoiled by other defects, these lines show vigor and strength in the operation of their several qualities, steadiness of purpose, evenness of temper, and these are the subjects who, while they may have many difficulties to encounter, overcome them. Broad, shallow, poorly colored lines show weakness, vacillation, and discouragement, and generally these subjects achieve few results, and those are gained only after great effort and with strong outside influences to spur them. All of the changes, obstructions, and defects that occur in the lines themselves have special names, and these we will consider separately. One of the first defective lines to notice is the uneven line (1). 

This is a line which, to a superficial observer, may seem to be a good one, but, upon a close examination, it will be seen that it cuts much deeper in certain parts, becoming thin afterwards, sometimes becoming broad and shallow, and often fading away entirely. Sometimes this uneven line may start broad and shallow, become deep and clear, and then grow thin again. 

The uneven line is one which does not run the same in depth and clearness during its entire length, and yet does not break, island, or show other similar defects. It is its unevenness of character that distinguishes it. This line must be read from its beginning, and if the line starts thin it shows the Current flowing in a thin stream during the length covered by this thinness of the line. 

If it then grows deep, it shows that a great intensity of purpose has been expended during the time covered by this depth, and that the Current was flowing strong and cutting too deeply during this revival, and consequently producing a defect in the line. If, after this depth, the line grows thin again, it shows that the great pressure of Current has been followed by a reaction, and the thin place following the deep one indicates a period when the Current was flowing in a weak manner. 

By following the course of an uneven line from its beginning, and by applying to it the measurements which indicate the ages of life upon the lines, you can locate the periods of strength, weakness, intensity, and all the consequent changes in the life of the subject. The uneven line shows the unequal, spasmodic operation of the qualities of the particular line which is found uneven. Please remember that, in this chapter, we are applying our statements to lines in general and not to particular lines', and the illustrations show in general different formations of uneven lines, all of which may be found on any line. Next to the uneven lines we have those which split (2). 

Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 158 No. 1 These splits are splinters which have broken the lines and produced defects in any line by reducing its clearness and strength, also impairing its usefulness by crippling its ability to carry the Current within the boundaries of the line. These splits must not be mistaken for sister lines, nor for islands, as they do not join the line again after splitting away from it, but must be read as simply split lines, which show a weakened quality of the line during the period of life covered by its continuance on the line. Splits are sometimes very small and fine, and if any doubt exists as to whether a line is split or not, make a careful examination with your glass. 

The true split line leaves the Main line, and does not come back and attach itself to it again. This split line allows a portion of the Current to be diverted from the Main line and changed to some new direction. It is a leak in the line. This divides the strength of the Main line by taking away from it part of its ability to carry the Current in the original direction. These split lines are often the beginning of a new course in the life of the subject. They show that the natural life map may have been altered at the time they occur. Character Of The Lines - Defects, Repair, Strengthening Lines. Part 2 If this is true, the new line will continue to grow in length and pull the Current from its original channel into the new one which is cutting through the hand. 

If split lines run only a short distance and stop, and the Main line continues strong, these split lines will show that the attempts to change the natural course of the life have failed, and while they show by the splits the attempts to change, they also show by their shortness that they did not succeed. The closer these splits lie to the Main line the less likely they are to divert much of the Current. The wider they open away from the line and the deeper and clearer they are, the more importance must be placed upon them, and the more likely they are to produce a change in the course of the life. If a split line pulls away from a line and runs clear and strong to a Mount, it shows no. 2 the great attraction that Mount has for the subject, and such subjects will either strongly partake of the qualities of that Mount or will seek the companionship of subjects of that type. 

This is why older palmists read such lines breaking away from the Heart line as showing that the subject would marry some one of the type represented by the Mount to which this line ran. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 159 When the seven types were less often combined than they are now, and pure specimens of the types were plentiful, it was often easy to describe the color of hair, eyes, etc., of the person a subject would likely marry. 

This was possible by following the description of the appearance of the types indicated by the Mount to which the split line ran. Such feats are still possible when the split lines are strong and the types pure specimens, and while in my own readings I have never said that any subject would marry someone of a particular appearance, I have often described in this way the appearance of the person who would be most attractive to the subject as one who would be his ideal, and whom he would prefer to any other for a life partner. 

The split line will tell of many events, ranging from a mere trivial defect of the line, shown by a small short split, up to an entire change in the life of a subject. There must always be a distinct separation of a line, showing that it plainly divides, before you should read it as a split. With care and practice you can learn properly to judge such defects. 

During the study of this chapter examine as many hands as possible, looking for each of the signs and lines as treated here, and accustom yourself to recognize at once the different formations, not trying to interpret them fully at first, but learning to distinguish them quickly when seen. 

Remember that a divided line is not as strong by one half as if the split had not occurred, and this will give you the proper general theory to apply to split lines. The next defect is the island (3). This sign is one which has been misunderstood and improperly handled by many palmists. In the first place the island is not a single sign, but is produced by the splitting of a line and the return to the original line of the lower end of the part which has broken away. 

Chance lines which merely cross each other in such a way as to make the same shaped figure as an island (see 3 B) do not form a true island. The fact that the ends of these chance lines overlap each other, constituting defects for each other, may spoil the operation of both the chance lines, but it does not form a true island. One fact I wish to strongly impress, - that a true island is produced by a splitting of the Main line, and a return of the split to the Main line, and that islands are formed in no other way. Islands of all sizes are found, ranging from those which are mere dots and distinguished only under the glass, to those which sweep wide circles in the hand and instantly attract your attention. Whenever you find a figure in the shape of an island, make yourself sure that it is produced by a splitting of the line before pronouncing it an island. 

If it is formed by two chance lines crossing each other, or by a chance line crossing a Main or Minor line at both ends, read the chance lines separately and not as an island. The only reason why palmists have been at all successful in handling the island according to the present acceptation of what constitutes an island, is that the effect of chance lines crossing each other is similar to some of the bad effects of the island, and it has not been because the island itself has been thoroughly understood. The island is always a defect, always a disturber, a warning to look out for something, and must never be disregarded. The operation of an island is to divide the Current flowing along a line. One half of the Current passes around one side of the island, the other half going around the other side. These divided currents reunite on the lower side of the island and resume their course. 

The word "island" is taken from its geographical namesake, and the true island in the hand is literally what its name implies, an isolated surface of skin surrounded by the divided line. Thus the island is an impeding object in no. 3 the course of a line, which divides the strength of the Current, producing a consequent division of strength and force. The size and length of the island shows the extent of obstruction and its duration, and from the point at which it is seen on a line you can read the age at which this weakening of the force occurs. It is not the intention here to do more than to impress upon you the general meaning of the island. Its specific application will be made to each line as we study it. 

When an island is seen remember the divided stream, the impeding, obstructing island, and the consequent weakness and impairment of the line during its presence, and you will always think of a menace to the subject from some direction. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 160 Breaks in the lines (4) are frequently encountered, and always indicate a defective condition. In this case the Current is interrupted and stopped in exactly the same manner as when a telegraph wire is cut. The kind of a break will make a great difference in the outcome of the defect, and it is only by the Electric Current theory that you will be able to judge correctly and quickly what the seriousness of any break in the line is. The theory is this =  when the Current reaches the break it is checked, and some repair process is needed at once, else the Current will flow out of all regular channels, producing the same condition as the overflow of a river which is not properly confined within its banks, that of spreading destruction. 

If the break in a line is small, and the line continues clearly after the break and in a direct course, the Current may skip over the small break and continue in its regular path. In this case the danger is serious, but not insurmountable. In such an instance the two ends of the line will probably grow together eventually. The wider the break, the more serious it becomes and the less likelihood there is of the Current's passing over the space between the broken ends. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 161 No. 4. Everything tending to make it easier to hold the Current in its proper course, or enabling it to get back to it after a break occurs, lessens the serious results of the broken line, and everything that makes it harder for the Current to continue its course without interruption adds to the complication. Thus broken lines may be repaired when the broken ends overlap each other, or by a small cross-line uniting the ends of the two lines, by sister lines running alongside of the line and break, or by squares (5); all of which means help transmit the Current from the broken end of the line to its regular channel, and while during this break and its repair there is a decided check to the best operation of the line, still it is possible of repair, and not so serious as if unaccompanied by any sign of repair. Always a danger, breaks must be regarded seriously, and from their size, or the repair signs present, you can accurately estimate their outcome. One of the worst forms to encounter is when the end of the line turns back after a break and starts to run towards its source (6), forming thus a sort of hook. 

This probably led the old palmists to use this indication found in the Life line as denoting a fatal termination, and you have read perhaps that the "Life line broken and turning toward the thumb means death." In this case the Current turns back upon itself, and finds it harder to continue its course with such a break than in any other formation; it overflows where there is no channel to carry it forward. If there is no means by which this Current can be carried back to its original course, it produces disaster. There are various methods of repair, some by lines joining the turned-back end of the Main line, by sister lines, squares, or various lines which will attract the Current and take it back no. 5 Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 162Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 163 No. 6 to its regular channel. These methods of repair are shown in Fig. 6. Every turned-back line is a most serious check to the subject, either as to life, health, or career; the line on which it is found will tell in which direction this check leads. If unrepaired it is well-nigh fatal, even worse than when the line ends abruptly, for in the latter case the Current may be forced through new paths, and may dig itself a new channel; but when it is deliberately turned back to its source there is little hope that it will ever go on in its original direction. Of all repair signs the best and most certain is the square, shown in Fig. 7 The Square (7) is an individual sign, and has been used by the old palmists as an indication of protection from some impending danger. It is always a good sign, wherever found. No matter what the break in a line, or what its menace to the subject, a square surrounding it will partially repair and mitigate the danger. 

The square I conceive to be a box which forms itself around the break or danger point, and concentrates and boxes in the Current, making escape impossible, holding the overflow in check, and forcing the Current to find and discharge itself again through the regular channel, no matter how great the turmoil inside of the square may be. Sometimes a square is found on a Mount, where it does not surround a defect in a line. Such squares will indicate that the defects of the Mount will not predominate with this subject. My conception is that lines are channels for the transmission of the Electric Current, and that our effort is to find out how well they can and will perform this function. If the Life Current has an unobstructed channel across the hand, the life will be unobstructed. But if the channel shows defects at a certain point we know trouble is going to occur there, and that if the Current is kept in the channel and from breaking its bounds and overflowing, the danger will be overcome. When the defective place is boxed in by the square, we feel that the Current cannot get out of the box, but must find and discharge itself through its regular channel. Thus a square is always a protection from danger, a boxing in of the Current, and a repair agent of certainty and reliability. In thousands of examinations I have never failed to verify this estimate of the square. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 164 No. 7 The Fork and the Tassel (8) are found at the termination of lines, and by applying the general theory to them they are easy to understand. The termination of a line shows the end of the operation of its peculiar qualities, and must be noted to see in what manner the end will be accomplished. Some lines gradually fade away until the line is lost in the capillary lines of the skin; in other cases the line ends abruptly, sometimes with a cross, a star, a dot, or an island, and often it terminates in a fork or tassel. These tassels may be found on the end of a short Life, Head, or Heart line, and, whenever found, indicate the dissipation and diffusion of the strength of the line and the end of its usefulness. 


The Current, instead of continuing, is scattered and diffused, and spreads itself like a tassel or fan, dissipating its force, and ending the strong operation of the qualities indicated by the line. If a fork composed of two lines occur in the end of a line, it amounts only to a split, and is not so bad as a tassel, for this split may form itself into an island and continue the line; but the tassel, composed of many lines, is the distribution of the Current over so wide a space there is no hope that it will be gathered together again in a single strong line, though, if it occur early in the line and not at its end, you may sometimes find a single thin line continuing after a tassel. In some cases you find the tassel protected by a square. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 165 No. 8 Character Of The Lines - Defects, Repair, Strengthening Lines. Part 4 The tassel is always a defect, sometimes overcome, but producing while it lasts great disturbance of the Current. By following the theory of the Current over the line, you can accurately estimate the extent of seriousness, the possible repair, and the outcome, though a tassel generally marks the end of the usefulness of a line. The Dot (9) is a sign which is not frequently seen, but is worthy of note. It varies in size and depth, some being mere specks, and others large enough to put in the point of a pencil. Dots are always a defect, either of a line, when seen on one, or they may be found independent of the lines. On a line the dot forms an obstruction to the flow of the Current, and if it is a large one it produces destruction of the line by interposing so deep a cavity that the Current cannot pass. 

Very small dots are not serious, but often come after severe illness, generally of a febrile character. I have seen, dots on the Life line marking the spot when a severe attack of scarlet or typhoid fever had occurred, on the Head line under the Mount of Saturn in deaf and dumb subjects, under the Mount of Apollo in heart-disease subjects, on the line of Mercury showing when severe intestinal disturbances had occurred, and in other parts of the hand indicating the occurrence of difficulties peculiar to the parts of the hand on which they were seen. Dots may be red, blue, white, or yellow, and will indicate by their color the disturbances peculiar to the locality or line on which they appear. They are subject to repair by a good square. The Chained line (10) is formed by the joining together of a number of links, forming a line not clear, even, and deep, but one which has a continuous series of obstructions from the beginning. The effect of such a line is the weak operation of the qualities of the line. If it is the Head line, it makes a vacillating subject, lacking in self-control, and liable to headaches and other brain disturbances. If chains are seen in only part of a line, the weak, poor operation of the line will occur only during the period occupied by the chained condition, though the line following the chain is apt to be thin. 

The chains make it impossible for the Current to flow freely and evenly through the line, in which case the channel is full of shallows over which the stream makes its way with difficulty. It is a labored, strained, obstructed condition, consequently the chain is always a serious defect. It is one of the hardest lines to repair, for, unless the chain is very short, it takes a square larger and more regularly placed than is usual in order to enclose the chain. In almost all hands the chain is repaired by a sister line, or lines, and in no other way. The chain is seen on nervous Life lines, and on sentimental and deficient Heart lines, sometimes on Head lines, but not often on the other Main or Minor lines or chance lines. Remember in reading it, that it is a shallow, obstructed channel, and form your estimate from this basis, applying the weak operation of the Current to that part of the line covered by the chained condition, and estimating how much it is repaired by any sister lines which may be present.

The Triangle (11) is often a single sign, though triangles are frequently found in the course of a line, in which case carefully note whether the triangle is formed by the splitting of the line, as in the case of an island, or whether it is a sign by itself and has formed over the line. Triangles are sometimes formed by crossing of the Main lines. In that case they do not have all of the power which belongs to them as single signs. 

When a well-marked triangle is not formed by Main or Minor lines, and when the lines at the angles do not overlap each other, but make well-cut points, it shows great mental brilliancy of the line, Mount, or finger on which it is seen. On the Mount of Jupiter it will tell of lofty ambitions and Jupiterian mental qualities; on the Mount of Moon, of brilliant imagination. It must always be used as showing brilliancy of mental attributes, and is never a health indication. 

If the triangle is formed by crossing chance lines it is not as powerful in its operation as when it is a single sign, still it adds greatly to the subject in whatever direction its location indicates. On all of the Mounts a triangle applies only to the upper world of that Mount. It is not intended here to apply the single signs to the Mounts, fingers, lines, and individual phalanges, giving their meaning in each location, but to outline the general principles governing them, and in a subsequent chapter to apply them. Remember the strongest triangle is the single sign, that it is always a favorable indication, never applies to health, but adds brilliancy to the mental side of the location where it is found. 

<!-- Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 168 No. 11. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 169 No. 12.  -->

The Grille (12) is a formation where lines are found crossing each other in such a manner as to form a network or dam through which it is almost impossible for the Current to pass; as, for example, if an Electric Current were turned into a wire netting, when we know it would zigzag in every direction, be obstructed so it could not continue its passage, and would be forced to escape through the ends of each wire in the net. This would diffuse and dissipate the Current. It would also intensely electrify the point where the diffusion occurred. In the lines of the hand we must keep the Current free from obstruction, so when the grille is found in any hand, we feel at once that if a deep line shows that much Current is flowing in its direction, we have in the grille obstruction and overflow. Whenever seen, the grilling of lines is a serious defect and a menace. 

If it is very pronounced, and composed of deep red lines, the menace is great; if only a confusing and interlacing of several small thin lines, it is not as serious. On the Mounts the grille is a bad sign, bringing out the bad side of the Mount types, since by causing the exciting Electric Current to overflow into them it produces an abnormal condition. It also brings out prominently their health defects. Character Of The Lines - Defects, Repair, Strengthening Lines. Part 5 When a grille is seen on any Mount, look for a bad or spoiled specimen of the type, or one who has the health defects peculiar to his type. A square may repair a grille if it boxes the defect entirely, but such markings are rare, and even so beneficial a sign as the square cannot entirely dissipate the danger of a grille. Note the lines in a grille to see if they are deep or shallow, and if in proportion to the rest of the lines in the hand, weaker than they or stronger. If the grille is very strong, deep, and red-lined it will be more pronounced in its bad effects; if its lines are less deep than the other lines, it is less of a danger. 

See whether the vertical lines cut their way through the cross lines (in which case it will not be so bad a grille) or if the cross lines cut the vertical lines cleanly. Some Current can pass if the vertical lines cut their way through; none can get through if the cross-lines cut the deepest. A grille with lines not running exactly vertical and horizontal is not as bad as one which is found composed of vertical and horizontal lines running at right angles. Thus with all grilles gauge with judgment your estimate of their destructive force, and do not apply the worst effect of a bad grille to a less dangerous one. Carefully estimate the good of your subject by Chirognomy in order to get the true effect of the grille as applied to him, and always use great care with this sign. Cross-bars (13), or horizontal lines closely grouped together without the vertical lines of the grille, I consider a worse indication than the grille itself, for in this case the Current is entirely bloeked and has no chance to escape except by overflowing the obstruction, and to do this it must first overflow the surrounding parts. I have given the name of Cross-bars to this marking, as I have often encountered it as a single sign and verified its bad effects.

The cross-bars will bring out the bad side of a Mount, such as health defects, and fortunately are not often found. When you encounter this sign, see how strong and deep are the cross-lines, also how they compare with the rest of the lines in the hand. The deeper they are, the worse the indication, and vice versa. The Current theory will always unlock their seriousness. The Circle (14) is quite a rare sign, and is chiefly valuable when found on the line of Life, or on the Mount of Apollo, or line of Head under the Mount of Apollo. 

Such markings emphasize the Apollonian tendency to trouble with the eyes. This indication I have verified in a few instances. When seen it will be accurate as indicating delicacy of the eyes, but is not seen on the hands of all who are either blind, have poor vision, or weak eyes. It is not usually perfectly marked. Imperfect circles sometimes close their edges, however, and become perfect in shape as the difficulties with the eyes increase. 

Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 170 No. 13. Character Of The Lines Defects And Repair Individu 171 No. 14. The Trident (15) is found at the upper end of a line, is sometimes a single sign, and sometimes is connected with either the lines of Saturn, Apollo, or Mercury, or with a chance line that runs in a vertical direction. It is a favorable indication when found on the upper end of a line, as it allows a good escape of the Current through proper channels. It adds strength to the line of Apollo, increasing its brilliancy and the chances of success for the subject. 

The trident is a rare marking and always & good one. It must be perfectly marked to give its full meaning. The Star (16) is an important and valuable sign. It is found in many hands, in all possible locations, and is sometimes a good indication, sometimes a bad one, depending entirely upon its location. As the Current flows along the lines it is ready at any moment to burst into a flame and illuminate its surroundings. Just as the Electric Current produces the electric light, so the Life Current also produces periods or points of illumination. 

The star is the electric light of Palmistry, the place at which the Current sends out its points of light from a common centre; and thus the star, if small and even in proportion, means illumination, and if large and diffused, explosion. It is always a lighting up and intensifying indication wherever seen. Be careful in handling stars to note their formation, size, depth of lines, location, and relative proportion to the rest of the lines. 

You will see stars perfectly formed, with each ray of the same length and coming from a common centre, forming a perfectly proportioned marking. These are the best stars, and give the even illumination that lights up a Mount or line without destroying it. When the star is imperfectly formed and the lines do not proceed from a common centre it is a poor star, partaking of the defects of a grille and producing feeble light, and is in no sense so brilliant a marking as the perfect star. If the star is large, with deep, red lines, and a deep dot for the centre, it is the explosion which destroys, as does the boiler which bursts. 

On the Life line it means sudden death, on the Head line it means an explosion in the mental faculties, or insanity, and wherever found this large, deep star is excess, which means danger. Instead of having to memorize the meaning of a star in all of its locations, fix in your mind the Current theory and the fact that the star is the light or the explosion, according to its formation. Whenever seen, instead of trying to remember what it means in each location, simply say =  " What will this kind of a star do for the subject when located in the position in which I find it? 

Will it light up and make more brilliant, or will it explode and destroy? "If you have correctly judged the kind of a star, you can apply either its brilliancy or its explosive force to the location or line on which you find it. This is the only correct and at the same time simple way to read stars. It is such an important sign, and so often found, that you must be able to read it quickly and correctly whenever it is met. 

Only the general theory of the star is intended to be made plain here =  the application will be made to different lines and Mounts later. The star is the illumination, the electric light, making brilliant if a good one, but the danger signal or explosion if too large, deep cut, and red.

The Cross (17) is a common sign. It is sometimes a well-marked single sign, and sometimes is formed by lines crossing other lines. Always note how deep the lines forming it are, and how they are in proportion to the other lines. A deep-cut cross is a sign of grave import, especially if highly colored. The cross is an obstacle or a defect, and generally produces either a bad quality, a health defect, or a change in the course of the subject's life. The Current running along the line on reaching the cross "burns out the fuse," to use electrical parlance, and a stoppage for repair is necessary, often with the result of changing the course of the subject's life. In any location it must be regarded as unfavorable, and as indicating a defect. 

In the repair of any line, weak, broken, or defective in any way, Sister lines (18) are most valuable. Whenever you see a weakness or a defect in any line, look to see if a sister line runs alongside, adding its strength or repairing qualities. A weak line with a sister line makes a good combination, almost as good as a single strong line. Good lines are made better by sister lines, and in every place they appear regard a sister line as of decided benefit. 

The study of the general characteristics of the lines and signs of which this chapter treats is the keystone to the study of the individual lines and combinations. I have been explicit concerning each change in the lines, all defects, and the way individual signs are produced, as I wish to get the general theory of the Current well fixed in your mind. The application of this hypothesis to the individual lines makes it easy to read their innumerable variations, and it is only this conception of the Electric Current which will make it possible to reason out all of the possible combinations of lines you will be called upon to read.
