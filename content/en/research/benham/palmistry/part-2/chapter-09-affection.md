The lines of Affection or Marriage:
- are on the Mount of Mercury
- run from the percussion toward the inside of the palm.

In some hands, there are none of these lines. In others, many are seen.

From time immemorial they have been used by older palmists as indications of marriage or unions of the sexes.

Their value in practice is considerable if used up to their limit, and in combination, but used by themselves, as a hard-and-fast indication of marriage, they will lead to constant error.

Marriage does not affect every subject in the same way. Some people are no more impressed on entering into this relation than if they were performing any ordinary routine of daily life.
Such persons will have no Marriage lines.

Others sink their whole life and soul into a union, and these will have deep Marriage lines.
To use the word "marriage" in connection with the lines of Affection is misleading, for it is in no sense to be taken as always indicating a legal marriage contract.

These lines are often seen when no such contract has ever been entered into, but when the subject has loved as fondly as if he had been joined in wedlock.

In such subjects a line of union will appear the same as though the ceremony had been performed.
More properly speaking, these are lines of deep affection rather than lines of marriage or union, and, viewed from this standpoint, they are remarkably accurate.

In every case there must have been a profound impression made upon the subject by an affection before these lines will be strong, and the more impressions and affections which have existed, the more of these lines of Affection will be seen in the hand.

The Lines Of Affection 464 No. 313.

The type of the subject will always be a great aid in reading the lines of Affection, as each type has distinct views on the marriage question.

The Jupiterian is inclined to marriage and to marry young. So in the hand of a Jupiterian a line of Affection early in life will most often be correctly read as marriage.
The Saturnian dislikes marriage ; if he be of a very pronounced or at all bad development, and even in good specimens of the type, a Saturnian does not rush into the marriage state.
This type does not naturally love his fellow-creatures, and a most profound impression must be made on him by someone before he will enter the marriage relation.
Consequently in the hand of a Saturnian a line of Affection should be very strong, and occur well toward middle life, before you are justified in reading it as marriage.

Even when the combination of a Mount of Venus shows a Saturnian to be possessed of sexual desire, he will prefer to gratify these appetites outside of the marriage state rather than to tie himself permanently to anyone.

Apollonians desire to marry, and do so when young. But they often make unhappy marriages because while they like brilliant partners they do not always get them.

Lines of Affection on Apollonians will be quite safely read as marriages.

Mercurians are great matchmakers. They also marry quite young.

On this type, lines of Affection will very often mean marriage.
Martians are prone to marry, so with this type lines of Affection also have full meaning.
Lunarians are very peculiar about marriage, sometimes despising it, and sometimes making odd matches, and the line of Affection on this type must be excessively strong to be read as marriage. Venusians cannot keep from marrying, even if they cared to, for they will not be allowed to remain single, because other persons are so attracted to them.
On the Venusian type it requires only a small line to mean marriage, though on this type you will generally find strong lines.

The practice of looking at the Mount of Mercury, and predicting one, two, or as many marriages as there are lines of Affection on the Mount, is a most inaccurate and unscientific thing to do, constantly leading to error, and making our science ridiculous.
No practitioner should say in advance, as is the custom with many professionals, that he can tell about marriage.
Many professionals in their printed circulars claim to tell a client "everything concerning love, marriage, divorce, etc.," and such professionals are kept continually in hot water by their mistakes.
If they did not promise what they could not perform, there would be no trouble. The only honest way is to make no promises, for you cannot tell what a hand will show until it has been seen.

It may be asked, "Why is it necessary to deal with marriage at all?" The answer to this question is, that marriages do so much to make or to mar the career that all the information possible should be had for use in its general bearing upon the life of a subject. My only object in introducing the lines of Affection at this point is that we may be able to bring them to bear upon the lines of Saturn and Apollo, which they often powerfully influence. The first thing to determine is whether lines of Affection be present or absent. If none be seen, your subject is not likely to be powerfully impressed by anyone. 

If the subject be robust, and belong to an ardent type, he may have strong desires toward the opposite sex, but when these are satisfied, he relapses into a state of indifference, until the superabundance of vitality again turns his thoughts in the same direction. These subjects are undemonstrative, and a defective Heart line in a hand which has no line of Affection will indicate heart disease and not affection. If many lines of Affection be present (314) the subject is susceptible in affairs of the heart, more or less seriously so as the lines are strong or weak. These lines of Affection are always cross-lines, and start from the outside of the hand, sometimes at the back cutting around into the Mount of Mercury. If only a single line be seen, there will be but one deep affection, and it must be stated here that the lines of Affection relate only to persons of the opposite sex, and those who are in no way related to us by blood. They are never an indication of the love a subject may have for his family. The Lines Of Affection 465 No. 314.

If a line of Affection begin with a fork (315) it shows that the affection is of unusual strength, the two lines of the fork having united to form a single line, producing the effect of two Currents turned into one, which thus takes on double strength. To read the age on lines of Affection, two methods are employed. One is to determine at what age the affection occurs, and the other to tell how long it lasts. 

In order to determine the age at which an affection occurs, take the Heart line as a lower mark, and the top of the Mount of Mercury as the upper. This space must be subdivided into the average years of life, bringing the middle of the Mount at thirty-six, and the top at seventy years. Thus all lines of Affection appearing before the middle of the Mount occur before the age of thirty-six, and those appearing beyond the centre of the Mount occur after 36. The scale (316) will be found approximating the correct ages and accurate enough for all general purposes. 

It can, however, be still further subdivided if more exact dates are desired. To determine the length an affection endures, the line itself must be measured from its beginning to its termination. In this way also events in the course of an affection are often recorded. The scale of measurement for such readings begins with the starting of the line and ends with its termination, the line to be divided in the middle as age thirty-six, and seventy to be recorded at the end. The intervening years can be subdivided as minutely as is necessary in order to reach the age of any markings on the line which is desired (317). 

The longer the line of Affection, the longer the affection continues, and when a number of lines are seen the duration of each affair may be estimated by the length of the several lines. The age at which each occurs is read from the Mount subdivided, and the duration from the length of the line. 

By this method read the number of strong attachments the subject has had and how long each one lasts, and by the longest and deepest line determine which one has been deeper than the rest (318). This marking will indicate several deep attachments, finally culminating in the all-absorbing affection shown by the deep line. If two lines run alongside of each other and are of the same depth (319) the subject has loved two persons equally well at the same time. 

In every case the highest line of Affection is the last one which has occurred, and any lines lower than it will record former affections. If a number of lines be seen, the upper one a deep line, but one of the early lines deep at the end, it indicates that the early love has never entirely disappeared (320). From every combination of lines select the strongest attachments from the deepest lines, and also determine by the character of the lines how completely this attachment has passed away. If the last Hue be a thin one, and yet by its length and confirmatory signs proves to be the Marriage line, and if a stronger line lie close under it (321) the subject has married for convenience, or money, but not from strongest love.

If the lines of Affection be thin in proportion to other lines in the hand, the subject has no real strong affections. He has a brotherly or sisterly affection for the one he marries, but love will not be the absorbing passion. These subjects giving little demonstration of affection are indifferent, cold, and, if they have many lines of Affection, are apt to be flirts. If such Subjects be handsome and attractive they break many hearts. If in a woman's hand the lines of Affection are broad and shallow, or chained, the subject is still more indifferent. She will lead suitors on for the pleasure of disappointing them. These subjects have no real affection, and are selfish, cold, and cruel. White color will add to the coldness of both of these latter lines. The lines which show deep, lasting affection, are the deep and well-cut ones. These are strengthened if they be also pink or red in color. Such subjects love ardently, constantly, and make sacrifices for those they love. It is their pleasure and pride to be constant and true. If such a deep line run to its end without fault or break, the subject will pursue a life of ardent attachment, of reliability and steadfastness, from beginning to end. If the line start deep and gradually grow thin the subject will gradually lose the strength of his attachment (322). If the line start thin and gradually become stronger the subject will grow stronger in his attachment (323). If an island appear on the line of Affection, there will be some unhappiness during the course of the affection (324). If the line of Affection be composed of islands, the subject will never have affection enough for anyone to marry him (325). If a cross be seen on the line of Affection there will be a serious impediment to the affection (326). If this line end in a star the affection will terminate in an explosion (327). If a line of Affection send a branch into the Mount of Apollo which ends in a star, the subject will have an affection for someone brilliant and famous (328). If the line of Affection fork at its termination (329), the affection will separate and become less strong. This has been used by the older palmists as an indication of divorce. It is a likelihood of interference in the married life, but not always divorce. It shows the beginning of the dissipation of the affections. 

If the fork be not wide (330) the estrangement is not so serious as if it diverge greatly, as in No. 329. If the line end in a trident or a tassel, it shows the utter dissipation and scattering of the affection (331). If branches droop from the line of Affection the married life will be full of sorrows and disappointments (332). If branches rise from the line of Affection, the subject will be uplifted and the affection will be a benefit to him (333). If the line be broken it will indicate that the affection is interfered with or broken in some way (334).

Look for repair signs. If the break be enclosed in a square the subject will recover the disturbed affection (335). If the line make a hook on the Mount, the subject will lose his affection, which will not be regained (336). If a dot be seen on a line of Affection, it indicates an impediment to the course of the affections (337), the termination of the line showing the outcome, for if the line end in a fork, trident, or tassel the affection will be dissipated (338). 

If after the dot the line grows thin, the affection disappears gradually (339) If Worry lines run from the Mount of Venus to the lines of Affection, and cut these lines, it shows that relatives are interfering with the married life of the subject (340). If the cutting line run from Influence lines on the Mount of Venus, it can be determined how close is the kinship of the relative who is causing the difficulty. 

If a line from a close line of Influence cut a forked line of Affection, the married life of the subject will be interfered with by a near relative (341). The forked line shows that the subject loses some enjoyment of the marriage relation through this interference. If the line of Affection end in a tassel, the reading is intensified (342). 

If a line of Affection cut by a bar have a chance line running to an island, a cross, a bar, or a dot in the Head line, an interference with the married life of the subject will result in some form of brain disturbance (343). In this manner chance lines will be seen running from obstructions in the line of Affection to various parts of the hand, sometimes to defective Life lines, or health defects of the Mounts. 

In all these cases the trouble pointed to will be brought on by an interference or blemish seen in the line of Affection. Each one of these defects in the line of Affection will indicate an event in the life of the subject. In all cases the lines of Affection should be read in combination with Influence lines on the Mount of Venus. As both relate to the coming into the life of a new factor, viz., someone outside of the subject himself, they are interdependent.

Be careful interpreting the marriage and home life. The real object of an examination of the hand is to give a client a better knowledge of himself. 

Unless the matter of marriage is so interwoven with his existence that the two seem inseparable, it is only gratifying curiosity to deal with it, and does no real good. When his career is being ruined or interfered with by adverse influences, these matters should be pointed out. Merely to tell about them in order to show whether you can do it or not, is lowering the standard of the profession. 

A surgeon would not amputate a limb to show that he knew how, but he would do so if the limb needed amputating and the operation would help the patient. All palmists should proceed upon that idea. Do what is necessary for the help or guidance of the client, but nothing merely to exhibit skill. A strict adherence to this principle will win in the long run, and nowhere more surely than in the matter of the lines of Affection.
