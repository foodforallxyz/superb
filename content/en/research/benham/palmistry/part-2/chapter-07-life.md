THE line of Life is<!-- , according to our hypothesis, --> the third line which receives the Electric Current upon its entrance through the finger of Jupiter.

This line:
- rises at the side of the hand under the finger of Jupiter
- encircles the Mounts of Lower Mars and Venus
- in most cases ends under the Mount of Venus at the base of the hand.

The line of Life indicates:
- the health of the subject during the various periods of life
- his physical strength in general, and
- whether he lives during each period on his nervous force or relies upon muscular robustness. 

It records many detailed events in his life, and forms a basis to fall back upon when seeking confirmations or explanations of indications found elsewhere in the hand. 

It shows whether the course of the life is upward or downward, and will fix the year when the zenith of the subject's powers are reached. 

In many cases it also shows:
- the probable termination of the life, and
- often by what disease or agency. 

<!-- If you ask, "Why does the line of Life show these things?" we must answer, "We do not know, unless our hypothesis that the lines are the life map of the subject be correct."  -->

Thousands of recorded cases in the past prove, beyond a doubt, that these facts can and have been obtained from the line of Life.<!-- , and, reasoning from past to present, we feel confident that the same information may still be secured from the same source.  -->

<!-- If our hypothesis is not correct, it works out just the same as if it were, and in the absence of any better explanation of the phenomena of the Life line, we must, for the present at least, rest upon the statement that  -->

The Life line is the map of the natural course of the subject's life. 

It shows:

1. The subject's health
2. his physical strength

<!-- , we cannot deny that with a knowledge of his state of health, general vitality, and physical strength in our possession, we would be poor reasoners indeed if we could not take such information and from these causes figure out their results. It is from such a basis that the present work upon the Life line has been deduced, and many experiments prove it to be correct. 

The Line Of Life 325 No. 174. The Line Of Life 326 No. 17S.  -->

There is little use in discussing an absence of the Life line, for few cases will be found where none is present. 

A great variation will be found in the length of lines, but where it seems at first sight to be absent you will in nearly every case discover a remnant of it, showing that the line has existed in some form. 


## Absent Life Line

I have seen a few cases where no Life line at all was present (175), and in such cases have found that the subject had but little muscular strength and vitality, but has lived on nervous energy. 

These people:
- were subject to many nervous collapses
- had constantly to husband the strength
- sleep much
- avoid excitement.

The absence of a Life line simply shows that the life of the subject hangs only by a hair, and for such an one Death is a visitor who may come at any moment. 

These subjects have never lived in a robust condition, but have always been delicate. 

<!-- In the beginning of your study of the Life line, I wish to say that  -->

A big thumb and a good Head line indicate qualities that often overcome the poorest Life line, prolonging the life far past its natural ending place. 

In no case, therefore, should absolute statements be made that death will come at a given time, for, while you may see great danger, willpower may be strong enough to wrest life from death. 

It is far better for your subject's course through life that some kind of a line be present, even though it may be a weak one, for in this case there is some resistance, some vital force, while with the absent line all energy depends upon the nerves, and when these give way collapse ensues. 

You will sometimes find it difficult to distinguish the Life line from the Saturn line (176) or from strong influence lines found inside of the Life line (177). 

In 176 the inside line is the Life line, though the second or Saturn line takes up a part of the Life line's function from the time the Life line leaves off. In 177 the outside line is the Life line, and the inner line gives it strength. 

<!-- As a guide in all such cases remember that  -->

The Life line should enclose the Mount of Venus and not run on top of it. This will help you properly distinguish the Life line from other lines. 

The Life line usually rises at the side of the hand under Jupiter (178). 
- This is the normal source, and marks the beginning of the life. 

Sometimes, however, the line rises from the Mount of Jupiter (179).
- This shows that the life is a most ambitious one, ailed with desires for wealth, success, and fame, and that the subject will take every opportunity to become acquainted with people of note. 

If he be a Saturaian, he is ambitious for success along Saturnian, lines, such as occult studies, physics, chemistry, medicine. 

<!-- The Line Of Life 327 No. 176. The Line Of Life 328 No. 177. The Line Of Life 329 No. 178. The Line Of Life 330 No. 179.  -->

Farming, mining, or is greedy for money, according to which phalanx of the Saturn finger rules. If he be an Apollonian, he is ambitious for success and fame as an artist, as a money maker, or as one who makes a display in the world, according to which phalanx of the finger rules. 

If he be a Mercurian, he is ambitious as an orator, a scientist, or in money matters, according to the ruling phalanx of this finger. The same reasoning applies to the other Mounts. 

In all cases this subject will be extremely proud. It is seldom that any other source is seen for the Life line than that shown in 178, and if any other combination is encountered it must be reasoned out from the qualities belonging to that part of the hand from which the line rises. 

In its course through the hand the Life line varies little, the principal deflections being when the line runs close to the thumb (180), in which case it reduces the size of the Mount of Venus, thus checking the operation of that Mount, and the subject is cold, unsympathetic, lacks sexual desire and attraction for or to the opposite sex. 

This is a most important marking when you desire to estimate the probability of a fruitful marriage, for the less Venusian sexual desire present, the less likely is the subject to have children. 

The Line Of Life 331 No. 180. It shows one who repels advances from the opposite sex instead of courting them, and for such reasons this line was used by the older palmists as an indication of barrenness. It may for the above reasons produce this condition, but it is not per se an indication of sterility. 

The Line Of Life Part 2 332 No. 181. 

This restriction of the Life line is also an indication of a diminished probability for long life, as it shows an abnormal dryness in the subject, and such conditions do not show the health and vigor that are present in subjects full of desire and warmth. Coldness indicates nearness to death, either of the physical body, or, as in this case, of some necessary emotion. When the line sweeps wide into the palm (181) it increases the boundary and scope of the Mount of Venus. 

All things which increase the size of the Mount increase its powers and effectiveness. This subject will be ardent, full of desire and warmth, passionate, generous, sympathetic, and will attract others. He will also be strongly attracted, will marry early, and in ninety-nine per cent, of cases the union will be fruitful. This comes from the converse of the reasoning applied to the restricted line. This converging line also indicates long life and a strong vitality and constitution. It is the presence of warmth as opposed to cold. 

Generally:
- the longer the line of Life, the longer will be the life of the subject
- the shorter the line, the shorter will it be. 

<!-- Experience has proven, however, that this general proposition, while in the main true, -->

But this is still capable of considerable variation. If taken absolutely as stated, it may lead to error. <!-- , and this must be reduced to the minimum. --> 

In my examinations of the hands of dead persons:
- many startling confirmations of their death have been found on the Life line
- but other dead persons have well-marked Life lines which run past the age of their death.

This might lead to the belief that the Life line is inaccurate if we did not understand the matter. 

**The fact is that the Life line shows the vigor and natural health of the subject.** 

But death is marked on the Heart line, Head line, Mercury line, and is indicated by chance lines and individual signs as well, and in those hands where death has occurred and the Life line is found intact, the indication of death is present in one of the other places mentioned (see hand of Albert Frantz).

It is because severe illnesses and death have been looked for on the Life line only, that so little proficiency has been attained in palm-reading. 

The Life line has been expected to perform a greater duty than it was able to do, and received the blame for ill-success that belonged to the practitioner alone. 

The indications of death were in <!-- each --> the hand of those who have died from disease, accident, violence, hanging, or electrocution. 
- These have been absolutely verified such premises if only they were sought in the proper place. 
- Sometimes that place was in the Life line, sometimes in other lines. 

<!-- This matter I desire to make very clear at this point, for it will prevent your falling into the same mistakes which have overtaken others.  -->

When the line is found strong, good, and long, we may safely assume that the strong constitution will uphold that life in its natural course until old age is reached. 
- The shorter the line, the shorter is the period that this vitality will remain <!-- in full operation --> and the sooner will the subject have to depend on a careful handling of his forces to ensure the continuance of life. 

The two hands are most necessary in the examination of the Life line. 
- A naturally strong constitution shown by a long, deep line in the left hand may be found ruined in the right hand by a chained line.

In every case, you can read:
- the natural condition correctly from the left hand
- the present state from the right hand. 

These changes will be shown by the character of the line. 

You will often encounter a short Life line in one hand and a long one in the other. 

If the longer line occur in the right hand, this must be read as prolonging of life and strengthening of constitution. 

If the shorter is in the right hand, it must be read as the shortening of the life. 

<!-- Nowhere is it necessary to use both hands more continually than in examinations of the Life line.  -->

In all hands where good, long Life lines are seen, feel sure that the natural vigor will last a long time

in all hands where a short line is seen, there is a danger point indicated for that subject at the termination of the short line. 
- This cannot with safety be ignored by him. 

The character of the line is most important, for from it you read the muscular strength, robustness, and vigor of your subject. 

If the line be deep and well cut, the Current is coursing in a good supply through a deep channel, and your subject is strong, vigorous, full of vitality, will resist disease, and have few illnesses. 

These strong lines are found most often on phlegmatic persons, for these subjects live on muscular strength, not nervous energy. 

So the deepest lines are in the hands having the least sensitive nerves, and consequently the fewest lines. 

The lives of these subjects are more even, for they worry little and are not burdened with delicacy and poor health. They are capable of great exertion physically. In connection with consistency of the hands the deep-cut Life line is important to note. If the line be shallow and broad or chained, the subject, even with elastic consistency, will not possess the energy of one with a deep line. The subject with a deep Life line has more ability to throw off worry and remain calm in moments of excitement. 

He is endowed with vigor of constitution, is filled with self-confidence, and inspires it in others. He is intense in everything he does, work and play alike. If a Life line be deep and long it will show that the vitality and robustness continues during the entire life, but most Life lines become thin at the lower end, when the vitality naturally wanes. Vigor, strength, health, ardor, self-confidence, intensity, and energy sum up the attributes of the deep-cut Life line, and this line will affect all of the types. 

The strength and vigor will increase the Jupiterian propensities to "eat, drink, and be merry," and from this Life line and the Jupiterian type we get many drunkards. This is one of the distinguishing combinations which tells of danger in this direction. If the third phalanx of Jupiter be very full and the color of hand and line red, your subject is likely one who has already indulged heavily. He has, however, only the illnesses which are produced by excess, as his strong Life line shows, and he can indulge in a good deal of dissipation before it begins to impair his vitality. This subject lives a life free from disease and generally drops with apoplexy. The same danger is present with a strong Martian type, especially with red color and red hair. The deep Life line makes the Apollonian a strong, healthy fellow, one to make his way through the world with ease. The Venusian is intensely passionate, and so strong in health and vitality that the exercise of natural Venusian passions is much increased. 

In all cases it is the addition of good health and great vitality to the type, and with this idea in mind you can reason out the various combinations. A narrow and thin line indicates less vitality, less robustness, less resistance to illness, and greater liability of the subject to be overcome by various troubles of health. The thin line does not mean that the subject is necessarily delicate or sickly, but it shows that he cannot endure as much hardship, exposure, or resist disease as well as a subject with a deep Life line. In all character of Life lines observe the proportion to the other lines. If the Life line be deep and all other lines thin or nervous, the subject will go through life with less worry and fewer nervous spells. If the Life line be thin and all other lines deep and well cut, the subject will be continually overstrained and health will surely suffer, for the thin Life line is not of sufficient size to carry the amount of Current which is flowing through the hand. The result of such a combination will be that the health will give way at some point in the line. The thin Life line is not distinctly a nervous line, yet the subject with such a line will be more nervous than one with a deep line. He will be apprehensive of coming evils, he seems instinctively to feel that the tension on health is great, and he fears the day when it will be overstrained. In choosing persons to go through great privations, such as explorers and prospectors, select those with deep and well-cut Life lines, not subjects with thin lines.
