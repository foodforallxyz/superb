THE NEW PORTS OF CUSTOMS.-PIT-COAL IN CEBÚ.-Yloilo.-INDUCEMENTS TO THE

CULTIVATION OF SUGAR.

In 1830, 7 new ports were opened as an experiment. But due to great frauds in the tolls, they were soon closed again. 

This was followed by a custom-house for foreing trade in:

- Zamboanga in 1831
- Sual in the Gulf of Lingayen, one of the safest harbours on the west coast of Luzon in 1855
- Iloílo in Panay in 1855
- Cebú in 1863

Before 1635, the Spaniards had established a fort at Zamboanga, which reduced the piratical excursions&. 

> *In anticipation of an attack by Koxinga, all the available forces, including those of Zamboanga, were collected around Manila. The Moro attacked the island with 60 ships, whereas formerly their armaments used not to exceed six or eight ships. Torrubia, p. 363.



Until 1848, 800-1,500 people have been carried off by the Moro.† 
† Hakl. Morga, Append. 360.

The Zamboanga custom-house was therefore based on political rather than commercial motives, for easy access to the piratical states of the Sulu Sea for selling their products. 

Trade, up to the present date, is but of very inconsiderable amount, the exports consisting chiefly of a little coffee (in 1871 nearly 6,000 picos), which, from bad management, is worth 30% less than Manila coffee, and of the collected products of the forest and of the water, such as wax, birds'-nests, tortoise-shell, pearls, mother-of-pearl, and edible holothuria. This trade, as well as that with Solo, is entirely in the hands of the Chinese, who alone possess the patience, adaptiveness, and adroitness which are required for the purpose.

Suál is specially important for its rice exports.  Its foreign trade is therefore affected by the results of the harvests in Saigon, Birmah, and China. 

In 1868, when the harvests in those countries turned out good, Suál carried on only a coasting trade.

Cebú has a population of 34,000. It is the chief town of Cebu island and the seat of Government and of the bishop of the Bisayans. It is within 48 hours from Manila by steamer. 

It is as favourably situated with regard to the eastern portion of the Bisayan group as Yloílo is for the western, and is acquiring increased importance as the emporium for its products. Sugar and tobacco are obtained from Bojól; rice from Panáy; aback from Leyté and Mindanao; and coffee, wax, Spanish cane, and mother-of-pearl from Misamis (Mindanáo). Its distance from Sámar is twenty-six, from Leyté two and a half, from Bojól four, and from Negrós eighteen miles.

Cebú island  extends over 75 square miles. A lofty mountain range traverses it from north to south, dividing the east from the west side, and its population is estimated at 340,000,–4,533 to the square mile. The inhabitants are peaceable and docile; thefts occur very seldom, and robberies never. Their occupations are agriculture, fishing, and weaving for home consumption. Cebú produces sugar, tobacco, maize, rice, &c., and in the mountains potatoes ; but the rice produced does not suffice for their requirements, there being only a little level land, and the deficiency is imported from Panáy.

The island possesses considerable beds of coal, the full yield of which may now be looked for, as the duty on export was abandoned by a decree of the 5th May, 1869.* While in Luzon and Panáy the land is for the most part the property of the peasantry, in Cebú it mostly belongs to the mestizes, and is let out by them, in very small allotments, upon lease. The owners of the soil know how to keep the peasants in a state of dependence by usurious loans; and one of the results of this abuse is that agriculture in this island stands lower than in almost any other part of the archipelago.f The entire value of the exports in 1868 amounted to 1,181,050 dollars; of which sugar to the value of 481,127 dollars, and abacá to the value of 378,256 dollars, went to England, abacá amounting to 112,000 to America, and tobacco to 118,260 dollars to Spain. The imports of foreign goods, mostly by the Chinese, come through Manila, where they - purchase from the foreign import houses. The value of these imports amounted in 1868 to 182,522 dollars; of which 150,000 dollars were for English cotton stuffs. The entire imports of the island were estimated at 1,243,582 dollars, and the exports at 226,989 dollars. Among the importations were twenty chests of images, a sign of the deeply-rooted worship of the Virgin. For

* According to the Mineral Review, Madrid, 1866, xvii. 244, the coal from the mountain of Alpacó, in the district of Nága, in Cebú, is dry, pure, almost free of sulphur pyrites, burns easily, and with a strong flame. In the experiments made at the laboratory of the School of Mines in Madrid it yielded four per cent. of ashes, and a heating power of 4,825 caloria ; i.e., by the burning of one part by weight 4,825 parts by weight of water were heated to 1° C. Good pit-coal gives 6,000 cal. The first coal pits in Cebú were excavated in the Massánga valley; but the works were discontinued in 1859, after considerable ontlay had been made on them. Four strata of considerable thickness were subsequently discovered in the valley of Alpacó and in the mountain of Oling, in Naga. ..... "The coal of Cebú is acknowledged to be better than that of Australia and Labuan, but has not sufficient heating power to be used, unmixed with other coal, on long sea voyages."

According to the Catalogue of the Products of the Philippines (Manila, 1866), the coal strata of Cebú have, at many places in the mountain range which runs from north to south across the whole of the island, an average thickness of two miles. The coul is of middling quality, and is burnt in the Government steam works after being mixed with Cardiff coal. The price in Cebú is on the average six dollars per ton.

THE PORT OF Yloilo.


merly the products for exportation were bought up by the foreign merchants, mostly through Chinese mestizes ; but now they are bought direct from the producers, who thus obtain better prices in consequence of the abolition of the high brokerages. To this and to the energy of the foreign merchants, under favourable circumstances, is the gradual improvement of agriculture principally to be ascribed.

Yloílo is the most important of the newly opened ports, being the central point of the Bisayan group, and situated in one of the most thickly populated and industrious provinces. N. Loney estimates the export of goods woven from the fibre of the pine, from Yloílo and the neighbouring provinces, at about one million dollars annually.

The harbour is excellent, being completely protected by an island which lies immediately before it; and at high tide there is about twelve feet of water close in shore for vessels to lie in. On account of the bar, however, ships of a deeper draught than this are obliged to complete their loading outside.

Previous to the opening of the new harbours, all the provinces were compelled as well to bring their products intended for exportation to Manila, as to receive from the same place their foreign imports; the cost of which therefore was greatly increased through the extra expenses incurred by the double voyage, reloading, brokerage, and wharfage charges. According to a written account of N. Loney, it is shown how profitable, even after a few years, the opening of Yloílo has been to the provinces immediately adjoining—the islands of Panáy and Negrós.

The higher prices which can be obtained for directly exported sugar, combined with the facility and security of the trade as contrasted with the late monopoly enjoyed by Manila, have occasioned a great extension of the cultivation of that article. Not only in Yloílo, but also in Antique and Negrós, many new plantations have arisen, and the old ones have been enlarged as much as possible; and not less important has been the progress in the manufacture.

In 1857 there was not one iron mill to be found on the island; so that, in working with the wooden mill, about thirty per cent. of the sap remained in the cane, even after it had thrice passed through. The old wooden presses, which were worked by steam or buffaloes, have now been supplanted by new ones; and these the native planters have no difficulty in obtaining, as they can get them on credit from the warehouses of the English importers. Instead of the old Chinese cast-iron pans which were in use, far superior articles have been imported from Europe; and many large factories worked by steam-power and with all modern improvements have been established. In agriculture, likewise, creditable progress is noticeable. Improved ploughs, carts, and farming implements generally, are to be had in plenty.

These changes naturally show how important it was to establish at different points, extending over two hundred miles of the Archipelago, commercial centres, where it was desirable that foreigners should settle. Without these latter, and the facilities afforded to credit which thereby ensued, the sudden rise and prosperity of Yloilo would not have been possible, inasmuch as the mercantile houses in that capital would have been debarred from trading with unknown planters in distant provinces, otherwise than for ready money.

A large number of half-castes, too, who before traded in manufactured goods purchased in Manila, were enabled after this to send their goods direct to the provinces, to the foreign firms settled there; and as, ultimately, neither these latter nor the Chinese retail dealers could successfully compete with them, the result has been that, as much to their own profit as to that of the country, they have betaken themselves to the cultivation of sugar.

RESULTS OF FREE TRADE

In this manner important plantations have been established in Negrós, which are managed by natives of Yloílo : but there is a scarcity of labourers on the island.

Foreigners now can legally acquire property, and possess a marketable title ; in which respect the law, until a very recent period, was of an extremely uncertain nature..

Land is to be obtained by purchase, or, when not already taken up, by “denuncia” (i.e. priority of claim). In such case, the would-be possessor of the land must enter into an undertaking in the nearest of the native Courts to cultivate and keep the said land in a fit and serviceable condition. Should no other claim be put in, notice is thereupon given of the grant, and the magistrate or alcalde concludes the compact without other cost than the usual stamp duty. Many half-castes and natives, not having the necessary capital to carry on a large plantation successfully, sell the fields which they have already partially cultivated to European capitalists, who are thus relieved of all the preliminary tedious work. Evidently the Colonial Government is now sincerely disposed to favour the laying out of large plantations. The want of good roads is particularly felt : but, with the increase of agriculture, this defect will naturally be remedied ; and, moreover, most of the sugar factories are situated on rivers which are unnavigable even by flat freight boats.

The value of land in many parts of the country has doubled within the last ten years. *

Up to 1850 the pico of sugar was worth in Yloílo from 1 dol. 5 c. to 1 dol. 25 c., and seldom over 2 dols. in Manila; in 1866, 3 dols. 25 c.; and in 1868, 4 dols. 75 c. to 5 dols. in Yloilo.

* In Jaró the rents have increased threefold in six years : and cattle which were worth 10 dols. in 1860, fetched 25 dols. in 1866. Plots of land on the “ Ria," in Yloilo, have risen from 100 dols. to 500 dols., and even as high as 800 dols. (Diario, February, 1867). These results are to be ascribed to the sugar trade, which, through free exportation, has become extremely lucrative.

The business in Yloilo therefore shows an increase of 1 dol. 75 per pico. *

At the end of 1866 there were as many as twenty Europeans established on the island of Negrós as sugar planters, besides a number of half-castes. Most of them were working with steam machinery and vacuum pans. The general rate of pay is from 2 dols. 5 c. to 3 dols. per month. On some plantations the principle of “acsa," i.e. part share, is in operation. The owner lets out a piece of ground, providing draught cattle and all necessary ploughing implements, to a native, who works it, and supplies the mill with the cut cane, receiving as payment a share, generally a third, of the product.

In Negrós the violet cane is cultivated, and in Manila the white (Otaheiti). The land does not require manuring. On new ground, or what we may term virgin soil, the cane often grows to a height of thirteen feet. A vast improvement is to be observed in the mode of dress of the people. Piña and silk stuffs are becoming quite common. Advance in luxury is always a favourable sign; according to the increase of requirements, industry flourishes in proportion.

As I have already mentioned, California, Japan, China, and Australia appear designed by nature to be the principal consumers of the products of the Philippine Islands. Certainly at present England is the best customer; but nearly half the account is for sugar, in consequence of their own custom duties.

Sometimes it happens that not more than one-fourth of the sugar crop is sufficiently refined to compete in the Australian and Californian markets with the sorts from Bengal, Java, and the Mauritius; the remaining three-fourths, if particularly white, must perforce undertake the long voyage to England, despite the

* In 1855 Yloilo took altogether from Negros 3,000 picos out of 11,700; in 1860 as much as 90,000 picos; in 1863, 176,000 picos (in twenty-seven foreign ships); in 1866, 260,000 picos ; in 1871, 312,379 picos from both islands.

high freight and certain loss on the voyage of from ten to twelve per cent. through the leakage of the molasses.

The inferior quality of the Philippine sugar is at once perceived by the English refiners, and is only taxed at 8s. per cwt., while purer sorts pay 10s. to 128.* In this manner the English customs favour the inferior qualities of manufactured sugar.

The colonial Government did not allow those engaged in the manufacture of sugar to distil rum from the molasses until the year 1862. They had, therefore, little inducement to extract, at a certain expense, a substance the value of which they were not permitted to realise : but under ordinary circumstances the distillation of the rum not only covered the cost of refining, but gave, in addition, a fair margin of profit.

• The sugar intended for the English market cost in Manila, in the years 1868 and 1869, from $15 to £16 per ton, and fetched in London about £20 per ton. The best refined sugar prepared in Manila for Australia was, on account of the higher duty, worth only £3 per ton more in London ; but, being £5 dearer than the inferior quality, it commanded a premium of £2. Manila exports the sugar chiefly from Pangasinan, Pampanga, and Laguna.-(From private information.)
