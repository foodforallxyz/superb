THE CHINESE.

I have still to speak of an important portion of the population, viz. the Chinese, who are destined to play a remarkable part, inasmuch as the development of the land-cultivation demanded by the increasing trade and commercial intercourse can be effected only by Chinese industry and perseverance.

Manila has always been a favourite place for Chinese immigrants; and neither the hostility of the people, nor oppressing and prohibitory decrees for a long time on the part of the Government, not even the repeated massacres, have been able to prevent their coming. The position of the islands, south-east of two of the most important of the Chinese provinces, must necessarily have brought about a trade between the two countries very early, as ships can make the voyage in either direction with a moderate wind, as well in the south-west as the north-east monsoon. 

In a few old writers may even be found the assertion that the Philippine Islands were at one time subject to the dominion of China ; and Father Gaubil (“Lettres Édifiantes') mentions that Joung-lo (of the Ming dynasty) maintained a fleet consisting of 30,000 men, which at different times proceeded to Manila. The presence of this fileet as early as the arrival of Magellan in the extreme east of the archipelago, as well as the China plates and earthenware vessels discovered in the excavations, plainly show that the trade with China had extended far earlier to the most distant islands of the archipelago. It formed the chief sup

port of the young Spanish colony, and, after the rise of the Encomiendas, was nearly the only source of its prosperity. It was feared that the junks would offer their cargoes to the Dutch if any obstacle was put in the way of their coming to Manila. The colony certainly could not maintain its position without the “Sangleyes,"'* who came annually in great numbers in the junks from China, and spread all over the country and in the towns as shopkeepers, artisans, gardeners, and fishermen ; besides which, they were the only skilful and industrious workers, as the Indians under the priestly domination had forgotten altogether many trades which they had engaged in in former times. I take these facts from Morga.

In spite of all this, the Spaniards have, from the very commencement, endeavoured rigorously to limit the number of the Chinese ; who were then, as they are now, envied and hated by the Indians for their industry, frugality, and cunning, by which means they soon became rich. They were an abomination, moreover, in the eyes of the priests as being irreclaimable heathens, whose example prevented the natives from making progress in the direction of Christianity; and the Government feared them on account of the strong bond of union existing between them, and as being subjects of so powerful a nation, whose close proximity threatened the small body of Spaniards with destruction. † Fortunately for the latter, the Ming dynasty, which at that time was hastening to its downfall, did not think of conquest; but wickedly disposed powers which sprang into

* The Chinese were generally known in the Philippines as “Sangleyes;" according to Professor Schott, “sang-lui (in the south szang-loi, also senng-loi) mercatorum ordo." "Sang" is more especially applied to the travelling traders, in opposition to “kú," tabernarii.

t...“They are a wicked and vicious people, and, owing to their numbers, and to their being such large eaters, they consume the provisions and render them dear ... It is true the town cannot exist without the Chinese, as they are the workers in all the trades and business, and very industrious, and work for small wages ; but for that very reason a lesser number of them would be sufficient."--MORGA, p. 349.

MASSACRE OF CHINESE

existence upon their downfall brought the colony into extreme danger.

In the attack of the pirate Limahong in 1574, they escaped destruction only by a miracle. Soon, new dangers threatened them.  

In 1603, a few mandarins came to Manila, under the pretence of ascertaining whether the ground about Cavite really contained gold. They were supposed to be spies, and it was concluded, from their peculiar mission, that an attack upon the colony was intended by the Chinese.

The archbishop and the priests incited the distrust which was felt against the numerous Chinese who were settled in Manila. Mutual hate and suspicion arose. Both parties feared one another and prepared for hostilities. 

The Chinese commenced the attack. But the united forces of the Spaniards being supported by the Japanese and the Indians, 23,000, according to other reports 25,000, of the Chinese were either killed or driven into the desert. 

When the news of this massacre reached China, a letter from the Royal Commissioners was sent to the Governor of Manila. That noteworthy document shows in so striking a manner how hollow the great Government was at that time that I have given a literal translation of it at the end of this chapter. After the extermination of the Chinese, food and all other necessaries of life were difficult to obtain on account of the utter incapacity of the Indians for work ; but by 1605 the number of Chinese * had again so increased that a decree was issued limiting them to 6,000, " these to be employed in the cultivation of the country;" while at the same time their rapid increase was taken advantage of by the Captain-General for his own interest, as he exacted eight dollars from each Chinaman for permission to remain. In 1639 the Chinese population had risen to 30,000, according to other information 40,000 ; when they revolted and were reduced to 7,000. “The natives, who generally were so

* " Recopilacion," Lib. iv., Tit. xviii., ley. 1.


listless and indifferent, showed the utmost eagerness in assisting in the massacre of the Chinese, but more from hatred of this industrious people than from any feeling of friendship towards the Spaniards.*

The void occasioned by this massacre was soon filled up again by Chinese immigrants; and in 1662 the colony was once more menaced with a new and great danger, by the Chinese pirate Kog-seng, who had under his command between 80,000 and 100,000 men, and who already had dispossessed the Dutch of the Island of Formosa. He demanded the absolute submission of the Philippines ; his sudden death, however, saved the colony, and occasioned a fresh outbreak of fury against the Chinese settlers in Manilla, a great number of whom were butchered in their own “quarter” (ghetto). † Some dispersed and hid themselves; a few in their terror plunged into the water or hanged themselves ; and a great number fled in small boats to Formosa. I

In 1709 the jealousy against the Chinese once more had reached such a height that they were accused of rebellion, and particularly of monopolising the trades; and, with the exception of the most serviceable of the artisans and such of them as were employed by the Government, they were once again expelled. Spanish writers praise the salutariness of these measures ; alleging that “under the pretence of agriculture the Chinese carry on trade; they are cunning and careful, making money and sending it to China, so that they defraud the Philippines annually of an enormous amount.” Sonnerat, however, complains that art, trade, and commerce, had not recovered from these severe blows; though, he adds, fortunately the Chinese, in spite of prohibitory decrees, are returning through the corrupt connivance of the governor and officials. To the present day they are blamed as being monoSPANISH JEALOUSY.

polists, particularly by the creoles ; and certainly, by means of their steady industry and natural commercial aptitude, they have appropriated nearly all the retail trade to themselves. The sale of European imported goods is entirely in their hands; and the wholesale purchase of the produce of the country for export is divided between the Indians, creoles, and the Chinese, the latter taking about one half. Before this time only the Indians and creoles were permitted to own ships for the purpose of forwarding the produce to Manilla.

In 1757 the jealousy of the Spaniards broke out again in the form of a new order from Madrid, directing the expulsion of the Chinese ; and in 1759 the decrees of banishment, which were repeatedly evaded, were carried into effect : but, as the private interests of the officials did not happen to coincide with those of the creole traders, the consequence was “that the Chinese soon streamed back again in incredible numbers,” and made common cause with the English upon their invasion in 1762.* Thereupon, Señor Anda commanded “that all the Chinese in the Philippine Islands should be hanged,” which order was very generally carried out. †

The last great Chinese massacre took place in 1819, when the aliens were suspected of having brought about the cholera by poisoning the wells. The greater part of the Europeans in Manilla also fell victims to the fury of the populace, but the Spaniards generally were spared.

The prejudice of the Spaniards, especially of the creoles, had always been directed against the Chinese tradesmen, who interfered unpleasantly with the profits of the natives; and against this class in particular were the laws of limitation aimed. The Chinese would willingly have given their attention to farming, were it not that the enmity of the Indians generally prevented them. A decree, issued in 1804, commanded all Chinese shop* See following chapter.

+ Zuñiga, xvi.

keepers to leave Manilla within eight days, only those who were married being allowed to keep shops ; and their residence in the provinces was permitted only upon the condition that they confined themselves entirely to agriculture. Magistrates who allowed them to leave the district over which they commanded were fined 200 dollars; the deputy-governor 25 dollars; and the wretched Chinese were punished with from two to three years' confinement in irons. In 1839 the penalties against the Chinese were somewhat mitigated, but those against the magistrates were still maintained on account of their venality.

In 1843 Chinese ships were placed upon terms of equality with those of other foreign countries (Leg. Ult., II., 476).

In 1850 Captain-General Urbiztondo endeavoured to introduce Chinese colonial farming, and with this object promised a reduction of the taxes to all agricultural immigrants. Many Chinese availed themselves of this opportunity in order to escape the heavy poll-tax; but in general they soon betook themselves to trading once more.

Of late years the Chinese have not suffered from the terrible massacres which used formerly to overtake them ; neither have they suffered banishment; the officials being content to suppress their activity by means of heavy and oppressive taxes. For instance, at the end of 1867 the Chinese shopkeepers were annually taxed 60 dollars for permission to send their goods to the weekly market; this was in addition to a tax of from 12 to 100 dollars on their occupations; and at the same time they were commanded thenceforth to keep their books in Spanish (English Consular Report, 1869).

The Chinese remain true to their customs and mode of living in the Philippines, as they do everywhere else. When they outwardly embrace Christianity, it is done merely to facilitate marriage, or from some motive conducive to their worldly advantage; and occasionally they renounce it, together with their wives

CHINESE EMIGRATION.

in Manilla, when about to return home to China. Very many of them, however, beget families, are excellent householders, and their children in time form the most enterprising, industrious, and wealthy portion of the resident population.

Invigorated by the severe struggle for existence which they have experienced in their own over-populated country, the Chinese appear to preserve their capacity for labour perfectly unimpaired by any climate. No nation can equal them in contentedness, industry, perseverance, cunning, skill, and adroitness in trades and mercantile matters. When once they gain a footing, they generally appropriate the best part of the trade to themselves. In all parts of external India they have dislodged from every field of employment not only their native but, progressively, even their European competitors. Not less qualified and successful are they in the pursuit of agriculture than in trade. The emigration from the too thickly peopled empire of China has scarcely begun. As yet it is but a small stream, but it will by-and-by pour over all the tropical countries of the East in one mighty torrent, completely destroying all such minor obstacles as jealous interference and impotent precaution might interpose.

Over every section of remote India, in the South Sea, in the Indian Archipelago, in the Southern States of America, the Chinese seem destined in time either to supplant every other element, or to found a mixed race upon which to stamp their individuality. In the Western States of the Union their number is rapidly on the increase; and the factories in California are worked entirely by them, achieving results that cannot be accomplished by European labour.

One of the most interesting of the many questions of large comprehensiveness which connect themselves with the penetration of the Mongolian race into America, which up till now it had been the fashion to regard as the inheritance of the Caucasians, is the relative capacity of labour possessed by both these two great races, who in the Western States of America have for the first time measured their mutual strength in friendly rivalry. Both are there represented in their most energetic individuality;* and every nerve will be strained in carrying on the struggle, inasmuch as no other country pays for labour at so high a rate.

The conditions, however, are not quite equal, as the law places certain obstacles in the way of the Chinese. The courts do not protect them sufficiently from insult, which at times is aggravated into malicious manslaughter through the ill-usage of the mob, who hate them bitterly as being reserved, uncompanionable workers. Nevertheless, the Chinese immigrants take their stand firmly. The western division of the Pacific Railway has been chiefly built by the Chinese, who, according to the testimony of the engineers, surpass workmen of all other nationalities in diligence, sobriety, and good conduct. What they lack in physical power they make up for in perseverance and working intelli

* No single people in Europe can in any way compare with the inhabitants of California, which, in the early years of its existence, was composed only of men in the prime of their strength and activity, without aged people, without women, and without children. Their activity, in a country where everything had to be provided (no civilised neighbours living within some hundred miles or so), and where all provisions were to be obtained only at a fabulous cost, was stimulated to the highest pitch. Without here going into the particulars of their history, it need only be remembered that they founded, in twenty-five years, a powerful State, the fame of which has spread all over the world, and around whose borders young territories have sprung into existence and flourished vigorously; two of them indeed having attained to the condition of independent States. After the Californian gold-diggers had changed the configuration of the ground of entire provinces by having, with Titanic might, deposited masses of earth into the sea until they expanded into hilly districts, so as to obtain therefrom, with the aid of ingenious machinery, the smallest particle of gold which was contained therein, they have astonished the world in their capacity of agriculturalists, whose produce is sent even to the most distant markets, and everywhere takes the first rank without dispute. a Such mighty results have been achieved by a people whose total number scarcely, indeed, exceeds 500,000; and therefore, perhaps, they may not find it an easy matter to withstand the competition of the Chinese.

gently together. The unique and nearly incredible performance that took place on the 28th April, 1869, when ten miles of railway track were laid in eleven working hours along a division of

plished by Chinese workmen ; and indeed only by them could it have been practicable.*

Of course, the superiority of the European in respect of the highest intellectual faculties is not for a moment to be doubted ; but, in all branches of commercial life in which cleverness and persevering industry are necessary to success, the Chinese certainly appear entitled to the award. To us it appears that the influx of Chinese must certainly sooner or later kindle a struggle between capital and labour, in order to set a limit upon demands perceptibly growing beyond moderation.

The increasing Chinese immigration already intrudes upon the attention of American statesmen questions of the utmost social and political importance. What influence will this entirely new and strange element exercise over the conformation of American relations ? Will the Chinese found a State in the States, or go into the Union on terms of political equality with the other citizens, and form a new race by alliance with the Caucasian element ? These problems, which can only be touched upon here in a transitory form, have been dealt with in a masterly manner by “Pumpelly," in his work “ Across America and Asia,” published in London in 1870.

• The rails, if laid in one continuous line, would measure about 103,000 feet, the weight of them being 20,000 cwt. Eight Chinamen were engaged in the work, relieving one another by fours. These men were chosen to perform this feat on account of their particular activity, out of 10,000.

(This statement is incorrect, so far as the fact of the feat being accomplished by the Chinese 18 concerned.

Eight Europeans were engaged in this extraordinary piece of work. During the rejoicings which took place in Sacramento upon the opening of the line, these men were paraded in a van, with the account of their splendid achievement painted in large letters on the outside. Certainly not one of them was a Chinaman.-TRANSLATOR's note.)

LETTER OF THE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF CHINCHEO TO DON

PEDRO DE ACUÑA, GOVERNOR OF THE PHILIPPINES.

“ To the powerful Captain-General of Luson. “ Having been given to understand that the Chinese who proceeded to the kingdom of Luzon in order to buy and sell had been murdered by the Spaniards, I have investigated the motives for these massacres, and begged the King to exercise justice upon those who had engaged in these abominable offences, with a view to security in the future.

“ In former years, before my arrival here as royal commissioner, a Chinese merchant named Tioneg, together with three mandarins, went with the permission of the King of China from Luzon to Cavite, for the purpose of prospecting for gold and silver; which appears to have been an excuse, for he found neither gold nor silver; I thereupon prayed the King to punish this impostor Tioneg, thereby making patent the strict justice which is exercised in China.

“ It was during the administration of the ex-Viceroy and Eunuchs that Tioneg and his companion, named Yanglion, uttered the untruth already stated ; and subsequently I begged the King to transmit all the papers bearing upon the matter, together with the minutes of Tioneg's accusation; when I myself examined the before-mentioned papers, and knew that everything that the accused Tioneg had said was utterly untrue.

“I wrote to the King and stated that, on account of the untruth which Tioneg had been guilty of, the Castilians entertained the suspicion that he wished to make war upon them, and that they, under this idea, had murdered more than 30,000 Chinese in Luzon. The King, complying with my request, punished the accused Yanglion, though he omitted to put him to death; neither was Tioneg beheaded or confined in a cage. The Chinese people who had settled in Luzon were in no way to blame. I and others discussed this with the King in order to ascertain what his

pleasure was in this matter, as well as in another, namely, the arrival of two English ships on the coast of Chincheo (Fukien)a very dangerous circumstance for China ; and to obtain His Majesty's decision as to both these most serious matters.

“ We also wrote to the King that he should direct the punishment of both these Chinese ; and, in acknowledging our communication, he replied to us, in respect of the English ships which had arrived in China, that in case they had come for the purpose of plundering, they should be immediately commanded to depart thence for Luzon; and, with regard to the Luzon difficulty, that the Castilians should be advised to give no credence to rogues and liars from China ; and both the Chinese who had discovered the harbour to the English should be executed forthwith ; and that in all other matters upon which we had written to him, our will should be his. Upon receipt of this message by us— the Viceroy, the Eunuch, and myself—we hereby send this our message to the Governor of Luzon, that his Excellency may know the greatness of the King of China and of his Kingdom, for he is so powerful that he commands all upon which the sun and moon shine, and also that the Governor of Luzon may learn with what great wisdom this mighty kingdom is governed, and which power no one for many years has attempted to insult, although the Japanese have sought to disturb the tranquillity of Coria, which belongs to the Government of China. They did not succeed, but on the contrary were driven out, and Coria has remained in perfect security and peace, which those in Luzon well know by report.

“ Years ago, after we learnt that so many Chinese perished in Luzon on account of Tioneg's lies, many of us mandarins met together, and resolved to leave it to the consideration of the King to take vengeance for so great a massacre ; and we said as follows:- The country of Luzon is a wretched one, and of very little importance. It was at one time only the abode of devils

and serpents ; and only because (within the last few years) so large a number of Chinese went thither for the purpose of trading with the Castilians has it improved to such an extent; in which improvement the accused Sangleyes materially assisted by hard labour, the walls being raised by them, houses built, and gardens laid out, and other matters accomplished of the greatest use to the Castilians; and now the question is, why has no consideration been paid for these services, and these good offices acknowledged with thanks, without cruelly murdering so many people ? And although we wrote to the King twice or thrice concerning the circumstances, he answered us that he was indignant about the before-mentioned occurrences, and said for three reasons it is not advisable to execute vengeance, nor to war against Luzon. The first is that for a long time till now the Castilians have been friends of the Chinese; the second, that no one can predict whether the Castilians or the Chinese would be victorious; and the third and last reason is, because those whom the Castilians have killed were wicked people, ungrateful to China, their native country, their elders, and their parents, as they have not returned to China now for very many years. These people, said the King, he valued but little for the foregoing reasons; and he commanded the Viceroy, the Eunuch, and myself, to send this letter through those messengers, so that all in Luzon may know that the King of China has a generous heart, great forbearance, and much mercy, in not declaring war against Luzon; and his justice is indeed manifest, as he has already punished the liar Tioneg. Now, as the Spaniards are wise and intelligent, how does it happen that they are not sorry for having massacred so many people, feeling no repentance thereat, and also are not kinder to those of the Chinese who are still left? Then when the Castilians show a feeling of good-will, and the Chinese and Sangleyes who are left after the dispute return, and the indebted money is repaid, and the property which was taken from the Sangleyes restored, then friendship will again LETTER OF THE GOVERNOR OF JAPAN.

exist between this kingdom and that, and every year trading-ships shall come and go; but if not, then the King will allow no trading, but on the contrary will at once command a thousand ships of war to be built, manned with soldiers and relations of the slain, and will, with the assistance of other peoples and kingdoms who pay tribute to China, wage relentless war, without quarter to any one ; and upon its conclusion will present the kingdom of Luzon to those who do homage to China.

“ This letter is written by the Visitadór-General on the 12th of the second month.”

A contemporary letter of the Governor of Japan forms a somewhat notable contrast :

LETTER OF DAIFUSAMA, GOVERNOR OF JAPAN. “ To the Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, in the year 1605. “ I have received two letters from your Excellency, as also all the donations and presents described in the inventory. Amongst them was the wine made from grapes, which I enjoyed very much. In former years your Excellency requested that six ships might come here, and recently four, which request I have always complied with.

“But my great displeasure has been excited by the fact that of the four ships upon whose behalf your Excellency interposed, one from Antonio made the journey without my permission. This was a circumstance of great audacity, and a mark of disrespect to me. Does your Excellency wish to send that ship to Japan without my permission ?

"Independently of this, your Excellency and others have many times discussed with me concerning the antecedents and interests of Japan, and many other matters, your requests respecting which I cannot comply with. This territory is called Xincoco, which means "consecrated to Idols,' which have been honoured with the highest reverence from the days of our ancestor until now,

and whose actions I alone can neither undo nor destroy. Wherefore, it is in no way fitting that your laws should be promulgated and spread over Japan; and if, in consequence of these misunderstandings, your Excellency's friendship with the kingdom of Japan should cease, and with me likewise, it must be so, for I must do that which I think is right, and nothing which is contrary to my own pleasure.

“Finally, I have heard it frequently said, as a reproach, that many Japanese-wicked, corrupt men-go to your kingdom, remaining there many years, and then return to Japan. This complaint excites my anger, and therefore I must request your Excellency henceforth not to allow such persons to return in the ships which trade here. Concerning the remaining matters, I trust your Excellency will hereafter employ your judgment and circumspection in such a manner as to avoid incurring my displeasure for the future.”

CHAPTER XXVII.

EPITOME-CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.

The Philippines were discovered by Magellan on the 16th of March, 1521–St. Lazarus's day.* But it was not until 1564, after many previous efforts had miscarried, that Legaspi, who left New Spain with five ships, took possession of the Archipelago in the name of Philip II. The discoverer had christened the islands after the sanctified Lazarus. This name, however, never grew into general use; the Spaniards persistently calling them the Western Islands—Islas del Poniente; and the Portuguese, Islas del Oriente. Legaspi gave them their present name in honour of Philip II., who, in his turn, conferred upon them the again extinct name of New Castile.t

Legaspi first of all annexed Cebú, and then Panáy; and six years later, in 1571, he first subdued Manilla, which was at that time a village surrounded by palisades, and commenced forthwith the construction of a fortified town. The subjection of the remaining territory was effected so quickly that, upon the death of Legaspi (in August, 1572), all the western parts were in possession of the Spaniards. Numerous wild tribes in the interior, however, the

• Magellan fell on the 27th April, struck by a poisoned arrow, on the small island of Mactan, lying opposite the harbour of Cebú. His lieutenant, Sebastian de Elcano, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and on the 6th September, 1522, brought back one of the five ships with which Magellan set sail from St. Lucar in 1519, and eighteen men, under Pigafetta, to the same harbour, and thus accomplished the first voyage round the world in three years and fourteen days.

† “ According to recent authors they were also named after Villalobos in 1543."MORGA, p. 5.

Mahomedan states of Mindanáos and the Sulu group, for example, have to this day preserved their independence. The character of the people, as well as their political disposition, favoured the occupancy. There was no mighty power, no old dynasty, no influential priestly domination to overcome, no traditions of national pride to suppress. The natives were either heathens, or recently proselytized superficially to Islamism, and lived under numerous petty chiefs, who ruled them despotically, made war upon one another, and were easily subdued. One such community is called Barangay ; and it forms to this day, though in a considerably modified form, the foundation of the constitutional laws. The Spaniards limited the power of the petty chiefs, upheld slavery, and abolished hereditary nobility and dignity, substituting in its place an aristocracy created by themselves for services rendered to the State ; but they carried out all these changes very gradually and cautiously.* The old usages and

* According to Morga (p. 140) there was neither king nor governor, but in each island and province were numerous persons of rank, whose dependants and subjects were divided into quarters (barrios) and families. These petty rulers had to render homage by ineans of tributes from the crops (buiz), also by socage or personal service: but their relations were exempted from such services as were rendered by the plebeians (timauas). The dignities of the chieftains were hereditary, their honours descended also to their wives. If a chief particularly distinguished himself, then the rest followed him ; but the Government retained to themselves the administration of the Barangays through their own particular officials. Concerning the system of slavery under the native rule, Morga says (p. 41, abbreviated),-" The natives of these islands are divided into three classesnobles, timauas or plebeians, and the slaves of the former. There are different sorts of slaves : some in complete slavery (Saguiguilires), who work in the house, as also their children. Others live with their families in their own houses and render service to their lords at sowing and harvest-time, also as boatmen, or in the construction of houses, &c. They must attend as often as they are required, and give their services without pay or recompense of any kind. They are called Namamahayes; and their duties and obligations descend to their children and successors. Of these Saguiguilires and Namamahayes a few are full slaves, some half slaves, and others quarter slaves.

When, for instance, the mother or father was free, the only son would be half free, half slave. Supposing there were several sons, the first one inherits the father's position, the second that of the mother. When the number is unequal the last one is half free and half slave; and the descendants born of such half slaves and those who are free are quarter slaves. The half slaves, whether baguiguilires or namamahayes,

 [blocks in formation]
laws, so long as they did not interfere with the natural course of government, remained untouched and were operative by legal sanction; and even in criminal matters their validity was equal to those emanating from the Spanish courts. To this day the chiefs of Barangay, with the exception of those bearing the title of “don,” have no privileges save exemption from the poll-tax and socage service. They are virtually tax-collectors, excepting that they are not paid for such service, and their private means are made responsible for any deficit. The prudence of such a measure might well be doubted, without regard to the fact that it tempts the chiefs to embezzlement and extortion; and it must alienate a class of natives who would otherwise be a support to the Government.

Since the measures adopted in alleviation of the conquest and occupancy succeeded in so remarkable a manner, the governors and their subordinates of those days, at a time when Spain was powerful and chivalrous, naturally appear to have been distinguished for wisdom and high spirit. Legaspi possessed both qualities in a marked degree. Hardy adventurers were tempted there, as in America, by privileges and inducements which power afforded them; as well as by the hope, which, fortunately for the country, was never realised, of its being rich in auriferous deposits. In Luzon, for instance, Hernando Riquel stated that there were many gold-mines in several places which were seen by the Spaniards; "the ore is so rich that I will not write any more about it, as I might possibly

serve their lords equally every month in turns. Half and quarter slaves can, by reason of their being partially free, compel their lord to give them their freedom at a previously determined and unfluctuating price : but full slaves do not possess this right. A namamahaye is worth half as much as a saguiguilire. All slaves are natives."

Again, at p. 143, he writes :-“A slave who has children by her lord is thereby freed together with her children. The latter, however, are not considered well born, and cannot inherit property; nor do the rights of nobility, supposing in such a case the father to possess any, descend to them."

come under a suspicion of exaggerating; but I swear by Christ that there is more gold on this island than there is iron in all Biscay.” They received no pay from the kingdom; but a formal right was given them to profit by any territory which was brought into subjection by them. Some of these expeditions in search of conquest were enterprises undertaken for private gain, others for the benefit of the governor; and such service was rewarded by him with grants of lands, carrying an annuity, offices, and other benefits (encomiendas, ofícios y aprovechamiéntos). The grants were at first made for three generations in New Spain for four), but were very soon limited to two; when Di los Rios pointed this out as being a measure very prejudicial to the Crown, “since they were little prepared to serve his Majesty, as their grand-children had fallen into the most extreme poverty.” After the death of the feoffee the grant reverted to the State ; and the governor thereupon disposed of it anew.

The whole country at the outset was completely divided into these livings, the defraying of which formed by far the largest portion of the expenses of the kingdom. Investitures of a similar nature existed, more or less, in a territory of considerable extent, the inhabitants of which had to pay tribute to the feoffee; and this tribute had to be raised out of agricultural produce, the value of which was fixed by the feudal lord at a very low rate, but sold by him to the Chinese at a considerable profit. The feudal lords, moreover, were not satisfied with these receipts, but held the natives in a state of slavery, until forbidden by a Bull of Pope Gregory XIV. dated 18th April, 1591. Caffre and negro slaves, whom the Portuguese imported by way of India, were, however, still permitted.

The original holders of feudal tenures amassed considerable booty therefrom. Zuñiga relates that as early as the time of Labezares, who was provisional governor between 1572 and 1575, he visited the Bisayas and checked the covetousness of the encoJUAN DE SALCÉDO.

menderos, so that at least during his rule they relaxed their system of extortion. Towards the end of Lasande's government (1575-80) a furious quarrel broke out between the priests and the encomendéros; the first preached against the oppression of the latter, and memorialised Philip II. thereon. The king commanded that the Indians should be protected, as the extortionate greed of the feudal chiefs had exceeded all bounds; and the natives were then at liberty to pay their tribute either in money or in kind. The result of this well-intentioned regulation appears to have produced a greater assiduity both in agriculture and trade, “ as the natives preferred to work without coercion, not on account of extreme want.” And here I may briefly refer to the achievements of Juan de Salcédo, the most illustrious of all the conquerors. Supported by his grandfather, Legaspi, with forty-five Spanish soldiers, he fitted out an expedition at his own expense, embarked at Manilla in May, 1572, examined all parts of the west coast of the island, landed in all the bays which were accessible to his light-draught ships, and was well received by the natives at most of the places. He generally found great opposition in penetrating into the interior; yet he succeeded in subduing many of the inland tribes; and when he reached Cape Bogeadór, the north-west point of Luzon, the extensive territory which at present forms the provinces of Zambáles, Pangasinan, and North and South Ylócos, acknowledged the Spanish rule. The exhaustion of his soldiers obliged Salcédo to return. In Bígan, the present capital of South Ylócos, he constructed a fort, and left therein for its protection his lieutenant and twenty-five men, while he himself returned, accompanied only by seventeen soldiers, in three small vessels. In this manner he reached the Cagayán River, and proceeded up it until forced by the great number of hostile natives to retreat to the sea. Pursuing the voyage to the east coast, he came down in course of time to Paracáli; where he embarked in a boat for Manilla, was capsized, and rescued from drowning by some passing Indians.

In the meantime Legaspi had died, and Labezares was provisionally carrying on the government. Salcédo heard of this with vexation at being passed over ; but, when he recovered from his jealousy, he was entrusted with the subjugation of Camarines, which he accomplished in a short time. In 1574 he returned to Ylócos, in order to distribute annuities among his soldiers, and to receive his own share. While still employed upon the building of Bígan, he discovered the fleet of the notorious Chinese pirate, Limahón, who, bent upon taking possession of the colony, was then passing that part of the coast with sixty-two ships and a large number of soldiers. He hastened at once, with all the help which he could summon together in the neighbourhood, to Manilla, where he was nominated to the command of the troops, in the place of the already deposed master of the forces ; and he drove the Chinese from the town, which they had destroyed. They then withdrew to Pangasinan, and Salcédo burnt their fleet; which exploit was achieved with very great difficulty. In 1576 this Cortes of the Philippines died.

Apart from the priests, the first-comers consisted only of officials, soldiers and sailors; and to them, naturally, fell all the high profits of the China trade. Manilla was their chief market, and it also attracted a great portion of the external Indian trade, which the Portuguese had frightened away from Malacca by their excessive cruelty. The Portuguese, it is true, still remained in Macao and the Moluccas : but they wanted those remittances which were almost exclusively sought after by the Chinese, viz., the silver which Manilla received from New Spain. In 1580 Portugal, together with all its colonies, was handed over to the Spanish Crown; and the period extending from this event to the decay of Portugal (1580-1640) witnessed the Philippines at the height of their power and prosperity.

CHANGES OF THE GOVERNMENT.

363

The Governor of Manilla ruled over a part of Mindanao, Sulu, the Moluccas, Formosa, and the original Portuguese possessions in Malacca and India. “All that lies between Cape Singapore and Japan is subject to Luzon; their ships cross the ocean to China and New Spain, and drive so magnificent a trade that, if it were only free, it would be the most extraordinary that the world could show. It is incredible what glory these islands confer upon Spain. The Governor of the Philippines treats with the Kings of Cambodia, Japan, China. The first is his ally, the last his friend ; and the same with Japan. He declares war or peace, without waiting for the command from distant Spain.”* But the Dutch had now begun the struggle, which they managed to carry on against Philip II. in every corner of the world; and even in 1610 Di los Rios complained that he found the country very much altered through the progress and advance made by the Dutch ; also that the Moros of Mindanao and Sulu, feeling that they were supported by Holland, were continually in a state of discontent.

The downfall of Portugal occasioned the loss of her colonies once more. Spanish policy, the government of the priests, and the jealousy of the Spanish merchants and traders especially, did everything that remained to be done to prevent the development of agriculture and commerce-perhaps, on the whole, fortunately for the natives.

The subsequent history of the Philippines is, in all its particulars, quite as unsatisfactory and uninteresting as that of all the other Spanish-American possessions. Ineffectual expeditions against pirates, and continual disputes between the clerical and secular authorities, form the principal incidents.t

+ Chamisso (“Observations and Views," p. 72), thanks to the translator of Zuñiga, knew that he was in duty bound to dwell at some length over this excellent history; though Zuniga's narrative is always, comparatively speaking, short and to the point. The judiciously abbreviated English translation, however, contains many miscomprehensions.

After the first excitement of religious belief and military renown had subsided, the minds of those who went later to these outlying possessions, consisting generally as they did of the very dregs of the nation, were seized with an intense feeling of selfishness ; and frauds and peculations were the natural sequence. The Spanish writers are full of descriptions of the wretched state of society then existing, which it is unnecessary to repeat here.

The colony had scarcely been molested by external enemies, with the exception of pirates. In the earliest time the Dutch had engaged occasionally in attacks on the Bisayas. But in 1762 (during the war of the Bourbon succession) an English fleet suddenly appeared before Manilla, and took the surprised town without any difficulty. The Chinese allied themselves with the English. A great insurrection broke out among the Indians, and the colony, under the provisional government of a feeble archbishop, was for a time in great danger. It was reserved for a dignitary of the Church, Anda, an energetic patriot, to inflame the Indians against the foreigners; and the opposition incited by the zealousness of the priests grew to such an extent that the English, who were confined in the town, were actually glad to be able to retreat. In the following year the news arrived in Europe of the conclusion of peace; but in the interval this insurrection, brought about by the invasion, had rapidly and considerably extended; and it was not suppressed until 1765, when the work was accomplished by creating enmity among the different tribes. But this was not done without a loss to the province of Ylócos of 269,270 persons-half of the population, as represented by Zuñiga.

Severity and want of tact on the part of the Government and their instruments, as well as bigoted dissensions, have caused many revolts of the natives; yet none, it is true, of any great danger to the Spanish rule. The discontent has always been confined to a single district, as the natives do not form a united nation ; neither DISCONTENT OF THE CREOLES.

the bond of a common speech nor a general interest binding the different tribes together. The state communications and laws among them scarcely reach beyond the borders of the villages and their dependencies.

A consideration of far more importance to the distant metropolis than the condition of the constantly excited Indians, who are politically divided among themselves, and really have no steady object in view, is the attitude of the half-castes and creoles, whose discontent increases in proportion to their numbers and prosperity. The military revolt which broke out in 1823, the leaders of which were two creoles, might easily have terminated fatally for Spain. The latest of all the risings of the half-castes seems to have been the most dangerous, not only to the Spanish power, but to all the European population.

On the 20th of January, 1872, between eight and nine in the evening, the artillery, marines, and the garrison of the arsenal revolted in Cavite, the naval harbour of the Philippines, and mur. dered their officers; and a lieutenant who endeavoured to carry the intelligence to Manilla fell into the hands of a crowd of natives. The news therefore did not reach the capital until the next morning, when all the available troops were at once dispatched, and, after a heavy preliminary struggle, they succeeded the following day in storming the citadel. A dreadful slaughter of the rebels ensued. Not a soul escaped. Among them was not a single European ; but there were many half-castes, of whom several were priests and lawyers. Though perhaps the first accounts, written under the influence of terror, may have exaggerated many particulars, yet both official and private letters agree in describing the conspiracy as being long contemplated, widely spread, and well planned. The whole fleet and a large number of troops were absent at the time, engaged in the expedition against Solo. A portion of the garrison of Manilla were to rise at the same time as the revolt in Cavite, and thousands of natives were to precipitate themselves on the caras blancas (pale faces), and murder them. The failure of the conspiracy was, it appears, only attributable to a fortunate accident—to the circumstance, namely, that a body of the rebels mistook some rocket fired upon the occasion of a Church festival for the agreed signal, and commenced the attack too soon.

Let me be permitted, in conclusion, to bring together a few observations which have been scattered through the text, touching the relations of the Philippines with foreign countries, and briefly speculate thereon.

Credit is certainly due to Spain for having bettered the condition of a people who, though comparatively speaking highly civilised, yet being continually distracted by petty wars, had sunk into a disordered and uncultivated state. The inhabitants of these beautiful islands, upon the whole, may well be considered to have lived as comfortably during the last hundred years, protected from all external enemies and governed by mild laws, as those of any other tropical country under native or European sway,– owing, in some measure, to the frequently discussed peculiar circumstances which protect the interests of the natives.

The monks, also, have certainly had an essential part in the production of the results.

Sprung from the lowest orders, inured to hardship and want, and on terms of the closest intimacy with the natives, they were peculiarly fitted to introduce them to a practical conformity with the new religion and code of morality. Later on, also, when they possessed rich livings, and their devout and zealous interest in the welfare of the masses relaxed in proportion as their incomes increased, they materially assisted in bringing about the circumstances already described, with their favourable and unfavourable aspects. Further, possessing neither family nor good education, they were disposed to associate themselves intimately with the natives and their requirements; and their

GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES.

arrogant opposition to the temporal power generally arose through their connection with the natives. With the altered condition of things, however, all this has disappeared. The colony can no longer be kept secluded from the world. Every facility afforded for commercial intercourse is a blow to the old system, and a great step made in the direction of broad and liberal reforms. The more foreign capital and foreign ideas and customs are introduced, increasing the prosperity, enlightenment, and selfesteem of the population, the more impatiently will the existing evils be endured.

England can and does open her possessions unconcernedly to the world. The British colonies are united to the mother country by the bond of mutual advantage, viz. the production of raw material by means of English capital, and the exchange of the same for English manufactures. The wealth of England is so great, the organization of her commerce with the world so complete, that nearly all the foreigners even in the British possessions are for the most part agents for English business houses, which would scarcely be affected, at least to any marked extent, by a political dismemberment. It is entirely different with Spain, which possesses the colony as an inherited property, and without the power of turning it to any useful account.

Government monopolies rigorously maintained, insolent disregard and neglect of the half-castes and powerful creoles, and the example of the United States, were the chief reasons of the downfall of the American possessions. The same causes threaten ruin to the Philippines : but of the monopolies I have said enough.

Half-castes and creoles, it is true, are not, as they formerly were in America, excluded from all official appointments; but they feel deeply hurt and injured through the crowds of place-hunters which the frequent changes of Ministers send to Manilla. The influence, also, of the American element is at least visible on the horizon, and will be more noticeable when the relations increase between the two countries. At present they are very slender. The trade in the meantime follows in its old channels to England and to the Atlantic ports of the United States. Nevertheless, whoever desires to form an opinion upon the future history of the Philippines, must not consider simply their relations to Spain, but must have regard to the prodigious changes which a few decades produce on either side of our planet.

For the first time in the history of the world the mighty powers on both sides of the ocean have commenced to enter upon a direct intercourse with one another-Russia, which alone is larger than any two other parts of the earth ; China, which contains within its own boundaries a third of the population of the world ; and America, with ground under cultivation nearly sufficient to feed treble the total population of the earth. Russia's future rôle in the Pacific Ocean is not to be estimated at present.

The trade between the two other great powers will therefore be presumably all the heavier, as the rectification of the pressing need of human labour on the one side, and of the corresponding overplus on the other, will fall to them.

The world of the ancients was confined to the shores of the Mediterranean; and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans sufficed at one time for our traffic. When first the shores of the Pacific re-echoed with the sounds of active commerce, the trade of the world and the history of the world may be really said to have begun. A start in that direction has been made; whereas not so very long ago the immense ocean was one wide waste of waters. traversed from both points only once a year. From 1603 to 1769 scarcely a ship had ever visited California, that wonderful country which, twenty-five years ago, with the exception of a few places on the coast, was an unknown wilderness, but which is now covered with flourishing and prosperous towns and cities, divided from sea to sea by a railway, and its capital already ranking the

third of the seaports of the Union; even at this early stage of its existence a central point of the world's commerce, and apparently destined, by the proposed junction of the great oceans, to play a most important part in the future.

In proportion as the navigation of the west coast of America extends the influence of the American element over the South Sea, the captivating, magic power which the great republic exercises over the Spanish colonies * will not fail to make itself felt also in the Philippines. The Americans are evidently destined to bring to a full development the germs originated by the Spaniards. As conquerors of modern times, they pursue their road to victory with the assistance of the pioneer's axe and plough, representing an age of peace and commercial prosperity in contrast to that bygone and chivalrous age whose champions were upheld by the cross and protected by the sword.

A considerable portion of Spanish America already belongs to the United States, and has since attained an importance which could not possibly have been anticipated either under the Spanish Government or during the anarchy which followed. With regard to permanence, the Spanish system cannot for a moment be compared with that of America. While each of the colonies, in order to favour a privileged class by immediate gains, exhausted still more the already enfeebled population of the metropolis by the withdrawal of the best of its ability, America, on the contrary, has attracted to itself from all countries the most energetic element, which, once on its soil and, freed from all fetters, restlessly progressing, has extended its power and influence still further and further. The Philippines will escape the action of

* I take the liberty, here, of citing an instance of this. In 1861, when I found myself on the West Coast of Mexico, a dozen backwoods families determined upon settling in Sonora (forming an oasis in the desert); a plan which was frustrated by the invasion at that time of the European powers. Many native farmers awaited the arrival of these immigrants in order to take them under their protection. The. value of land in consequence of the announcement of the project rose very considerably.

the two great neighbouring powers all the less for tbe fact that neither they nor their metropolis find their condition of a stable and well-balanced nature.

It seems to be desirable for the natives that the above-mentioned views should not speedily become accomplished facts, because their education and training hitherto have not been of a nature to prepare them successfully to compete with either of the other two energetic, creative, and progressive nations. They have, in truth, dreamed away their best days.
