One of the most interesting productions of the island is Manila hemp, so called by the French.  ; but hardly any use is made of it. On account of its peculiar silky appearance, it is also known as

The natives call it the bandála seed. In commerce, abacá is the plant where it comes from. It is a wild species of banana  known also as Arbol de Cáñamo (hemp-tree), Musa textilis, Lin. 

It looks like the edible banana tree (Musa paradisiaca), one of the most important plants of the torrid zone. <!-- , and familiar to us as being one of our most beautiful hot-house favourites. · Whether this and the “musa” (M. troglodytarum, M. sylvestris, and others), frequently known, too, as M. textilis, are of the same species, has not yet been determined. --> 

The species Musaceæ are herbaceous plants only. The outer stem consists of crescentshaped petioles crossing one another alternately, and encircling the thin main stem. These petioles contain a quantity of bast fibre, which is used as string, but otherwise is of no commercial value. The serviceable hemp fibre has, up to the present time, been exclusively obtained from the southern portion of the Philippines. The provinces of Camarines and Albay are favourably adapted for the cultivation of this plant, as are also the islands of ABACÁ CULTIVATION.


Sámar and Leyte, and the adjacent islands; and Cebú likewise, although a portion of the Cebú hemp comes from Mindanáo. In Negrós the best banana thrives only in the south, not in the north; and Yloilo, which produces much of the weaving hemp (guinára), is obliged to import the raw material from the eastern district, as it does not flourish in the island of Panáy.

In Cápiz, some abacá grow. But it is of little value. 

Hitherto all attempts, strenuous though the efforts were, to acclimatize the growth of hemp in the western and northern provinces have failed. The plants rarely grow as high as two feet, and the trouble and expense are simply unremunerative. This failure may be accounted for by the extreme dryness prevailing during many months of the year, whereas in the eastern provinces plentiful showers fall the whole year round. The great profit which the Manila hemp has yielded in the few years since its production, however, has given encouragement to still further experiments; so that, indeed, it will shortly be shown whether the cultivation of abacá is to be confined to its present limited area, while the edible species of banana has spread itself over the whole surface of the earth within the tropics. .

On the volcanic mountains of Western Java a species of the Musaceæ grows in great luxuriance. The Government has not, however, made any real effort to cultivate it, and what has been done in that respect has been effected, up to the present date, by private enterprise.

Various writers have stated that abacá is to be obtained in the north of the Celebes. Bickmore, however, says positively that the inhabitants having made great efforts in attempting its successful cultivation, have abandoned it again in favour of the cultivation of coffee, which is found to be far more profitable.* According to previous statements, Guadaloupe appears to be

able to produce abacá (fibre of the M. textilis ?) ;* and Pondicherry and Guadaloupe have produced fabrics woven from abaca, and French Guiana stuffs from the fibre of the edible banana ; † All these, however, are only experiments. Royle affirms that the Manila hemp (abaca fibre) excels the Russian in firmness, lightness, and strength in tension, as well as in cheapness, and that rope prepared from the latter becomes stiff in wet weather, and continues so afterwards; which doubtless may be avoided by an improvement in the manner of spinning, and subsequent judicious treatment. Through the better preparation of the raw material in Manila by means of adequate machinery, these difficulties have been overcome; but abacá no longer has the advantage of superior cheapness, as the demand has increased much faster than the supply. During the year 1859 it was worth from £22 to £25 per ton ; in 1868, £45 to £50 per ton ; while Russian hemp fetched £31 per ton. Thus in nine years it rose to double its value. In Albáy there are about twelve varieties of the best banana cultivated, which are particularly favoured by the qualities of the soil. The cultivation is extremely simple, and entirely independent of the seasons.

The plants thrive best on the slopes of the volcanic mountains (in which Albáy and Camarines abound), in open spaces of the woods protected by the trees, which cast their shadows to an extent of about sixty feet. In exposed level ground they do not thrive so well, and in marshy land not at all. In the laying out of a new plantation the young shoots are generally made use of, which sprout so abundantly from the roots that each individual

+ Report of the Commissioners, Exhibition 1867, iv. 102. The South American Indians have for a long time past employed the banana fibre in the manufacture of clothing material ;-(The Technologist, September, 1865, p. 89, from unauthenticated sources,) and in Lu-tschu the banana fibre is the only kind in use (“ Faits Commerciaux, No. 1514." p. 36).

Abacá not readily taking tar is, consequently, only used for running, and not standing, rigging:

one soon becomes a perfect plant. In favourable ground the custom is to allow a distance of about ten feet between each plant ; in poor ground six feet. The only care necessary is the extermination of the weeds, and clearing away the underwood during the first season; later on, the plants grow so luxuriantly and strongly that they entirely prevent the growth of anything else in their vicinity. The protection afforded by the shade of the trees at this period is no longer required, the young buds finding sufficient protection against the sun's rays under cover of the fanlike leaves. Only in exceptional cases, contrary to the usual practice, are the plants raised from seed. The fruit, when ready, is cut off and dried, though care must be taken that it is not over ripe; otherwise the kernels are found to be in an unsuitable condition.

These latter are about the size of peppercorns; and the extraction of them in the edible species almost always brings about decay.

Two days before sowing, the kernels are taken out of the fruit, and steeped overnight in water ; on the following day they are dried in a shady place; and on the third day they are sown in holes an inch deep in fresh, unbroken, and well-shaded forest ground, allowing six inches distance between each plant and row.

After a year the seedlings, which are then about two feet high, are planted out, and tended in the same way as the suckers. While many of the edible bananas bear fruit after one year, and a few varieties even after six months, the abacá plant requires on an average three years to produce its fibre in a proper condition; when raised from suckers four years ; and when raised from yearold seedlings, even under the most favourable conditions, two years. On the first crop, only one stalk is cut from each bush; but later on the new branches grow so quickly that they can be cut every two months. *

• A plant in full growth produces annually 30 cwt. bandala to the acre, whereas from an acre of flax not more than from 2 to 4 cwt. of pure flax, and from 2 to 8 cwt. seed can be obtained.

After a few years the plants become so strong and dense that it is scarcely possible to push through them. Bast is in its best condition at the time of blossoming; but, when the price of the fibre happens to stand high in the market, this particular time is not always waited for.

Plants which have blossomed cease to be profitable in any way, by reason of the fibre becoming too weak-a matter of too great nicety for the unpractical consumers on the other side of the Atlantic to decide upon, and one in which, despite inquiries and careful inspections, they might be deceived. There really is no perceptible reason why the fibre should become weaker through fructification, which simply consists in the fact of the contents of the vascular cells changing into soluble matter, and gradually oozing away, the consequence of which is that the cells of the fibre are not replenished. These, on the contrary, acquire additional strength with the age of the plant, because the emptied cells cling so firmly together, by means of a certain resinous deposit, that it is impossible to obtain them unbroken without a great deal of trouble. The idea may have erroneously arisen from the circumstance that, previously to drying, as with hemp, the old plants were picked out, and allowed to be thrown away, though not without considerably increasing the rate of pay, which already consumed the greater part of the general expenses.* In order to preserve the bast, the stalk above ground is closely pruned and freed from leaves and other encumbrances; each leaf is then singly divided into strips—a cross incision being made through the membrane on the inner or concave side, and connected by means of the pulpy parts (the parenchym) clinging together. In this manner as much as possible of the clear outer skin only remains behind.

* As Dr. Wittmack communicated to me, only fibre or seed can be obtained from hemp, as when the hemp is ripe, i.e. run to seed, the fibre becomes then both brittle and coarse. Possibly, in the flax cultivation, you may obtain frequently both seed and fibre ; but, after all, they are both of very little value.

MODE OF OBTAINING THE FIBRE.

313

Another method is to strip the bast from the undivided stem. To effect this the operator makes an oblique incision in the skin by the under part of the stalk, drawing the knife gradually to the tip, and stripping off the whole length as broad a piece as possible ; and the operation is repeated as many times as practicable.

This method of handling is more productive than the one previously described; but, on the other hand, it takes considerably more time, and for that reason is not often practised.

The strips of bast are then drawn under a knife, the blade of which is three inches broad by six long, fastened at one end to the extremity of a flexible stick so that it is suspended perpendicularly over a well-smoothed block, and at the other end to a handle connected by means of a cord to a treadle, which can be pressed firmly down, as occasion requires. The workman draws the bast, without any regard to quality, between the knife and block, commencing in the middle, and then from side to side. The knife must be free from notches, or all indentations, according to the direction of Father Blanco.* This work requires three men, whose pay generally is about 2 r. per day. One worker cuts up the stalks, strips off the leaves, and attends to the supply; the second, frequently a boy, spreads out the strips; and the third draws them under the knife. A single plant has been known to yield as much as two pounds of fibre; but the most favourable average rarely affords more than one pound, and plants grown in indifferent soil scarcely a sixth of that quantity. The plantations are worked either by the owner or by day-labourers, who, when the market prices are very low, take half share of the crop harvested by them. In these cases an industrious workman may obtain as much as one pico in a week. During my stay exceptionally low prices ruled -165 r. per pico, undelivered. The workman could, therefore,

in six days earn half the amount, viz., 8.25 r., at a rate of 1.375 r. per day.

The edges of the petioles, which contain much finer fibre than the middle parts, are separately divided into strips an inch wide, and with strong pressure are drawn several times under the knife. This substance, which is called lúpis, is in high request, being employed in the native weaving; while bandála is chiefly used for ships' rigging. *

Lúpis, according to the fineness of the fibre, is sorted into four classes—first, Binani; second, Totogna; third, Sogotan ; and fourth, Cadaclan. A bundle of these is then taken up in the left hand, and, while with the right the first three sorts are inserted between the fingers, the fourth is held between the thumb and forefinger. This last description is no longer used in fine weaving, and is therefore sold with bandála.

After the fine sorts have been pounded in a rice-mortar, in order to render the fibre soft and pliable, they are severally knotted into one another, and converted into web. Generally the first sort is worked as woof with the second as warp, and the third as warp with the second as woof. The fabrics so woven are nearly as fine as pine-stuffs (Nipis de Piña), and almost equal the best quality of cambric; and, notwithstanding the many little nodules occasioned by the tangling of the fibre, which may be discerned on close WORKING DETAILS.

* In 1868, £100 per ton was paid for lúpis, although only imported in small quantities-about five tons per annum-and principally used at one time in France in the manufacture of a particular kind of underclothing. The fashion soon, however, died out. Quitol, a less valuable sort of lúpis, could be sold at $75 per ton.

inspection, are clearer and stouter, and possess a warmer yellowish tint.*

In respect of these last three qualities—purity, flexibility, and colour—they stand in relation to cambric somewhat as cardboard to tissue-paper. In weaving such stuffs the fibres frequently break on account of their having been twisted instead of spun; and the repair in these cases is exceedingly troublesome. The finest stuffs require so great an amount of dexterity, patience, and time in their preparation, and for that reason are so expensive, that they can find no purchasers when in competition with the cheap, machine-worked goods of Europe. Their fine, warm yellowish colour also is objected to by the European women, who are accustomed to linen and calicoes strongly blued in the washing. In the country, however, they are esteemed very highly by the rich half-castes, who understand the real goodness of their qualities.

The fibres of the inner petioles, which are softer but not so strong as the outer, are called tupus, and sold with bandála, or mixed with tapis and used in the native weaving. Bandála also serves for weaving purposes ; and, in that portion of the Archipelago where the native abacá plantations are, the entire dress of both sexes is made of coarse guinára. Still coarser and stronger fabrics are prepared for the European market, such as crinoline and stiff muslin used by dressmakers. Before the arrival of the Spaniards the natives produced stuffs from abaca; which became an important article of export only some few decades since. This is in great measure due to the enterprising spirit of two American firms, and would not have been attained without great perseverance and liberal pecuniary assistance.

The plants flourish without any care or attention, the only

trouble being to collect the fibre; and, the bounteousness of Nature having provided them against want, the natives shirk even this trouble when the market price is not very enticing.

In general low prices are scarcely to be reckoned on, on account of the utter indifference of the Indians, over whom the traders do not possess any influence to keep them at work. Advances to them are made both in goods and money, which the creditor must repay either by produce from his own plantation or by giving an equivalent in labour.*

As long as the produce stands high in price, everything goes on pretty smoothly, although even then, through the dishonesty of the Indians, and the laziness, extravagance, and mercantile incapacity of the middle meň, considerable loss frequently ensues. If, however, prices experience any considerable fall, then the Indians seek in any and every way to get out of their uncomfortable position, whilst the percentage of profit secured to the middle man is barely sufficient to cover the interest of his outlay. Nevertheless, they must still continue the supplies, inasmuch as they possess no other means of securing payment of their debt in the future.

. The Indians, in their turn, bring bitter complaints against the agents, to the effect that they are forced to severe labour, unprofitable to themselves, through their acceptance of advances made to them at most exorbitant rates; and the agents (generally halfcastes or creoles) blame the crafty, greedy, extortionate foreigners,

* By agricultural means, also, the half-castes and Indians secure the work of their countrymen by making these advances, and renewing them before the old ones are paid off. These thoughtless people consequently fall deeper and deeper into debt, and become virtually the slaves of their creditors, it being impossible for them to escape in any way from their position. The “part-share contract” is much the same in its operative effects, the landlord having to supply the farmer with agricultural implements and draught-cattle, and often in addition supplying the whole family with clothing and provisions; and, on division of the earnings, the farmer is unable to cover his debt. It is true the Indians are responsible legally to the extent of five dollars only, a special enactment prohibiting these usurious bargains. As a matter of fact, however, they are generally practised.

who shamelessly tempt the lords of the soil with false promises, and effectuate their utter ruin. As a general rule, the “crafty foreigner” experiences à considerable diminution of his capital. It was just so that one of the most important firms suffered the loss of a very large sum. At length, however, the Americans, who had capital invested in this trade, succeeded in putting an end to the custom of advances, which hitherto had prevailed, erected stores and presses on their own account, and bought through their agents direct from the growers. All earlier efforts tending in this direction had been effectually thwarted by the Spaniards and creoles, who considered the profits derived from the country, and especially the inland retail trade, to be their own by prescriptive right. They are particularly jealous of the foreign intruders, who enrich themselves at their expense; consequently they place every obstacle in their way. If it depended upon the will of these people, all foreigners would be ejected from the country—the Chinese alone, as workmen (coolies), being allowed to remain.*

The same feeling was exhibited by the Indians towards the Chinese, whom they hated for being industrious and trustworthy workers. All attempts to carry out great undertakings by means of Chinese labour were frustrated by the native workmen intimidating them, and driving them away either by open violence or by secret persecution; and the Colonial authorities were reproached for not affording suitable protection against these and similar outrages. That, as a rule, great undertakings did not succeed in the Philippines, or at least did not yield a profit commensurate with the outlay and trouble, is a fact beyond dispute, and is solely to be ascribed to many of the circumstances related above. There are those, however, who explain these mishaps in other ways, and insist upon the fact that the Indians work well enough when they are punctually and sufficiently paid. The Government, at any rate, appear gradually to have come to the conclusion that the resources of the country cannot be properly opened up without the assistance of the capital and enterprise of the foreigners; and therefore, of late years they have not in any way interfered with their establishment. In 1869 their right of establishment was tardily conceded to them by law. At this period the prospects of the abacá cultivation seemed very promising; and since the close of the American war, which had the effect of causing a considerable fall in the value of this article in America, the prices have been steadily increasing.

* This feeling of jealousy had very nearly the effect of closing the new harbours immediately after they were opened.

It is stated (on authority) that, in 1840, 136,034 picos of abaca, to the value of 397,995 dollars, were exported, the value per pico being reckoned at about 2 dollars 9 cents. The rate gradually rose and stood between 4 and 5 dollars—and, during the civil war, reached the enormous sum of 9 dollars per pico—the export of Russian hemp preventing, however, a further rise. This state of affairs occasioned the laying out of many new plantations, the produce of which, when it came on the market, after three years, was valued at 3 dollars 50 cents per pico, in consequence of the prices having returned to their normal condition ; and even then it paid to take up an existing plantation, but not to lay out a new one. This rate continued until 1860, since which time it has gradually risen (only during the American war was there any stoppage), and it now stands once more as high as during the civil war; and there is no apparent prospect of a fall so long as the Philippines have no competitors in the trade.

In 1866 the pico in Manila never cost less than 7 dollars, which two years previously was the maximum value ; and it rose gradually, until 9 dollars 50 cents was asked for ordinary qualities. The production in many provinces had reached the extreme limit; and a further increase, in the former at least, is impossible, as the work of cultivation occupies the whole of the

male population-an evidence surely that a suitable recompense will overcome the natural laziness of the natives.* .

An examination of the following table will confirm the accuracy of these views :

The consumption in the country is not contained in the above schedule, and is difficult to ascertain ; but it must certainly be very considerable, as the natives throughout entire provinces are clothed in guinára, the weaving of which for the family requirements generally is done at home. Sesal, also sesal-hemp, or, as it is sometimes known, Mexican grass, has for some years past been used in the trade in increasing quantities as a substitute for abaca, which it somewhat resembles in appearance, though wanting that fine gloss which the latter possesses. It is somewhat weaker, and costs from £5 to £10 less per ton; it is only used for ships' rigging. The refuse from it has been found an extremely useful adjunct to the materials ordinarily used in the manufacture of paper. The Technologist for July, 1865, calls attention to the origin of this substitute, in a detailed essay differing essentially from the representations contained in the “ U.S. Agricultural Report” published at Washington in 1870 ; and the growing

importance of the article, and the ignorance prevailing in London as to its extraction, may render a short account of it acceptable. The description shows the superior fineness of the abacá fibre, but not its greater strength.*

Sesal-hemp, which is named after the export harbour of Sisal (in the N. W. of the peninsula), is by far the most important product of Yucatan ; and this rocky, sun-burnt country seems peculiarly adapted to the growth of the fibre. In Yucatan the fibre is known as “jenequem,” as indeed the plant is obtained from it. Of the latter there are seven sorts or varieties for purposes of cultivation ; only two, the first and seventh, are also to be found in a wild state. First, Chelem, apparently identical with Agave angustifolia ; this ranks first. Second, Yaxci (pronounced Yachki; from yax, green, and tri, agave), the second in order; this is used only for fine weaving. Third, Sacci (pronounced Sakki; sack, white), the most important and productive, supplying almost exclusively the fibre for exportation ; each plant yields annually 25 leaves, weighing 25 lbs., from which is obtained 1 lb. of clear fibre. Fourth, Chucumci, similar to No. 3, but coarser. Fifth, Babci; the fibre very fair, but the leaves rather small, therefore not very productive. Sixth, Citamci (pronounced Kitamki; kitam, hog); neither good nor productive. Seventh, Cajun or Cajum, probably Fourcroya cubensis ; leaves small, from four to five inches long. The cultivation of sesal has only in recent times been prosecuted vigorously; and the extraction of the fibre from the leaves, and the subsequent spinning for ships' rigging, are already done by extensive steammachinery. This occupation is especially practised by the Maya

* In the Agricultural Report of 1869, p. 232, another fibre was highly mentioned, belonging to a plant very closely related to sesal (Bromelia Sylvestris), perhaps even a variety of the same. The native name, "jxtle," is possibly derived from the fact of their curiously flattened, spiky-edged leaves, resembling the dentated knives formed from volcanic stone (obsidian) possessed by the Aztecs, and termed by them “ iztli.”

Indians, a memorial of the Toltecs, who brought it with them upon their emigration from Mexico, where it was in vogue long before the arrival of the Spaniards.

The sesal cultivation yields an annual profit of 95 per cent. A mecate, equal to 576 square yards (varas), contains 64 plants, giving 64 lbs. of clear fibre, of the value of 3 dollars 84 cents; which, after deducting 1 dollar 71 cents, the cost of obtaining it, leaves 2 dollars 13 cents remaining. The harvesting commences from four to five years after the first laying out of the plantation, and continues annually for about fifty or sixty years.

In tropical countries there is scarcely a hut to be seen without banana trees surrounding it; and the idea presented itself to

neglected, which might be done by the mere labour of obtaining it; besides which, the little labour required for their proper cultivation is quickly and amply repaid by their abundant fruitfulness.* This idea, however, under the existing circumstances, would certainly not be favourable to the Philippines,

* The banana trees are well known to be among the most valuable of plants to mankind. In their unripe state they afford starch-flour; and when mature, they supply an agreeable and nutritious fruit, which, althou;h partaken of freely, will produce neither unpleasantness nor any injurious after-effects. One of the best of the edible species bears fruit as early as five or six months after being planted, suckers in the meantime constantly sprouting from the roots, so that a continual fructification is going on, the labour of the growers merely being confined to the occasional cutting down of the old plants and to gathering in the fruit. The broad leaves afford to other young plants the shade which is so requisite in tropical countries, and are employed in many useful ways about the house. Many a hut, too, has to thank the banana trees surrounding it for protecting it from the conflagration, which, generally speaking, lays the village in ashes. I should here like to make an observation upon a mistake which has spread rather widely. In Bishop Pallegoix's excellent work, " Description du Royaume Thai ou Siam," I. 144, he says: “L'arbre à vernis qui est une espèce de bananier, et que les Simaios appellent órak,' fournit ce beau vernis qu'on admire dans les petits meubles qn'on apporte de Chine.” When I was in Bangkok, I called the attention of the amiable white-haired, and at that time nearly nonogenarian, bishop to this curious statement. Shaking his head, he said he could not have written it. I showed him the very passage. “Ma foi, j'ai dit une bêtise ; j'en ai dit bien d'autres,” whispered he in my ear, holding up his hand as if afraid somebody might overhear him.

as it does not pay to obtain bast from the genuine abaca plant as soon as it has borne fruit. The fibre of the edible banana might very well be used as material for paper-making, though obtaining it would cost more than the genuine bandála. In the Report of the Council of the Society of Arts, London, May 11th, 1860, attention was called to a machine invented by F. Burke, of Montserrat, for obtaining fibre from banana and other endogenous plants.

While all the earlier machines worked the fibre parallelwise, this one operated obliquely on it; the consequence of which was that it was turned out particularly clear. With this machine, from seven to nine per cent. of fibrous substance may be obtained from the banana. The Tropical Fibre Company have sent these machines to Demerara, also to Java and other places, with the design of spinning the fibre of the edible banana, and also to utilise some portions of the plant as materials in the manufacture of paper. Proofs have already been brought forward of fibre obtained in this manner in Java, the value of which to the spinner has been reckoned at from £20 to £25. It does not appear, however, that these promising experiments have led to any important results; at least, the consular reports which have come to hand contain no information on the subject. In the obtaining of bandála in the Philippines this machine has not yet been used ; nor has it even been seen, though the English consul, in his latest report, complains that all the hitherto ingeniously constructed machines have proved virtually useless. The bast of the edible banana continues still to be used in the Philippines, notwithstanding that the plants, instead of being grown, as in many parts of America, in large well-tended gardens, are here scattered around the huts : but the forwarding of the raw material, the local transport, and the high freightage will always render this material too expensive for the European market (considering always its very ordinary quality)-£10 per ton at the very least; PAPER MATERIAL.

323

while “Sparto grass” (Lygieum spartum, Læffl.), which was imported some few years since in considerable quantities for the purposes of paper-making, costs in London only £5 per ton.*

The jute (Corchorus casularis) coffee-sacks supply another cheap paper material. These serve in the fabrication of strong brown packing paper, as the fibre will not stand bleaching. According to P. Symmonds, the United States in recent years have largely used bamboo. The rind of the Adansonia digitata also yields an extremely good material ; in particular, paper made entirely from New Zealand flax deserves consideration, being, by virtue of its superior toughness, eminently suited for “ bill paper."

It must not be overlooked that, in the manufacture of paper, worn linen and cotton rags are the very best materials that can be employed, and make the best paper. Moreover, they are generally to be had for the trouble of collecting them, after they have once covered the cost of their production in the form of clothing materials; when, through being frayed by repeated washings, they undergo a preparation which particularly adapts them to the purposes of paper-making.

The more paper-making progresses, the more are ligneous fibres brought forward, particularly wood and straw, which produce really good pastes ; all the raw materials being imported from a distance. That England takes so much sparto is easily explained by the fact that she has very little straw of her own, for most of the corn consumed by her is received from abroad in a granulated condition.

* In 1862, England took from Spain 156 tons ; 1863, 18,074 tons; 1866, 66,913 tons; 1868, 95,000 tons; and the import of rags fell from 24,000 tons in 1866 to 17,000 tons in 1868. In Algiers a large quantity of sparto (Alfa) grows, but the cost of transport is too expensive to admit of sending it to France.
