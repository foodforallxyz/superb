The history of coffee in the Philippines is very similar to that of cacao. 

The plant thrives wonderfully, and its berry has so strongly marked a flavour that the worst Manila coffee commands as high a price as the best Java. 

In spite of this, however, the amount of coffee produced in the Philippines is very insignificant, and, until lately, scarcely deserved mention. 

According to the report of an Englishman in 1828, the coffee-plant was almost unknown 40 years before, and was represented only by a few specimens in the Botanical Gardens at Manila. 

It soon, however, increased and multiplied, thanks to the moderation of a small predatory animal (paradoxurus musanga), which only nibbled the ripe fruit, and left the hard kernels (the coffee beans) untouched, as indigestible. 

The Economical Society bestirred itself in its turn by offering rewards to encourage the laying out of large coffee plantations. In 1837 it granted to M. de la Gironnière a premium of 1,000 dollars, for exhibiting a coffee plantation of 10,000 plants, which were yielding their second harveste; and four premiums to another in the following year. 

But as soon as the rewards were obtained the plantations were once more allowed to fall into neglect. 

From this it is pretty evident that the enterprise, in the face of the then market prices and the artificially high rates of freight, did not afford a sufficient profit.


Year | Export in picos
--- | ---
1856 | under 7,000 picos
1865 | 37,588
1871 | 53,370.

This increase, however, affords no criterion by which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations, for these make no returns for the first few years after being laid out. 

In short, larger exports may be confidently expected. But even greatly increased exports could not be taken as correct measures of the colony's resources. Not till European capital calls large plantations into existence in the most suitable localities will the Philippines obtain their proper rank in the coffee-producing districts of the world.

The best coffee comes from the provinces of Lagúna, Batangas and Cavíte. The worst comes from Mindanáo because of careless treatment which leads to bad beans. The coffee beans of Mindanao are of a yellowish white colour and flabby. Those of Lagúna are smaller, but much firmer in texture.

Manila coffee is very highly esteemed by connoisseurs, and is very expensive, though it is by no means so nice looking as that of Ceylon and other more carefully prepared kinds. 

Remarkably in 1865, France imported only 105,000 francs worth of Philippine hemp. But it imported more than 1,000,000 francs worth of Manila coffee, 1/3 of the entire coffee produce of the islands.* 

Manila coffee is not much prized in London, and does not fetch much more than good Ceylon (60s. per cwt.).† This, however, is no reproach to the coffee, as every one acquainted with an Englishman's appreciation of coffee will allow.

California is an excellent customer. It is always ready to give a fair price for a good article, will in time become one of its principal consumers. 

In 1868, coffee in Manila itself cost on an average 16 dollars per pikul. 

In Java, the authorities pay the natives, who are compelled to cultivate it, about 3 dollars per pikul.

Although the amount of coffee exported from the Philippines is trifling in comparison with the producing powers of the colony, it compares favourably with the exports from other countries.

In my “Sketches of Travel,” I compared the decrease of the coffee produced in Java under the forced system of cultivution with the increase of that voluntarily grown in Ceylon, and gave the Javanese produce for 1858 as 67,000 tons, and the Cingalese as 35,000 tons. 

Since then, the relative decrease and increase have continued ; and in 1866 the Dutch Indies produced only 56,000 tons, and Ceylon 36,000 tons.*

In 1865-66-67 California imported 31, 8, and 10 million lbs. of coffee, of which 2, 4, and 5 millions respectively came from Manila. In 1868 England was the best customer of the Philippines,



During my enforced stay in Darága, the natives brought me mussels and snails for sale. 

Several of them wished to enter my service, as they felt “a particular vocation for Natural History.” 

At last my kitchen was always full of them. They sallied forth every day to collect insects, and as a rule were not particularly fortunate in their search. But this was of no consequence; in fact, it served to give them a fresh appetite for their meals. 

Some of the neighbouring Spaniards paid me almost daily visits; and several of the native and half-caste dignitaries from a distance were good enough to call upon me, not so much for the purpose of seeing my humble self as of inspecting my dwelling, the fame of which had spread over the whole province. 

It was constructed in the usual judicious mushroom shape, covered with nito, † and its pinnacle was adorned with a powerful oil lamp, furnished with a closely fitting lid, like that of a dark lantern, so that it could be carried in the pocket. This last was particularly useful when riding about on a dark night.

In the neighbouring pueblo cigar-cases were made out of this nito. They are not of much use as an article of commerce, and usually are only made to order. To obtain a dozen a would-be purchaser must apply to as many individuals, who, at the shortest,

* Coffee is such an exquisite beverage, and is so seldom properly prepared, that the following hints from a master in the art (Report of the Jury, Internat. Exhib.; Paris, 1868) will not be unwelcome:

1. Select good coffee
2. Mix them in the proper proportions
3. Thoroughly dry the beans, otherwise in roasting them a portion of the aroma escapes with the steam
4. Roast them in a dry atmosphere, and roast each quality separately
5. Allow them to cool rapidly. If it is impossible to roast the beans at home, then purchase only sufficient for each day's consumption. 

Except for the fourth, it is easy to follow all these directions at home. Small roasting machines are purchaseable, in which, with the aid of a spirit lamp, small quantities can be prepared at a time. 

It is best, when possible, to buy coffee in large quantities, and keep it stored for two or three years in a dry place.

will condescend to finish one in a few months. The stalk of the fern, which is about as thick as a lucifer match, is split into four strips. The workman then takes a strip in his left hand, and, with his thumb on the back and his forefinger on the edge, draws the strips up and down against the blade until the soft pithy parts are cut away, and what remains has become fine enough for the next process. The cases are made on pointed cylindrical pieces of wood almost a couple of feet long. A pin is stuck into the centre of the end of the cylinder, and the workman commences by fastening the strips of fern stalk to it. The size of the case corresponds to the diameter of the roller, and a small wooden disk is placed in the bottom of the case to keep it steady while the sides are being plaited.

When my ancle began to get better, my first excursion was to Legaspi, where some Indians were giving a theatrical performance. A Spanish political refugee directed the entertainment. On each side of the stage, roofed in with palm leaves, ran covered galleries for the dignitaries of the place; the uncovered space between which was set apart for the common people. The performers had chosen a play taken from Persian history. The language was Spanish, and the dresses were, to say the least, eccentric. The stage was erected hard by a public street, which itself formed part of the auditorium, and the noise was so great that I could only catch a word here and there. The actors stalked on, chattering their parts, which not one of them understood, and moving their arms up and down; and, when they reached the edge of the stage, they tacked and went back again like ships sailing against the wind. Their countenances were entirely devoid of expression, and they spoke like automatons. If I had understood the words, the contrast between their meaning and the machinelike movements of the actors would probably have been droll

enough; but, as it was, the noise, the heat, and the smoke were so great that we soon left the place.

Both the theatrical performance and the whole festival bore the impress of laziness, indifference, and mindless mimicry. When I compared the frank cheerfulness I had seen radiating from every countenance at the religious holidays of Europe with the expressionless and immobile faces of the Indians, I found it difficult to understand how the latter were persuaded to waste so much time and money upon a matter they seemed so thoroughly indifferent to.

Travellers have remarked the same want of gaiety amongst the Indians of America ; and some of them ascribe it to the small development of the nervous system prevalent among these peoples, to which cause also they attribute their wonderful courage in bearing pain. But Tylor observes that the Indian's countenance is so different from ours that it takes us several years to rightly interpret its expression. There probably is something in both these explanations. And, although I observed no lively expression of amusement among my native friends at Legaspi, I noticed that they took the greatest possible pleasure in decorating their village, and that the procession which formed part of the festival had extraordinary charms for them. Every individual was dressed in his very best; and the honour of carrying a fighting cock inspired those who attained it with the greatest pride, and raised an amazing amount of envy in the breasts of the remainder. Visitors poured in from all the surrounding hamlets, and erected triumphal arches which they had brought with them ready-made, and which bore some complimentary inscription. I am obliged to confess that some of the holiday-makers were very drunk. The inhabitants of the Philippines have a great love for strong drink; even the young girls occasionally get intoxicated. When night came on, the strangers were hospitably lodged in the dwellings of the village. On such occasions native hospitality

 
shows itself in a very favourable light. The door of every house stands open, and even balls take place in some of the larger hamlets. The Spanish and half-caste cavaliers, however, condescend to dance only with half-caste partners, and very seldom invite a pretty Indian girl to join them. The natives very rarely dance together; but in Sámar I was present on one occasion when a by no means ungraceful native dance was improvised on the spot. The men sang verses, and one of the dancers presented his partner with a rose, “begging her to be careful how she handled it, as no rose was without a thorn.” This would have been thought a charming compliment in the mouth of an Andalusian.

My idle existence in Darága was so agreeable to my servants and their many friends that they wanted me to stay there as long as possible. 

They adopted some very ingenious means to persuade me to do so. 

Twice, when everything was prepared for a start the next morning, my shoes were stolen in the night; and on another occasion they kidnapped my horse. 

When an Indian has a particularly heavy load to carry, or a long journey to make, he thinks nothing of coolly appropriating the well-fed beast of some Spaniard ; which, when he has done with it, he turns loose without attempting to feed it, and it wanders about till somebody catches it and stalls it in the nearest “Tribunal.” 

There it is kept tied up and hungry until its master claims it and pays its expenses. I had a dollar to pay when I recovered mine, although it was nearly starved to death, on the pretence that it had swallowed rice to that value since it had been caught.

Small robberies occur very frequently, but they are committed—as an acquaintance, a man who had spent some time in the country, informed me one evening when I was telling him my troubles—only upon the property of new arrivals. Old residents, he said, enjoyed a prescriptive freedom from such little inconveniences. I fancy some waggish native must have overheard our conversation, for early the next morning my friend, the old resident, sent to borrow chocolate, biscuits, and eggs of me, as his larder and his hen-house had been rifled during the night.

Monday and Friday evenings were the Darága market nights. in fine weather always afforded a pretty sight. The women, neatly and cleanly clad, sat in long rows and offered their provisions for sale by the light of hundreds of torches; and, when the business was over, the slopes of the mountains were studded all over with flickering little points of brightness proceeding from the torches carried by the homeward-bound market women. Besides eatables, many had silks and stuffs woven from the fibres of the pine-apple and the banana for sale. These goods they carried on their heads; and I noticed that all the younger women were accompanied by their sweethearts, who relieved them of their burdens.
