<!-- DIFFERENCE OF TIME. - COMMERCIAL RELATIONS OF THE PHILIPPINES.- PARTITION OF

THE WORLD.-FIRST ASPECT OF MANILLA.-EARTHQUAKES. -->

<!-- WHEN the clock strikes 12 in Madrid, it is 8:18pm and 41 seconds in Manila which lies 124° 40' 15" to the east of Madrid, 17 hours, 54 minutes, 35 seconds from Paris. 

Some time ago, however, while the new year was being celebrated in Madrid, it was only New Year's eve at Manila. -->

Magellan discovered the Philippines in his memorable first circumnavigation of the globe. He was following the sun in its apparent daily path around the world. Every successive degree he compassed on his eastern course added 4 minutes to the length of his day. 

When he reached the Philippines, the difference amounted to 16 hours. This apparently escaped his notice. Elcano, the captain of his only remaining vessel, was quite unaware on his return to the longitude of his departure, that, according to his ship's log-book, he was 1 day behind the time of the port his long-continued westward course had brought him back to.*


> * According to Albo's ship journal, he perceived the difference at the Cape de Verde Islands on July 9, 1522<!-- ; “Y este dia fue miercoles, y este dia tienen ellos por jueves." -->


The error remained also unnoticed in the Philippines. It was still, over there, the last day of the old year, while the rest of the world was commencing the new one. 

This state of things continued until the close of 1844, when it was resolved, with the approval of the archbishop, to pass over New Year's eve for altogether. *

Since that time, the Philippines lie no longer in the distant west, but in the far east, and are about 8 hours in advance of Spain.

The proper field for their commerce, however, is what is to us the far west. They were colonised thence, and for centuries they had no communication with Europe but an indirect one, by the annual voyage of the galleon between Manila and Acapulco. 

Now, however, when the eastern shores of the Pacific are at last beginning to teem with life, and, with unexampled speed, are pressing forward to grasp their stupendous future, the Philippines will no longer be able to remain in their past seclusion. No tropical Asiatic colony is so favourably situated for communication with the west coast of America ; and it is only in a few matters that the Dutch Indies can compete with them for the favours of the Australian market. But, on the other hand, they will have to abandon their traffic with China, whose principal emporium Manila originally was, as well as that with those westward-looking countries of Asia, our own far east, which lie the nearest to the Atlantic ports.f

Had the circumstances we have mentioned been left unnoticed, 

* In a note on the 18th page of the masterly English translation of Morga, I find the curious statement that a similar rectification was made at the same time at Macao, where the Portuguese, who reached it on an easterly course, had made the mistake of a day the other way.

+ Towards the close of the sixteenth century the duty upon the exports to China amounted to 40,000 dollars, and their imports to at least 1,330,000 dollars. In 1810, after more than two centuries of undisturbed Spanish rule, the latter had sunk to 1,150,000 dollars. Since then they have gradually increased ; and in 1861 they reached 2,130,000 dollars.

the Philippines, or at any rate, the principal market for their commerce, would have fallen within the limits of the western hemisphere, to which indeed they were relegated by the illustrious Spanish geographers at Badajoz.

The Bull issued by Alexander 6th on May 4, 1493. It divided the world into 2 hemispheres. 

All heathen lands in the eastern half should belong to the Portuguese. The western half to the Spaniards. 

According to this arrangement, the latter could only claim the Philippines under the pretext that they were situated in the western hemisphere. 

The demarcation line was to run from the north to the south, a hundred leagues to the south-west of all the so-called Azores and Cape de Verde islands. In accordance with a treaty negotiated between Spain and Portugal on the 7th of June, 1494, and approved by Julius 2nd in 1506. 

This line was drawn 370 leagues west of the Cape de Verde islands.

At that time, Spanish and Portuguese geographers reckoned 174 leagues to a degree on the equator.

In the latitude of the Cape de Verde Islands, 370 leagues made 21° 55'. If to this we add the longitudinal difference between the westernmost point of the group and Cadiz, a difference of 18° 48', we get 40° 43' west, and 139° 17' east from Cadiz (in round numbers 47° west and 133° east), as the limits of the Spanish hemisphere. At that time, however, the existing means for such calculations were entirely insufficient.

The latitude was measured with imperfect astrolabes, or wooden quadrants, and calculated from very deficient maps; the variation of the compass, moreover, was almost unknown, as well as the use of the log. * Both method and instruments were wanting for

* According to Gehler's “ Phys. Lex.” the log was first mentioned by Purchas in an account of a voyage to the East Indies in 1608. Pigafetta does not cite it in his treatise on navigation ; but in the forty-fifth page of his work it is said: “ Secondo la misura che facevamo del viaggio colla cadena a poppa, noi percorrevamo 60 a 70 leghe al giorno." This was as rapid a rate as that of our fastest steamboats-ten knots an hour.

useful longitudinal calculations. It was under these circumstances that the Spaniards attempted, at Badajoz, to prove to the protesting Portuguese that the eastern boundary line intersected the mouths of the Ganges, and proceeded to lay claim to the possession of the Spice Islands.

The eastern boundary should, in reality, have been drawn 461 further to the east, that is to say, as much further as it is from London to the coast of Labrador, or to the lesser Altai; for, in the latitude of Calcutta 46° are equivalent to 2,575 nautical miles. 

Albo's log-book gives the difference in longitude between the most eastern islands of the Archipelago and Cape Fermoso (Magellan's Straits), as 106° 30', while in reality it amounts to 159° 85'.

The disputes between the Spaniards and the Portuguese, occasioned by the uncertainty of the eastern boundary-Portugal had already founded a settlement in the Spice Islands—were set at rest by an agreement made in 1529, in which Charles V. abandoned his pretended rights to the Moluccas in favour of Portugal, for the sum of 350,000 ducats. The Philippines at that time were of no value.

Manila lies 650 nautical miles south-east of Hongkong, a distance that the mail östeamer running between the two ports accomplishes in from three to four days. This allows of a fortnightly postal communication between the colony and the rest of the world.*

* The European post reaches Manila through Singapore and Hong-Kong. Singapore is about equidistant from the other two places. Letters therefore could be received in the Philippines as soon as in China, if they were sent direct from Singapore. In that case, however, a steam communication with that port must be established, and the traffic is not yet sufficiently developed to bear the double expense. According to the report of the English Consul (May, 1870), there is, besides the Government steamer, a private packet running between Hongkong and Manila. The number of passengers it conveyed to China amounted, in 1868, to 141 Europeans and 3,048 Chinese ; total, 3,489. The numbers carried the other wa'y were 330 Europeans and 4,664 Chinese; in all, 4,994. The fare is 80 dollars for Europeans and 20 for Chinamen.


This small steamer is the only thing to remind an observer at Hongkong, a port thronged with the ships of all nations, that an island, so specially favoured in organisation and fertility, lies in such close proximity.

Although the Philippines belong to Spain, there is but little commerce between the two countries. Once the tie which bound them was so close that Manila was wont to celebrate the arrival of the Spanish mail with Te Deums and bell-ringing, in honour of the successful achievement of so stupendous a journey. 

Until Portugal fell to Spain, the road round Africa to the Philippines was not open to Spanish vessels. Its advantages, as compared with those of the overland route, are shown by the fact that in 1603 two Augustine monks, who were entrusted with an important message for the king, and who chose the direct line through Goa, Turkey, and Italy, took three years in reaching Madrid.

The heavy tax which the Spanish flag imposed upon trade had the effect, in spite of the protective duty in favour of national products, of restricting the imports of the colony to the merchandise of alien countries, and the consignment of its exports to foreign ports. The traffic with Spain was limited to the conveyance of officials, priests, and their usual necessaries, such as provisions, wine and other liquors; and, except a few French novels, some atrociously dull books, histories of saints, and similar works.

The Bay of Manila is large enough to contain the united fleets of Europe ; it has the reputation of being one of the finest in the world. The aspect of the coast, however, to a stranger arriving, as did the author, at the close of the dry season, falls short of the lively descriptions of some travellers. 

The circular bay, 120 nautical miles in circumference, the waters of which wash the shores of five different provinces, is fringed in the neighbourhood of Manila by a level coast, behind which rises an equally flat tableland. The scanty vegetation in the foreground, consisting chiefly of bamboos and areca palms, was dried up by the sun; while in the far distance the dull uniformity of the landscape was broken by the blue hills of San Mateo.

In the rainy season the numerous bankless canals overflow their borders and form a series of connected lakes, which soon, however, change into luxuriant and verdant rice-fields.

Manila is situated on both sides of the river Pasig. The town itself, surrounded with walls and ramparts, with its low tiled roofs and scattered towers, had, in 1859, the appearance of some ancient European fortress. Four years later the greater part of it was destroyed by an earthquake.

On June 3, 1863 at 7:31pm an earthquake shook the preparations for the festival of Corpus Christi. 

The firmest buildings reeled visibly, walls crumbled, and beams snapped in two. The dreadful shock lasted half a minute; but this little interval was enough to change the whole town into a mass of ruins, and to bury alive hundreds of its inhabitants. 

A letter of the Governor-General, which I have seen, states that the cathedral, the government-house, the barracks, and all the public buildings of Manila were entirely destroyed, and that the few private houses which remained standing threatened to fall in. Later accounts speak of 400 killed and 2,000 injured. The estimate was a loss at $8m. 

46 public and 570 private buildings were thrown down. 28 public, 528 private buildings were nearly destroyed. All the houses left standing were more or less injured.

At the same time, an earthquake of 40 seconds' duration occurred at Cavite, the naval port of the Philippines, and destroyed several buildings.

3 years later, the Duke of Alençon (Luzon and Mindanao; Paris, 1870) found the traces of the catastrophe everywhere. 

Three sides of the principal square of the city, in which formerly stood the government-house, the cathedral, and the town-house, were lying like dust heaps overgrown with weeds. All the large public edifices were “temporarily” constructed of wood; but no one appeared to have thought of building anything permanent.

Manila is very often subject to earthquakes. 

The most fatal occurred in 1601; in 1610 (Nov. 30th); in 1645 (Nov. 30th); in 1658 (Aug. 20th); in 1675; in 1699; in 1796; in 1824; in 1852; and in 1863. 

In 1645, 600, or, according to some accounts, 3,000 persons perished, buried under the ruins of their houses. The monastery, the church of the Augustines, and that of the Jesuits, were the only public buildings which remained standing.

Smaller shocks, which suddenly set the hanging lamps swinging, occur very often and generally remain unnoticed. The houses are on this account generally of but one story, and the loose volcanic soil on which they are built tends to lessen the violence of the shock. Their heavy tiled roofs, however, appear very inappropriate under the circumstances. 

Earthquakes are also of frequent occurrence in the provinces, but they, as a rule, cause so little damage, owing to the houses being constructed of timber or bamboo, that they are never mentioned,

M. Alexis Perrey gives, in the memoirs of the Dijon Academy for 1850, a catalogue, collected with much diligence from every accessible source, of the earthquakes which have visited the Philippines, and particularly Manila. But the accounts, except of the most important, are very scanty, and the dates of their occurrence very unreliable. Of the minor shocks, only a few are mentioned, those which were noticed by scientific observers accidentally present at the time.

Aduarte mentions a tremendous earthquake which occurred in 1610. I briefly quote his version of the details of the catastrophe, as I find them mentioned nowhere else.

“ Towards the close of November, 1610, on St. Andrew's Day, a more violent earthquake than had ever before been witnessed, visited this island ; its effects extended from Manila to the extreme end of the province of New Segovia (in the far north of Luzon), a distance of 200 leagues. It caused great destruction over the whole area ; in the province of Ilocos it swallowed up palm trees, and left only the tops of their branches above the earth's surface; its shock dashed hills on the opposite sides of valleys together, threw down many buildings, and killed a great number of people. Its fury was greatest in New Segovia, where it rent mountains asunder, and created new lake basins. 

The earth threw up immense fountains of sand, and vibrated so terribly that the people, unable to stand upon it, laid down and fastened themselves to the ground, as if they had been on a ship in a stormy sea. In the range inhabited by the Mendayas a mountain fell in, • crushing a village and destroying its inhabitants. 

An immense portion of the cliff sank into the river; and now, where the stream was formerly bordered by a range of hills of equal altitude, its banks are level with the watercourse. The commotion was so great in the bed of the river that waves arose like those of the ocean, or as if the water had been lashed by a furious wind. 

Those edifices which were of stone suffered the most damage, our church and the convent fell in, etc"
