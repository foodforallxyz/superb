A family consisting of father, mother, and five children requires daily nearly 24 chupas of palay (rice in the husk), which, after winnowing, comes to about 12 chupas. 

This at the average price of 4 reals per caban costs about half a real. The price, however, varies. 

Sometimes, after the harvest, it is 3 reals per caban. Before it, ten ; and in Albay, even about thirty reals. Then about three cuartos are wanted for extras (as fish, crabs, vegetables, etc.), which, however, are generally collected by the children ; and, lastly, for oil two cu., buyo one cu., tobacco three cu. (three leaves for one cu.), the latter being smoked, not chewed. A woman consumes half as much buyo and tobacco as a man. Buyo and tobacco are less used in Leyté than in Sámar.

For clothing a man requires yearly-four rough shirts of guinara, costing from one to two reals; three or four hose, at one to two and a half reals ; two handkerchiefs for the head, at one and a half real (hats are not worn on the south and west coasts), and for the church festivals generally one pair of shoes, seven reals; one fine shirt, a dollar or more; and fine hose, four reals. A woman requires—four to six camisas of guinara, at one real; two to three sayas of guinara, at three to four reals, and one or two sayas of European printed cotton, at five reals; two handkerchiefs, at one and a half to two reals; and one or two pairs of slippers (chinelas) to go to mass in, at two reals and upwards.

The women generally have, besides, a fine camisa costing at least six reals; a mantilla for churchgoing, six reals (it lasts four years); and a comb, two cu. Many also have under-petticoats (nabuas), two pieces at four reals, and earrings of brass and a rosary, which last articles are purchased once for all. In the poorer localities, Láuang for instance, only the home-woven guinaras are worn; and there a man requires—three shirts and three hose, which are cut out of three pieces of guinara, at two reals, and a salacot (hat), generally home made, worth half a real ; while a woman uses, yearly-four sayas, value six reals; and a camisa, with a finer one for the feasts, eight reals. Underpetticoats are not worn ; and the clothing of the children may be estimated at about half of the above rates.

For household furniture a family has a cooking pot * of unglazed burnt clay, imported by ships from Manila, the cost of which is fixed by the value of its contents in rice; a supply of bamboo-canes; seven plates, costing between two and five cu.; a carahai (iron pan), three to four reals; cocoa-nut shells serving for glasses; a few small pots, altogether half a real ; a sundang, four to six reals, or a bolo (large wood knife), one dollar; and a pair of scissors (for the women), two reals. The loom, which every household constructs for itself of bamboo, of course costs nothing.

The rate of daily wages, in the case of native employers, is half a real, without food; but Europeans always have to give one real and food, unless, by favour of the gobernadorcillo, they get polistas at the former rate, which then regularly goes into the public coffers. An ordinary carpenter earns from one to two reals; a skilful man, three reals daily. The hours of work are from six to noon, and from two to six in the evening.

Almost every village has a rude smith, who understands the making of sundạngs and bolos; but the iron and the coal required for the purpose must be supplied with the order. No other work in metal is executed. With the exception of a little shipbuilding, hardly any other pursuit than weaving is carried on; the loom is rarely wanting in a household. Guinara, i.e., stuff made of the abaca, is manufactured, as well as also some piña, or figured silk stuffs, the silk being brought from Manila, and of Chinese origin. All these fabrics are made in private homes ; there is no factory.

In places where rice is scarce the lower class of people catch COMMERCIAL LIFE.

fish, salt and dry them, and barter them for rice. In the chief towns purchases are made with the current money; but, in the interior, where there is hardly any money, fabrics and dried fish are the most usual means of exchange. Salt is obtained by evaporating the sea-water in small iron hand-pans (carahais), without previous evaporation in the sun. 

The navigation between Catbalogan and Manila continues from December to July, and in the interval between those months the ships lie dismantled under sheds. There also is communication by the coast eastwards to Guíuan, northwards to Catárman, and sometimes to Láuang. The crews consist partly of natives, and partly of foreigners, as the natives take to the sea with great reluctance; indeed, almost only when compelled to leave their villages. 

Sámar has scarcely any other means of communication besides the navigation of the coast and rivers, the interior being roadless; and burdens have to be conveyed on the shoulders. An able-bodied porter, who receives a real and a half without food, will carry three arrobas (seventy-five pounds at most) six leagues in a day, but he cannot accomplish the same work on the following day, requiring at least one day's rest. A strong man will carry an arroba and a half daily for a distance of six leagues for a whole week.

There are no markets in Sámar and Leyté ; so that whoever wishes to buy seeks what he requires in the several houses, and in like manner the seller offers his goods.

An Indian seeking to borrow money has to give ample security and pay interest at the rate of one real for every dollar per month (twelve and a half per cent. monthly); and it is not easy for him to borrow more than five dollars, for which sum only he can be legally imprisoned, Trade and credit are less developed in eastern and northern Samar than in the western part of the island, which keeps up a more active communication with the other inhabitants of the Archipelago. There current money is rarely lent, but only its value in goods is advanced at the rate of 1 real per dollar per mensem. If the debtor fails to pay within the time appointed, he frequently has to part with one of his children, who is obliged to serve the lender for his bare food, without wages, until the debt has been extinguished. I saw a young man who had so served for the term of five years, in liquidation of a debt of five dollars which his father, who had formerly been a gobernadorcillo in Paranas, owed to a mestize in Catbalogan ; and on the east coast a pretty young girl, who, for a debt of three dollars due by her father, had then, for two years, served a native, who had the reputation of being a spendthrift. I was shown in Borongan a cocoa-nut plantation of three hundred trees, which was pledged for a debt of ten dollars about twenty years ago, since which period it had been used by the creditor as his own property; and it was only a few years since that, upon the death of the debtor, his children succeeded, with great difficulty, in paying the original debt and redeeming the property. It is no uncommon thing for a native to borrow two dollars and a half from another in order to purchase his exemption from the forty days of annual service, and then, failing to repay the loan punctually, to serve his creditor for a whole year. *

The inhabitants of Sámar and Leyté are:
- immediately idler and filthier than those of Luzon
- as much behind the Bicols as the Bicols are behind the Tagalogs. 

In Tacloban, where a more active intercourse with Manila exists, these qualities are less pronounced, and the women, who are agreeable, bathe frequently. For the rest, the inhabitants of the two islands are friendly, obliging, tractable, and peaceable. Abusive language or violence very rarely occurs, and, in case of injury, information is laid against the offender at the tribunal. Great purity of manners seems to prevail on the north and west coasts, but not on the east coast, nor in Leyté. External piety is universally conspicuous, through the training imparted by the priests; the families are very united, and great influence is wielded by the women, who are principally engaged in household employments, and are tolerably skilful in weaving, and to whom only the lighter labours of the field are assigned. The authority of the parents and of the eldest brother is supreme, the younger sisters never venturing to oppose it; women and children are kindly treated.


* As usual, these abuses spring from the non-enforcement of a statute passed in 1848 (Leg. ult, i. 144), which prohibits usurious contracts with servants or assistants, and threatens with heavy penalties all those who, under the pretext of having advanced money, or of having paid debts or the poll-tax or exemption from service, keep either individual natives or whole families in a continual state of dependence upon them, and always secure the increase of their obligations to them by not allowing them wayez sufficient to cnable them to satisiy the claims against them.


The natives of Leyté cling as strongly to their native soil as those of Sámar, like them, have no partiality for the sea, though their antipathy to it is not quite so manifest as that of the inhabitants of Sámar. *

There are no benevolent institutions in either of the two islands. 

Each family maintains its own poor and crippled, and treats them tenderly. In Catbalogan, the chief town of the island, with five to six thousand inhabitants, there were only eight recipients of charity; but in Albáy mendicants are not wanting. In Láuang, when a Spaniard, on a solemn festival, had caused it to be proclaimed that he would distribute rice to the poor, not a single applicant came forward. 

The honesty of the inhabitants of Sámar is much commended. 

Obligations are said to be contracted almost always without written documents, and never forsworn, even when they make default in payment. Robberies are of rare occurrence in Sámar, and thefts almost unknown. There are schools also here in the pueblos, which accomplish quite as much as they do in Camarines.

• Formerly it appears to have been different with them. “ These Bisayans are a people little disposed to agriculture, but practised in navigation, and eager for war and expeditions by sea, on account of the pillage and prizes, which they call inangubas,' which is the same as taking to the field in order to steal.”—Morga, f. 138.

Of the public amusements cock-fighting is the chief, but it is not so eagerly pursued as in Luzon. At the church festivals they perform a drama translated from the Spanish, generally of a religious character; and the expense of the entertainment is defrayed by voluntary contributions of the wealthy. 

The chief vices of the population are play and drunkenness; in which latter even women and young girls occasionally indulge. The marriage feasts, combining song and dance, often continue for several days and nights together, where they have a sufficient supply of food and drink. 

The suitor has to serve in the house of the bride's parents two, three, and even five years, before he takes his bride home; and money cannot purchase exemption from this onerous restriction. He boards in the house of the bride's parents who furnish the rice, but he has to supply the vegetables himself.*

At the expiration of his term of service he builds, with the assistance of his relations and friends, the house for the family which is about to be newly established.

Though adultery is frequent, jealousy is rare, and never leads to violence. The injured individual generally goes with the culprit to the minister, who, with a severe lecture to one, and words of consolation to the other, sets everything straight again. Married women are more easily accessible than girls, whose prospect of marriage, however, is hardly diminished by a false step during single life. While under parental authority girls, as a rule, are kept under rigid control, doubtless in order to prolong the time of servitude of the suitor. External appearance is more strictly regarded among the Bisayans than by the Bicols and Tagalese.

* Nl-usage prevails to a great extent, although prohibited by a stringent law; the non-enforcement of which by the alcaldes is charged with a penalty of 100 dollars for every single case of neglect. In many provinces the bridegroom pays to the bride's mother, besides the dower, an indemnity for the mother's milk which the bride has enjoyed (bigay susu). According to Colin (" Labor Evangelico," p. 129) the penhimuyat, the present which the mother received for night-watching and care during the bringing up of the bride, amounted to one-fifth of the dowry.

 
Here also the erroneous opinion prevails, that the number of the women exceeds that of the men. Instances occur of girls of twelve being mothers; but they are rare; and the women bear twelve or thirteen children, many of whom, however, do not live. So much so is this the case, that families of more than six or eight children are very rarely met with.

Superstition is rife. Besides the little Catholic images of . the Virgin, which every female Indian wears by a string round the neck, many also have heathen amulets, of which I had an opportunity of examining one that had been taken from a very daring criminal. It consisted of a small ounce flask, stuffed full of vegetable root fibres, which appeared to have been fried in oil. 

This flask, which is prepared by the heathen tribes, is accredited with the virtue of making its owner strong and courageous. The capture of this individual was very difficult; but, as soon as the little flask was taken from him, he gave up all resistance, and allowed himself to be bound. In almost every large village there are one or more Asuán families who are generally dreaded and avoided, and regarded as outlaws, and who can marry only amongst themselves. They have the reputation of being cannibals. Perhaps they are descended from such tribes ? At any rate, the belief is very general and firmly rooted ; and intelligent old Indians, when questioned by me on the subject, answered that they certainly did not believe that the Asuáns ate men at the present time, but that their forefathers had assuredly done so.*

Of ancient legends, traditions, or ballads, it is stated that there are none. It is true they have songs at their dances, but these are spiritless improvisations, and mostly in a high key. They have not preserved any memorials of former civilisation. “The

* Veritable cannibals are not mentioned by the older authors on the Philippines. Pigafetta (p. 127) heard that a people lived on a river at Cape Benuian (north of Mindanao) who ate only the hearts of their captured enemies, along with lemonjuice; and Dr. Semper (“* Philippines,” 62) found the same custom, with the excep. tion of the lemon-juice, on the east coast of Mindanao.

ancient Pintados possessed no temples, every one performing his anitos in his own house, without any special solemnity”—(Morga, f. 145 v). Pigafetta (p. 92) certainly mentions that the King of Cebu, after his conversion to Christianity, caused many temples built on the seashore to be destroyed; but these might only have been structures of a very perishable kind. 

On certain occasions the Bisayans celebrated a great festival, called Pandot, at which they worshipped their gods in huts, which were expressly built for the purpose, covered with foliage, and adorned with flowers and lamps. They called these huts simba or simbahan (the churches are so called to the present day), “and this is the only thing which they have similar to a church or a temple"-(Informe, I. i., 17). 

According to Gemelli Careri they prayed to some particular gods, derived from their forefathers, who are called by the Bisayans Divata, and by the Tagalese Anito. one anito being for the sea and another for the house, to watch over the children.* 

In the number of these anitos they placed their grandfathers and great grandfathers, whom they invoked in all their necessities, and in whose honour they preserved little statues of stone, wood, gold, and ivory, which they called liche or laravan. 

Amongst their gods they also reckoned all who perished by the sword, or were killed by lightning, or devoured by crocodiles, believing that their souls ascended to heaven on a bow which they called balangas. Pigafetta thus describes the idols which were seen by him :-“They are of wood, and concave, or hollow, without any hind quarters, with their arms extended, and their legs and feet bent upwards. They have very large faces, with four powerful teeth like boars' tusks, and are painted all over.” †

> *The Anito occurs amongst the tribes of the Malayan Archipelago as Antu. But the Anito of the Philippines is essentially a protecting spirit, while the Malayan Antu is rather of a demonical kind.

† These idol images have never come under my observation. Those figured in Bastian and Hartmann's “Journal of Ethnology" (b. i. pl. viii. “Idols from the


## EARLY RELIGION

The ancient religions of the Bisayans were noted by Fr. Gaspar:

The dæmon, or genius, to whom they sacrificed was called by them Diwata, which appears to denote an antithesis to the Deity, and a rebel against him. 

Hell was called Solad. 

Heaven (in their highly figurative language) Ologan

The souls of the departed go to a mountain in the province of Oton, called Medias, where they are well entertained and served.

The universe was created when a vulture hovering between heaven and earth could not find a place to settle. 

The water rises towards heaven and so Heaven, in its wrath, creates islands. 

The vulture then split a bamboo, out of which spring man and woman, who beget many children. When their number becomes too great, drive them out with blows. 
- Some conceal themselves in the chamber to become the Datos
- Others in the kitchen who then become the slaves.
- The rest go down the stairs and become the people.

<!-- Philippines)," whose originals are in the Ethnographical Museum of Berlin, were certainly acquired in the Philippines, but, according to A. W. Franks, undoubtedly belong to the Solomon Islands. Sections ii. to viji., p 46, in the cattlogue of the Museum at Prague are entitled :-"Four heads of idols, made of wood, from the Philippines, contributed by the Bohemian naturalist Thaddäus Hänke, who was commissioned by the King of Spain, in the year 1817, to travel in the islands of the South Sea." The photographs, which were obligingly introduced here at my desire by the direction of the museum, do not entirely correspond to the above description, pointing rather to the west coast of America, the principal field of Hänke's researches. The Reliquiæ Botanicæ, from his posthumous papers, likewise afford no information respecting the origin of those idols.
