Sugar cultivation increased in Iloilo, Antique, Panay, and Negros because of:
- the higher prices of directly-exported sugar
- the facility and security of the trade as contrasted with the late monopoly enjoyed by Manila

<!-- , have occasioned a great extension of the cultivation of that article. Not only in Yloílo, but also in  and Negrós, many new plantations have arisen, and the old ones have been enlarged as much as possible; and not less important has been the progress in the  -->

This led to the development of manufacturing.

In 1857, there were no iron sugar mills on the island. With a wooden sugar mill, only 30% of the sap remained in the cane, even after it had thrice passed through. 

The old wooden presses were worked by steam or buffaloes. They have now been replaced by new ones whichthe native planters easily obtain on credit from the warehouses of the English importers. 

Instead of using old Chinese cast-iron pans, they now import far superior articles from Europe. Many large factories worked by steam-power and with all modern improvements have been established. 

In agriculture, creditable progress is noticeable. 

Improved ploughs, carts, and farming implements generally, are to be had in plenty.

These changes naturally show how important it was to establish at different points, extending over 200 miles of the Archipelago, commercial centres, where it was desirable that foreigners should settle. 

Without these latter, and the facilities afforded to credit which thereby ensued, the sudden rise and prosperity of Yloilo would not have been possible, inasmuch as the mercantile houses in that capital would have been debarred from trading with unknown planters in distant provinces, otherwise than for ready money.

A large number of half-castes, too, who before traded in manufactured goods purchased in Manila, were enabled after this to send their goods direct to the provinces, to the foreign firms settled there; and as, ultimately, neither these latter nor the Chinese retail dealers could successfully compete with them, the result has been that, as much to their own profit as to that of the country, they have betaken themselves to the cultivation of sugar.


In this way, important plantations have been established in Negrós, which are managed by natives of Iloílo. But there is a scarcity of labourers on the island.

Foreigners now can legally acquire property, and possess a marketable title ; in which respect the law, until a very recent period, was of an extremely uncertain nature.

Land is to be obtained by purchase, or, when not already taken up, by “denuncia” (i.e. priority of claim). In such case, the would-be possessor of the land must enter into an undertaking in the nearest of the native Courts to cultivate and keep the said land in a fit and serviceable condition. 

Should no other claim be put in, notice is thereupon given of the grant, and the magistrate or alcalde concludes the compact without other cost than the usual stamp duty. Many half-castes and natives, not having the necessary capital to carry on a large plantation successfully, sell the fields which they have already partially cultivated to European capitalists, who are thus relieved of all the preliminary tedious work. 

Evidently, the Colonial Government is now sincerely disposed to favour the laying out of large plantations. The want of good roads is particularly felt : but, with the increase of agriculture, this defect will naturally be remedied ; and, moreover, most of the sugar factories are situated on rivers which are unnavigable even by flat freight boats.

The value of land in many parts of the country has doubled within the last ten years. *

Up to 1850 the pico of sugar was worth in Yloílo from 1 dol. 5 c. to 1 dol. 25 c., and seldom over 2 dols. in Manila; in 1866, 3 dols. 25 c.; and in 1868, 4 dols. 75 c. to 5 dols. in Yloilo.

* In Jaró the rents have increased threefold in six years : and cattle which were worth 10 dols. in 1860, fetched 25 dols. in 1866. Plots of land on the “ Ria," in Yloilo, have risen from 100 dols. to 500 dols., and even as high as 800 dols. (Diario, February, 1867). These results are to be ascribed to the sugar trade, which, through free exportation, has become extremely lucrative.

The business in Yloilo therefore shows an increase of 1 dol. 75 per pico. *

At the end of 1866 there were as many as twenty Europeans established on the island of Negrós as sugar planters, besides a number of half-castes. Most of them were working with steam machinery and vacuum pans. The general rate of pay is from 2 dols. 5 c. to 3 dols. per month. On some plantations the principle of “acsa," i.e. part share, is in operation. The owner lets out a piece of ground, providing draught cattle and all necessary ploughing implements, to a native, who works it, and supplies the mill with the cut cane, receiving as payment a share, generally a third, of the product.

In Negrós the violet cane is cultivated. In Manila the white (Otaheiti). The land does not require manuring.

On virgin soil, the cane often grows 13 feet high. A vast improvement is to be observed in the mode of dress of the people. Piña and silk stuffs are becoming quite common. 

Advance in luxury is always a favourable sign; according to the increase of requirements, industry flourishes in proportion.

**California, Japan, China, and Australia appear designed by nature to be the principal consumers of the products of the Philippine Islands.** 

Certainly at present, England is the best customer. But nearly half the account is for sugar, in consequence of their own custom duties.

Sometimes, it happens that not more than 1/4 of the sugar crop is sufficiently refined to compete in the Australian and Californian markets with the sorts from Bengal, Java, and the Mauritius. The remaining 3/4 if particularly white, must perforce undertake the long voyage to England, despite the high freight and certain loss on the voyage of from ten to twelve per cent. through the leakage of the molasses.

* In 1855 Yloilo took altogether from Negros 3,000 picos out of 11,700; in 1860 as much as 90,000 picos; in 1863, 176,000 picos (in twenty-seven foreign ships); in 1866, 260,000 picos ; in 1871, 312,379 picos from both islands.


The inferior quality of the Philippine sugar is at once perceived by the English refiners and is only taxed at 8 shillings per cwt. Purer sorts pay 10s. to 128.* 

In this way, the English customs favour the inferior qualities of manufactured sugar.

The colonial Government did not allow those engaged in the manufacture of sugar to distil rum from the molasses until the year 1862. They had, therefore, little inducement to extract, at a certain expense, a substance the value of which they were not permitted to realise. 

But under ordinary circumstances the distillation of the rum not only covered the cost of refining, but gave, in addition, a fair margin of profit.

• The sugar intended for the English market cost in Manila, in the years 1868 and 1869, from $15 to £16 per ton, and fetched in London about £20 per ton. The best refined sugar prepared in Manila for Australia was, on account of the higher duty, worth only £3 per ton more in London ; but, being £5 dearer than the inferior quality, it commanded a premium of £2. Manila exports the sugar chiefly from Pangasinan, Pampanga, and Laguna.-(From private information.)
