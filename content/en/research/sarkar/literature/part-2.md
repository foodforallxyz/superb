## The Litterateur as the Seer of Truth

Most of Sáhitya today is mere composition, not literature.

Litterateurs must prove their sense of responsibility through every line of their pens. 

Command over language and ideas is not sufficient. There must be:
- the power to delve deeply into any matter
- the earnest effort to:
  - identify the mind with the minds of all
  - penetrate into the essence of truth (Tattvadarshii). 

Those who, possessed with a little superficial knowledge of life, are mere jugglers of language, cannot produce ideal literature. 

In the language of the Vedas a litterateur is called Kavi or seer of truth. Only such seers can create true literature; for the task of a litterateur is to hint at the future, and the ability to look into the future belongs to the seers of truth alone.

Those who think that their only responsibility is to portray the past, present or future are not litterateurs, for the mastery over these three dimensions of time is determined by the power to link all the three. 

Those who cannot assimilate this internal link can never establish the proper relation between the past and the present, or between the present and the future; none of their portrayals of past, present or future are capable of finding complete expression. Therefore, as I have said above, it is better to call these writers mere authors, instead of litterateurs. 

It is such authors who indulge in such utterances as “Art for art’s sake.” A little examination will reveal the harmful influence of this idea on human society.

The world is the thought projection of the Cosmic Mind, and so there is no question of any pause, even for a moment, in this eternal flow. Whether humans may desire it or not, society will have to move forward through ceaseless environmental changes. Literature is the psychic expression of this dynamism of humanity. It is for this dynamic humanity that literature has been created, and so it cannot be static, nor shall it ever become static. 

[[The thought-provoking factors that underlie the social picture created by the brush of the artist, that underlie the current of thoughts expressed by the litterateur, change, and so the artist and the litterateur should always work keeping a vigilant eye on those changing factors.]] Although the momentum of society depends on various factors, it is largely determined by psychological and cultural transformations.


## Psychic Transformation

Changes in mental outlook are natural. 
- They do not take place in the same way at all times. 

To meet the necessities of the practical world, human beings must solve their mundane problems. 
- This changes the speed of the mind
- The psychic speed of human beings about 10,000 years ago was much greater than it was 1m years ago when Homo Sapiens just appeared.

The primitive mind used to move at a slow speed. Primitive people used to pass their days in the same environment for generations, solving the same types of problems. 

For tens of thousands of years, they subsisted on shrubs and weeds and used stone tools and weapons.

Then came the period of eating animal flesh. It took those ancient humans about 200,000-300,000 years to accustom themselves to this new habit. 

After the discovery of fire, even the use of salt on roasted meat was not learnt very easily.

But today, when we look back and examine the period from ten thousand years ago to five thousand years ago, we find that the speed of  human progress has greatly accelerated. 

Every 200-300 years, some new discoveries were made. As a result of facing ever newer challenges, the human mind underwent revolutionary changes:
- animal husbandry gave way to agriculture
- dispersed communities evolved into a more compact society. 

Between 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, there was no well-knit social order.
- But there were comprehensive efforts for social construction. 

In the Vedas, there is a vague picture of the varied advancements made during the past 5,000 years. 
- But it cannot be called rapid progress nowadays.

The Vedas are the literary reflection of the psychic characteristics of that period.

Yet in that age, when rays of light gradually pierced the darkness, people began to realize the necessity of moving more rapidly in unison. 

In some of the mantras and hymns of the Vedas, particularly in the Saḿgacchadhvam mantra, the seed of this very collective dynamism was sown.

The old world passed away, yielding to the new. 
- The speed of social momentum was greatly increased.

Even before the historically famous Buddhist era, well-constructed and dynamic societies had evolved in China and Egypt. 
- Yet the dynamism of these societies are not the second stage of progress.
- They were post-Vedic civilizations.
  - But in reality, they were part of that Vedic civilization with intrinsically distinctive characteristics.

The society of the Buddhist era quickened the progressive rhythm of the Vedic era.
- The Vedic social system stagnated and was caught in the various clashes and counter-clashes

The Buddhist era imparted new dynamism to the feeble, faltering steps of the Vedic era. 
- It awakened new vigour and impetus for advancement.
- It accelerated the progressive momentum of humanity far more than even the Vedic era.

That is why the literature of the Buddhist era has a more constructive, vibrant social picture, compared to the literature of the Vedic era.

The greater the clashes in human life, the faster the speed of the human mind because of circumstantial pressures.



The progress of society has gained unusual momentum from:
- the complexities of life
- the plethora of problems over the last 200 years.

This progress has developed naturally and will continue to do so.

The momentum of World War I and II has been dragging the society forcibly forward, as though human beings have become madly restless to triumph over time. 
- Due to their hyper-speed, humanity’s forward march has been losing its balance. 
- It achieves success on one hand, but faces grim failures on the other. 
- This frustration is glaringly manifest in every line of post-war literature – there is not a spark of bold vision anywhere.

With the capital of these frustrations and failures, litterateurs busily engage themselves in earning money.
- It is as if humanity is bent upon negating:
  - all the traditions of the 400 year-old Mauṋgalakavya(1)
  - the time-honoured Ramáyańa and the Mahábhárata
  - the revered poets like Shakespeare, Milton, Vidyápati and Cańd́idása
  - those works which championed both the learned and the illiterate like the Rámacaritamánasa. 

Although contemporary society is moving with increasing speed, it is incapable of preserving its balance.
<!-- - Litterateurs have been expressing this imbalanced state with their pens and thus conveying to their readers that they, too, are part of this unbalanced flow. -->


## Cultural Evolution

Cultural evolution <!-- has also brought about, and --> is continuing to bring about a considerable social change more or less uniformly in almost all countries.

Cultural evolution is not bad. 
- Defects in some societies are infecting others. 
- Yet even this interrelation has an immensely positive aspect. 
- This lets the human race gradually build a new human culture through mutual cooperation.

The different expressions of life are termed culture. 

The more the mutual contact and exchange of ideas between peoples of different countries, the closer people come to one another in the cultural sphere.
- The old, worn-out walls of literary tradition are crumbling in many places and smashed in other places. 

As a result, a new kind of international literature is evolving. 
- This is certainly an auspicious augury for the future. 

But even these auspicious developments from natural clashes may eventually end in frustration and failure.
- In the absence of honesty, simplicity, spiritedness and genuine human love, internationalism may remain limited to the litterateur’s caprice.
- The harshness of reality may not be tolerable to the litterateur.
- Thus we cannot surrender human destiny to the whims of the litterateur.

Litterateurs must not: 
- remain intoxicated with colourful imaginations
- drive humanity to despair by constantly harping on the failures of the practical world
- sing the songs of frustration. 

Litterateurs must be closely attuned to the changes in both:
- the psychological trends and
- the cultural evolution which remould the social structure.

All the creators of art should wield their pens or brushes with an aim to unify.
- Doing otherwise would be a sign of degeneration of their artistic talents

In fact, their contributions are then nothing but rubbish which becomes hazardous to the public. 

rtistic endeavour may be justified only when it results in the all-round development of society. If the litterateur’s inspiration propels the social movement in a particular direction, denying all other aspects of society, then in that case we cannot call it literature, because there is no real sentiment of benevolence behind that creation. 

The flow of ideas that are not complete in themselves are never capable of leading practical life towards fulfilment and perfection.


## Struggle Against Obstacles

So real artists or litterateurs should understand clearly:
- where the society is moving
- why it is moving in that direction
  - what are the fundamental causes of its inherent weakness 
  - from which doctrines the depraved propensities come from. 

The artists may have to resist the surging current of destruction alone.

Yadi tor dák shune keu ná áse
Tave eklá cala re…
[If none to my call pays heed,
Then alone must I proceed.]

While keeping this very refrain in mind, they must continue in their relentless effort to fight against the seemingly indomitable might of hundreds and thousands of obstacles which are deeply rooted in age-old superstitions that are firmly entrenched in petty selfishness.

Their pens may perhaps break into pieces, their brushes may perhaps be compelled to draw only lines of water on the canvas, and their histrionic flows may perhaps end in sheer mute stances, yet their efforts shall brook no pause. 

Each of their petty defeats shall be strung together as pearls in the garland of victory.

When the society spins for age after age in the mirey eddies of evil and vice, when individual and collective knavery masquerades as intelligence, when hypocrisy, bribery and fraud are the yardsticks of ability for leadership – it is then that the genuine followers of Bháratii (the goddess of learning) must struggle through constant humiliation. Only taunts and insults will be their fate. 

Those who are afraid of these insults are incapable of offering anything really lasting to humanity. How can those persons who have no moral firmness, under whose feet the soil is not hard and strong, impart happiness to anyone with a cool, refreshing shelter? It is perhaps possible to drag on in life by sucking the blood of others like social parasites, but this will not bring fulfilment to either the litterateurs or to their readers.

The artist or litterateur who assumes the responsibility of leading humanity to the path of light from the caverns of darkness will have to heed the road signs of that path. It is not possible to guide others merely with cheap, superficial knowledge, like a half-baked pandit who reads a half-a-dozen books and then spouts a few mouthfuls of grandiloquence, and who has obtained a doctorate degree by plagiarising others’ works. Rather it is necessary to have a keen and vigorous insight, without which all the endeavours of a litterateur or an artist will prove fruitless. 

Mere jugglery of words or depiction of defects in society will not satisfy the hunger of the human mind – and such creations of art are indeed valueless for social progress as well. One must know the path, and one must also know how to move on it. If those who have not comprehended what the form of the society will be allow the trends of the past that have shaped the present to proceed unchecked, then they can never lead the society to the path of perfection. 

They will:
- thrust the society into darkness in the name of social reform
- encourage license in the name of freedom
- mould the image of the goddess after the ideal of a prostitute
<!-- Instead of modelling a woman after the ideal of a goddess, rather they . -->

## Intimate Relation with the People

Litterateurs are epoch-makers and so they are the rśis (sages) and kavis (seers) of the society. 

They cannot afford to forget their dignified calling even for a moment. They are the messengers of the mute masses – the guardians of the society. The slightest mistake on their part may result in catastrophe, and even a bit of caution may open up many new possibilities. 

So a person whose thought and expression are not restrained, had better not meddle with the practice of art. I have just said that it is through the coordination of psychological and cultural trends that literature proves its worth. Intellectual trends and cultural evolution cannot exist by themselves, disregarding the individual or humanity as a whole, for both intellectual and cultural developments concern humanity. 

Humanity does not mean merely a few favoured persons in the upper stratum of society, like the special delicacies placed on top of the pile of rice offerings to the gods in the temples. 

Humanity means those very people who, like the pile of rice, have borne the weight of those delicacies on their heads. 

Those special delicacies should not represent any particular elite person or persons at the peak of society. 

Rather they should be regarded as the combined expression of the collective mind. 

The artists who guide that collective expression towards more and subtle forms, will have to maintain an intimate relation with the psychological and cultural structures of the people, with the innate characteristic (práńa dharma) of their existence. They must not disregard or neglect them even for a moment. 

If the artists remain preoccupied in floating like balloons in the sky while forgetting the people of the soil, all their creations will end in smoke after a mere momentary flash before the eyes. Their writings will not make any lasting impression on the pages of time.


## Building the Road to the Future

<!-- When changes in the society are somewhat accelerated due to various intellectual or cultural causes, then those creations that come into being in the aftermath of a particular situation are certainly fit to be called literature; but this sort of literature loses its practical value in later stages due to the rapid changes in society.  -->

It is wrong to think that Epochal Literature will become valueless in time. This literature will:
- be recorded in history
- carry special value for the litterateurs of the future.

From it, they will get an inkling of the social trend of that period. 

Those who scorn Epochal Literature should know that all the sweetness of the Coastal Literature is inherent in the many forms, in the richness of thought, of this Epochal Literature.

The endeavour of the artist of the era (yuga shilpii) alone can resist a powerful degeneration or a great catastrophe. There the creators of Coastal Literature are only mute spectators. They will continue to interpret morality, but their ability to awaken the spirit of dynamic heroism is considerably limited. The creator of Epochal Literature goes on constructing the road by excavating earth and shattering rocks and stones, while the Coastal Litterateur, perched on the summit of a mountain, goes on making sketches of that very scene and at intervals explains the science of building roads.

With the increase in society’s dynamism, the duration of effectiveness of Epochal Literature decreases. 

By the pressure of speed it becomes exhausted within a very short time. But in this there is no cause for regret; because the very task of building the road continues, and its relationship with Coastal Literature also remains intact. Epochal Literature is mainly concerned with time, place and person: so if there is the slightest increase in the attempt to triumph over any one of these three relative factors for whatever reason, the speed of the society as well as of the Epochal Literature gets accelerated; whereas Coastal Literature, in spite of maintaining these relative factors within its scope, does not confine itself in their rhythmic movement. 

That is why the momentum of Coastal Literature is extremely vague – almost motionless and static – and thus we call it Tat́astha or Coastal.

The absolute truth is beyond the scope of time, space or person and also beyond expression, and thus it is not possible to create any literature at all around it. But the golden line with which this absolute truth has united the unit mind, originating from the relative factors of time, space and person, with its eternal soul – that much, at least, which we can express to some extent with language of our heart – this is what is called Tat́astha Sáhitya or Coastal Literature. The line which is neither river nor shore but is touching both is tat́a or coast. Standing on this coast, that which maintains the relation between the two, between the temporal and the eternal, is called tat́astha.
