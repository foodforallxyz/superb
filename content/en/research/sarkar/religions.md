## Buddhism and Sháuṋkara Philosophy

All Ástika or theistic Indian philosophies unanimously believe that Átman or unit consciousness is a continuous flow of Jiṋána or knowledge. 

This is called Vijiṋána in Páli. 

There is a continuous flow of Jiṋána, or in other words Jiṋána itself is a flow (Praváha). Every object in the universe has its own flow and wave or dynamic force. According to Yoga philosophy Paramátman or Supreme Consciousness is an infinite flow of Jiṋána.

Ekaḿ jiṋánam nityamádantashúnyam
Nányat kiḿcit varttate vastu satyam;
Tayor bhedo’smin indriyopádhiná vae
Jiṋánasyáyam bhásate nanyathaeva.
–Shiva Saḿhitá

Lord Buddha did not use the word Átman, hence there was a difference of opinion among the Bhikksus or Buddhist monks after his death. 

Three conferences were held to compile the Tripitaka or Buddhist scriptures in Páli

1. Vinaya Pitáka or the practical side
2. Suttapitaka or the theoretical side 
3. Abhidhamma Pitaka or the philosophical side.

All of these parts combined together were known as the Tripitaka and were called the Buddhist scriptures. The Bhikhus who patronized or supported the Sannyása Márga or the path of renunciation were not prepared to accept anything more than what was laid down in the Tripitaka, and hence they were called Sthavirávádii or Theravádii, the southern school of Buddhism. Those who were influenced by the Nyáya school of philosophy were called Mahásáḿghika or the northern school of Buddhism.

The word Páli originated from Pallii which means “rural”, rustic or unsophisticated. As Bhagaván Buddha preached in the language of common people, Hindu scholars called his language Bhákhá. Páli was also known as Páli Bháśa. The common people could not follow Saḿskrta which was the language of scholars only.

Later on the Mahásáḿghikas called themselves Maháyánii and they called the Sthaviravádiis Hiinayánii. But the Hiinayániis called themselves Theravádii. In India there was no state backing for Hiinayániis except at the time of the rulers Kaniska, and Vasiska, and hence the Hiinayána did not flourish. 

The Maháyána had state backing so it naturally had more followers. 

The philosophy of the Hiinayániis was preached in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Java and Borneo, etc., whereas the philosophy of the Maháyániis was propagated in India, Siberia, Japan Tibet, etc.

There are 4 kinds of philosophical doctrines among the Maháyániis caused by the difference of opinion in the Átman and its object.

Bhagaván Buddha used the word “Attá” in Páli for Átman. The word Attá is also used in place of “Self”. 

The Bhikkhus could not understand the sense in which Bhagaván Buddha used the word Attá.


## Cárváka

At the time of Buddha, Nástika Váda or non-belief in God was dominant. 

Maharśi Ajita Keshakamballi was the scholar of the Nástiká Váda. Most of the books on Nástikyaváda were written in incomprehensible language and so its propagation was not very widespread. Ajita Keshakambalii followed Cárváka who had a materialistic philosophy. The Cárváka school of philosophy believes in Caturbhúta or the four fundamental factors. 

This is also known as Dehátmaváda, that is, the belief that the body is everything and that the soul is identified with the body. This philosophy accepts Caturbhúta, namely earth, water, fire and air or Kśiti, ap, tejas and marut respectively. 

According to Cárváka, Caetanya or Conscious came into existence by the combination of the four bhútas in the same way as the mixing of lime and catechu produces a red colour. According to Cárváka, Paiṋcabhúta or the fifth factor is formed in this way and does not actually exist. Cárváka philosophy does not believe in Átman, Paramátman and the Vedas and hence Cárváka was termed Nástika, since those who do not believe in Átman, Paramátman or the Vedas are called Nástika ([[a]]theist).

Púrva Mimáḿsá school of philosophy also does not admit the existence of Paramátman. Kapila, the propounder of the Sámkhya philosophy, accepted Átman and the Vedas, but he did not believe in Paramátman. The Śad́adarshana or the six major school of theistic Indian Philosophy believe in the Vedas. The following are the six schools of philosophy.

(1) Kapila Sáḿkhya which accepts the existence of Prakrti and the Vedas but does not accept Paramátman.
(2) Pátaiṋjala Sáḿkhya which believes in innumerable Puruśas and one Prakrti. The creator of the universe according to this school cannot be a Mukta Puruśa or a liberated being.
(3) Gaotama Nyáya philosophy.
(4) Kańáda’s Nyáya philosophy or Vaesheśika.
(5) Jaemini’s Púrva Miimámsá or early Miimámsá philosophy which believes in Kriyákanda or the doctrine of action. Those who believe in this school accept the existence of heaven and hell.
(6) Uttára Miimámsá or later Miimámsá philosophy propounded by Vádráyaná Vyása believes in Brahma and the vedas but does not believe in Átman and Jagat or the world. This philosophy is commonly known as Vedanta philosophy.

- The Buddhist philosophy believes in all the 5 bhútas or fundamental factors
- Cárváka believes in Caturbhúta or 4 fundamental factors. 

Baoddha Darshana and Cárváka philosophy do come under the purview of Śad́adarshana. Neither of them believe in the Vedas. They are atheistic philosophies.

Pramána or validity is of 3 kinds:

1. Pratyakśa or direct knowledge
2. Anumána or inference
3. Agama or authority

Cárváka accepts only pratyakśa as pramána.

Pratyakśaeka pramáńaváditayá anumánáde
Ranaranaungiikáreńa prámáńyábhávát.
[Pratyakśa or perception is the only source of knowledge, and inference (Ańumána) and authority (Ágama) are not to be recognized as sources of knowledge.]

Buddha accepts karmaphala or the reactions of actions, whereas Cárváka does not.

Yávajjiivaḿsukhaḿ jiivaḿ násti mrtyuragocarah.
Yávajjiivet sukham jiivet Rńaḿkrtá [[ghrtaḿ]] pivet.
Na svargo na pavargo vá naevátma páralaokikam.
Bhasmiibhútasya dehasya purnarágamanaḿ kutah.

[As long as you live, you should live in joy and happiness for we do not know what happens after death. As long as one lives in the world, one should live in comfort and happiness. One should even eat clarified butter (ghee) by incurring debts, for there is neither heaven nor the reactions of actions, nor Átman or Soul, nor the world beyond death. After the body is cremated how can it be reborn again?]

There is another aspect of Cárváka philosophy, Dehaparińámáváda (i.e. The death of body signifies the end of everything).

Caturbhyokhalu bhútebhyo caetanyamupajáyate.
Kińvádibhyoh sametebhyo dravyebhyo madashaktivat.

[Out of the four fundamental factors emerges consciousness, just as red colour arises from the mixture of betel leaf, catechu and lime.]
In this respect Buddhist philosophy is superior to Cárváka philosophy. Bhagaván [Lord] Buddha says, Attá hi attánám náthah.

## Buddhism

India accepted Buddhism because:

1. The scholars of that time never preached philosophy to the common people. 

They hated the language of the common people and called it Bhákhá.

2. Back then, there was no Tattvadarshii or eminent philosopher. 

3. The people in general were not ready to accept the pandits or scholars. 

4. The Ácáryas of that age, Shrii Saiṋjaya and Shrii Gayá Kashyapa, could not convince Buddha. 

All these factors led to the wide propagation and acceptance of Buddhism.

Buddhism believes in rebirth and transmigration of souls, so the question arises: Who is reborn if there is no Átman? 

This became a point of controversy among the Bhikkus (monks) and later among the Maháyánii scholars.

Buddhism believes in Karmaphala or the reaction of actions. 
- If karmaphala is accepted, then who performs karma or action and who gets the karmaphala? 
- Therefore, the existence of Átman has got to be recognized.

Towards the end of Buddha’s life some of his disciples asked Buddha about the existence of God:
- Does God exist?
- Is it a fact that God does not exist?

Buddha remained silent on both questions.
- Some of his disciples interpreted this to mean that there is no God.
- Another section of disciples understood that God exists.
- A third section came forward with the interpretation that there is God, but God is beyond the expression of “Asti” and “násti” or “is” and “is not”; that is, God’s existence is inexplicable. 

Actually God is supramental.

Yato váco nivartante aprápya manasásaha,
Ánandaḿ brahmano vidvá má vibheti kutahcanah.

There are 4 sections in Buddhist philosophy:

1. Pratyakśa Váhya Vastuváda or Soutańtrika Darshana
2. Anumeya Váhya-vastuváda or Vaebháśika Darshana
3. Sarvashúnyaváda or Mádhyamika Darshana 
4. Kśańika Vijiṋánaváda or Baoddha Yogácára.

Pratyakśa Váhyavastuváda accepts the universe as infinite, that is, anádii and ananta or beginningless and infinite when Caetanya or Consciousness becomes álayiibhúta or objectivated then it becomes jiṋána. 

The outer world is transitory but due to rapid movement (Saiṋcara or Prati-saiṋcara: extroversion or introversion) it appears to exist constantly. 

According to Hindu philosophy Saiṋcara means “to go away from Brahma” and Pratisaiṋcara means “to come near to Brahma,” that is Saiṋcara means the Vikarśanii Shakti of Brahma and Prati-saiṋcara means the Ákarśanii Shakti of Brahma.

Anumeyaváhya Vastuváda accepts the waves of Jiṋána as a permanent entity (sattá). 

There is the external world but the world will never be realized. When the waves of consciousness (Jiṋána) come, the mind takes a form according to the Saḿskáras or potential reactions of past actions of the Citta or mental plate. Formations created in the mind are taken to be Satya or veracity. When Jiṋána comes in contact with Álambana or desideratum, Citta takes a form: it takes the outward álambana as the object realized.

Sarvashúnyaváda is also called Mádhyamika Darshana and was propounded by Shriinágárjuna. He did not accept the páiṋcabhaotika world or the world of the five fundamental factors. The external world which we see is Máyá or illusion. This philosophy is similar to Shaḿkara’s philosophy, Brahma Satyam jagatmithyá. According to Shaḿkara the universe has been created out of nothing and is like a dream, nothing more. Bhává i.e. something has been created out of Abhává i.e. nothing. This school of philosophy accepts only the present and ignores the past and the future. It also says that the universe will merge into nothing.

Kśańika-vijiṋánaváda does not admit the physical world: here everything is internal. 

Even álambana is internal. Whatever is seen in this physical world is pratikriyá or the outer projection of internal álambana. Átman is the collection of the “I” feelings. It is not a continuous flow but appears to be so on account of the quick succession of its creation and destruction.

During the age of Bhagaván Shaḿkarácárya there was no outstanding philosopher (tattvadraśt́a) among the Buddhists. 

Among different sections of the Buddhist schools of philosophy a serious dispute was going on. At that time Shrii Manadana Mishra was the only scholar who believed in Sarva Shúnyaváda or complete nihilism and he was also a Kriyá Káńdii or follower of the path of action. 

He debated with Shaḿkarácárya and was defeated.

According to Buddhist philosophy there are 4 noble truths (Satya) called Caturajja satya:

1. Duhkha or sorrow
2. Kárańa of duhkha or the cause of sorrow
3. Nivrtti of duhkha or the cessation of sorrow
4. Upáya of duhkha nivritti or the means of the cessation of sorrow.

The Vikrti or distortion of the Duhkhaváda or the school of pessimism became Atisukhaváda or ultra-hedonism. 
- Atisukhaváda was prevalent in Bengal, Assam and Tibet.

According to Buddhism, duhkha is Árya Satya or the absolute truth. 
- This is a wrong interpretation as it is only the Mánas or mind which experiences dukha. 
- Dukha can thus be only a relative truth. 
- It cannot be an absolute truth


## Shaḿkara’s Philosophy

Shaḿkarácárya was a Shaeva Tántrika or a practitioner of Tantra who followed Shiva. 

That is why he did not go against Tantraváda or the doctrine of Tantra. 

He believed in Nirguńa Brahma or the non-qualified Supreme Entity only. His theories to some extent fall in line with the theories of the Baoddha Shuńyaváda or the Buddhist nihilists. He did not believe in the existence of jagat or the physical world. He accepted Guńánvita Máyáváda or the doctrine of qualified illusion. Due to his influence Buddhist Tantra disappeared. In Hindu Tantra, gods and goddesses still remained. 

Even today the common people worship the goddesses of Buddhist Tantra like Tárá, Manasá (the goddess of snakes) Shiitalá, Bárahii etc. out of devotion.

Shúnyaváda was very influential during the time Shrii Shaḿkarácárya preached. Shrii Shaḿkarácárya accepted Uttára Miimáḿsá as later Miimáḿsá philosophy propounded by Shrii Vádaráyana Vyása.

Shrii Shaḿkarácárya discussed the following subjects with Buddhist philosophers. The Shúńyavádiis said that the universe came out of nothing and will go into nothing, that everything is a dream. This was questioned by Shaḿkara who said that even if the universe is nothing or a dreamland, there should be someone who witnessed the dream. The Shúnyavádiis replied that there was no dreamer. The universe is an illusion just as a rope mistaken for a snake is an illusion. Shaḿkara said, that could not be possible. The Shúnyavádiis replied that this could only be understood by Sádhaná while Shaḿkara said that it was not possible to have a dream without a dreamer. If the universe is an illusion like mistaking a rope for a snake, there had to be something like a rope which could be mistaken for the universe. 

Without a rope it would be impossible to mistake it for a snake. Besides this there must be a person to make the mistake. Similarly, there must be someone to experience the illusion of the universe. This means that there must be some other entity to experience it. Mádhyamika said that nothing does not mean actually nothing (Shúnya). What you call Brahma we call nothing. So the illusion of the universe is Brahma. That is,

Yathá shúnyavádináḿ shúnyaḿ
Brahma Brahmavidáḿstathá.

[What Brahma is to the Brahmavádiis, Shúnya or nothing is to the Shúnyavádins.]

Shaḿkara replied that this means that the one who sees and the object which is seen are both illusion. Where there is no one to see, who will mistake the rope for snake? The Shunyavadiis could not give any explanation for this. The Kshanikavadiis – those who believed in the doctrine of transience – explanation of Shaḿkara’s questions was that the illusion is always Kśanika or transient. Shaḿkara’s point was that he believed that Brahma was anádi and ananta but that Kśańa comes in a moment and disappears the very next moment. Thus where does the Kśanika entity come from? Something must exist between the span of creation and the span destruction. 

The Kśanikavádiis replied that it is destroyed with the creation, but Shaḿkara replied that this shows that there is no existence. The Kśańikavádiis felt defeated but they still replied that existence was negligible. This was not a satisfactory explanation. 

The scholars of the Pratyakśa Váhyavastuváda and Anumeya Váhyavastuváda argued for their philosophies but no one could withstand that questioning of Shamkaracarya, hence all the four sections of Buddhism were defeated by Shrii Shaḿkara. On defeat they made friends with Shrii Shaḿkara and accepted Kúlakuńd́alinii Tattva or the practice of raising the serpentine power in human beings, and as a result Baoddha Yogácára came into existence.

There are several defects in Shaḿkara’s philosophy. According to Shaḿkara the universe is based on a fixed object by the illusion of Máyá, which is called Brahma.

There is an illusion of a snake for a rope. Now the question arises, who has the illusion of a snake? One who already knows about snakes. If there is an illusion of the universe for Brahma it means that the real universe is somewhere else. Thus the theory Brahma satyam jagatmithya is defective. This is a wrong interpretation given by Shaḿkara. The Buddhists did not question it and hence it was accepted at the time.

Shaḿkara does not believe in jiiva and jagat. Thus the question arises, for what reason does the illusion exist?
Aśtákulácaláh saptasamudráh
Brahmapurandara dinakara rudrah.
Na tvam ná haḿ ná yaḿ lokah
Vyarthah kimarthaḿ kriyate shokah.

[The eight mountains, the seven seas, the creation, Brahmá, the sun, and the god of death, neither you, nor I, nor this world the are all non-existent. Why should you lament for something non-existent?]

The universe has not been created and hence there is no Saguńa Brahma or Qualified Supreme Entity. Shaḿkara believed only in Nirguńa Brahma or the non-qualified Supreme entity. Shaḿkara said that the universe is like a dream and the dreamer is also Brahma, as he did not believe in jiiva. When Brahma is Nirguńa how could Shaḿkara see, as seeing is a quality? But this was also forgotten by Shamkara.
Again, according to Shaḿkara’s philosophy what is seen and experienced is all due to the influence of Máyá. This means Máyá is also an entity which Advaetavada or monism cannot accept.

Shaḿkara’s philosophy believes in the necessity of sádhaná, but who will perform the Sádhaná when the existence of jiiva is not accepted?

When Brahma is anádi and ananta, why should Brahma be influenced by Máyá? Secondly, when the universe is created by the influence of Máyá, how is it that Brahma remains Nirguna? 

Máyá is a greater force than Brahma as it influences Brahma!

In addition, Shaḿkara says that there is nothing exactly like Máyá as it is an illusion. A person in the desert sees water, houses, and trees etc. from a distance but there is actually nothing. In the absence of Jiṋána the person experiences an illusion. When there is Vikára or distortion in Brahma, how can the universe be an illusion?

Shaḿkara says where there is Brahma there is Máyá. Then the question arises, is Máyá nothing? If there is no Máyá, how can it influence Brahma? To overcome this Shaḿkara says that it is not even nothing. It is inexplicable (anirvacaniiya). Again the question arises as to who created Máyá if Brahma did not create it. Then Máyá becomes Saguna Brahma.
Shaḿkara was able to defeat Buddhist philosophers only by a display of words. The Máyá of Shaḿkara is not the Prakrti of Ananda Marga.
One of the great critics of Shaḿkara philosophy was Jayanta Bhatta, the propounder Nyáya Manjari philosophy.


## Kápil Saḿkhya and Pátáiṋjala Yoga

The common features of these two philosophies include the following:

(1) Both believe in the existence of many Puruśas.
(2) Both believe that the universe is created by Prakrti for the satisfaction of these Puruśas. This is not logical as no bhoga or satisfaction is possible without the existence of mind. Puruśas do not have mind and they cannot be satisfied by the creation of the universe by Prakrti.
(3) Both believe that Prakrti is not within Puruśa but is a separate Entity. This is also illogical since Prakrti is only energy or the shakti of Puruśa, and like the dahika shakti or burning facility of agni or fire, it cannot be a separate entity. These philosophies are called Dvaetavádii or dualistic because they believe in two separate entities of Puruśa and Prakrti.
(4) In Sáḿkhya there is no god and thus it is called Niriishwaraváda or atheism, while Pátaiṋjala philosophy believes in God but does not believe in Brahma. This is therefore called Seshvaraváda or theism.
(5) Idol worship is supported by both these philosophies.


## Árya Samája

(1) It believes that jiiva, jagat and Brahma are all anádi. 

This only shows that jiiva and jagat do not need any further entity like Brahma and all the three alike are anádi. This is unacceptable as this leaves no necessity for sádhaná or spiritual practice which is the Dharma or essential duty of every jiiva or human being. This also does not explain the reason for action and progress in the universe.
(2) It believes in yajiṋas or sacrifices not as karma or action but as a for of worship. Yajiṋa means karma but in Árya Samája it means offering to agni or fire in a particular form. There is no rational meaning in performing such Yajiṋas.
(3) They also believe in pralaya or dissolution which is also irrational, since jiiva and jagat are anádi and as such there is no place for pralaya.

## Marxism

(1) It believes in equality between human beings which is only theoretical and not possible in practice because no two individuals are alike, hence they cannot be equal.
(2) This faith finds its field in the exploitation of poverty and hence it can only thrive in poverty-stricken areas.
(3) It has no tolerance for other religions or organizations.
(4) Its goal is purely imaginary equality.
(5) This faith exists on violence only.

Besides these, the following three groups belong to the Semitic [[faith]] – Muslims, Christians and Jews.
