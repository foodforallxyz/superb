{{< s v="261">}} The parable a grain that produces 7 spikes is an example of those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way. 
- Each spike has 100 grains. 
- Allah multiplies for whom He wills.

{{< s v="262">}} Those who spend their wealth without following up what they spent with reminders of their generosity or with insults, will have their reward with their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

{{< s v="263">}} Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by insults. 

{{< s v="264">}} Some people spend their wealth to be seen by the people and give reminders and hurtful words. 
- They do not believe in Allah and the Last Day. 
- They are like a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bare. 
- They gain nothing from their efforts. 

Muslims, do not nullify your charitable deeds by following their example. 

{{< s v="265">}} The parable of a garden on a hillside is a parable of those who spend their wealth to:
- seek Allah’s approval, and
- strengthen their souls. 

If heavy rain falls on it, its produce is doubled. 
- If no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough.

{{< s v="266">}} Would you like to have a garden of palms and vines with all kinds of fruit just for it to be burned down by a fiery tornado? <!--  in it for him, and old age has stricken him, and he has weak children—then a tornado with fire batters it, and it burns down? --> <!-- Thus Allah makes clear the signs for you, so that you may reflect. -->


{{< s v="267">}} Muslims, give of the good things you have earned, and from what We have produced for you from the earth. 

Do not pick the inferior things to give away, when you yourselves would not accept it except with eyes closed.

{{< s v="268">}} Satan:
- promises you poverty
- urges you to immorality

Allah:
- promises you forgiveness from Himself, and grace. 
- 269. gives wisdom to whomever He wills. 

<!-- Whoever is given wisdom has been given much good. But none pays heed except those with insight. -->

270. Allah knows whatever charity you give, or a pledge you fulfill. The wrongdoers have no helpers.

271. If you give charity openly, that is good. 

But if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy in private, that is better for you. 

It will atone for some of your misdeeds.

272. Their guidance is not your responsibility, because Allah guides whom He wills. 

Any charity you give is for your own good. Any charity you give shall be for the sake of Allah. Any charity you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.

273. It is for the poor; those who are restrained in the way of Allah, and unable to travel in
the land. The unaware would think them rich, due to their dignity. You will recognize
them by their features. They do not ask from people insistently.


274. Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately and publicly, will receive their reward from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

275. Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's touch.

That is because they say, “Commerce is like usury.” But Allah has permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may keep his past earnings, and his case rests with Allah. But whoever resumes—these are the dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide
forever.

276. Allah condemns usury, and He blesses charities. Allah does not love any sinful ingrate.

277. Those who believe, and do good deeds, and pray regularly, and give charity—they
will have their reward with their Lord; they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.

278. Muslims,  Fear Allah, and forgo what remains of usury, if you are believers.

279. If you do not, then take notice of a war by Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent,
you may keep your capital, neither wronging, nor being wronged.

280. But if he is in hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity
is better for you, if you only knew.

<!-- 281. And guard yourselves against a Day when you will be returned to Allah; then each soul
will be rewarded fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged. -->

282. Muslims, when you incur debt among yourselves for a certain period of time, write it down.

Have a scribe write in your presence, in all fairness. 

And let no scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him. 

So let him write, and let the debtor dictate.<!--  And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish nothing from it. --> 

But if the debtor is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with honesty.

Call to witness 2 men from among you. If 2 men are not available, then one man and 2 women whose testimony is acceptable to all—if one of them fails to remember, the other would remind her. 

Witnesses must not refuse when called upon.

Do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, including the time of repayment. 

That is more equitable with Allah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubt—except in the case of a spot
transaction between you—then there is no blame on you if you do not write it down. 

Let there be witnesses whenever you conclude a contract. Let no harm be done to either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is corruption on your part. 

{{< s v="283">}} If you are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit should be handed over. 

But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill his trust. <!-- , and let him fear Allah, his Lord. -->Do not conceal testimony. 

<!-- Whoever conceals it is sinner at heart. Allah is aware of what you do. -->

<!-- {{< s v="284">}} To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is
within yourselves, or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.  -->


285. The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, as did the believers. 

They all have believed in Allah, and His angels, and His scriptures, and His messengers: “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” 

And they say, “We hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our Lord. To you is the destiny.”

286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. 

To its credit is what it earns, and against it is what it commits. 

“Our Lord, do not condemn us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have burdened those before us. 

Our Lord, do not burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Master, so help us against the disbelieving people.”
