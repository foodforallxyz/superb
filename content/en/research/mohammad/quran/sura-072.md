Say, “It was revealed to me that a band of jinn listened in, and said, ‘We have heard a wondrous Quran.

2. It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it; and we will never associate anyone with
our Lord.

3. And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord--He never had a mate, nor a child.
4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense
about Allah.

5. And we thought that humans and jinn
would never utter lies about Allah.
6. Some individual humans used to seek
power through some individual jinn, but they
only increased them in confusion.
7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah
would never resurrect anyone.
8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled
with stern guards and projectiles.
9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but
whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait
for him.
10. We do not know whether ill is intended for
those on earth, or if their Lord intends good-
ness for them.

11. Some of us are righteous, but some of us are less than that; we follow divergent paths.

12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on earth, and that we cannot escape Him by fleeing.

13. And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Whoever believes in his Lord
fears neither loss, nor burden.
14. Among us are those who are submitting,
and among us are the compromisers. As for
those who have submitted—it is they who
pursue rectitude.
15. But as for the compromisers—they will be
firewood for Hell.’”
16. Had they kept true to the Path, We would
have given them plenty water to drink.

17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away
from the remembrance of his Lord, He will
direct him to torment ever mounting.
18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do
not call, besides Allah, upon anyone else.
19. And when the servant of Allah got up call-
ing on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.
20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never
associate anyone with Him.”
21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor
to bring you to right conduct.”
22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah,
and I will not find any refuge except with
Him.
23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and
His messages. He who defies Allah and His
Messenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in
which they will dwell forever.”
24. Until, when they see what they were prom-
ised, they will know who is weaker in helpers,
and fewer in numbers.
25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are
promised is near, or whether my Lord will ex-
tend it for a period.”
26. The Knower of the Invisible; He does not
disclose His Invisible to anyone.
27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He
then dispatches guards before him and be-
hind him.
28. That He may know that they have con-
veyed the messages of their Lord. He encom-
passes what they have, and has tallied every-
thing by number.

ter suited for recitation.
7. In the daytime, you have lengthy work to
do.
8. So remember the Name of your Lord, and
devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly.
9. Lord of the East and the West. There is no
god but He, so take Him as a Trustee.
10. And endure patiently what they say, and
withdraw from them politely.
11. And leave Me to those who deny the truth,
those of luxury, and give them a brief respite.

14. On the Day when the earth and the moun-
tains tremble, and the mountains become
heaps of sand.
15. We have sent to you a messenger, a witness
over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.
16. But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We
seized him with a terrible seizing.
17. So how will you, if you persist in unbelief,
save yourself from a Day which will turn the
children gray-haired?
18. The heaven will shatter thereby. His prom-
ise is always fulfilled.
19. This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let
him take a path to his Lord.
20. Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly
two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or one-
third of it, along with a group of those with
you. Allah designed the night and the day. He
knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He
has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what
is possible for you. He knows that some of
you may be ill; and others travelling through
the land, seeking Allah’s bounty; and others
fighting in Allah’s cause. So read of it what is
possible for you, and observe the prayers, and
give regular charity, and lend Allah a gener-
ous loan. Whatever good you advance for
yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better
and generously rewarded. And seek Allah’s
forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.
74. THE ENROBED
(al-Muddathir)

1. O
you Enrobed one.
2. Arise

14. And smoothed things for him.

he turned back and was proud.

be a stumbling block for those who disbe-

attain certainty; and those who believe may
increase in faith; and those given the Scrip-
ture and the believers may not doubt; and
those in whose hearts is sickness and the un-
believers may say, “What did Allah intend by
this parable?” Thus Allah leads astray whom
He wills, and guides whom He wills. None
knows the soldiers of your Lord except He.
This is nothing but a reminder for the mor-
tals.

I swear by the blaming soul.
Does man think that We will not reassem-
ble his bones?
4. Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his
fingertips.

him.

48. But the intercession of intercessors will not
help them.
7. When
vision is dazzled.
8. And
the moon is eclipsed.
And the sun and the moon are joined to-
gether.
10. On that Day, man will say, “Where is the

9.
11. No
indeed! There is no refuge.
12. To your
Lord on that Day is the settlement.
that Day man will be informed of eve-

behind.

you disregard the Hereafter.

And made of him the two sexes, the male

40. Is
He not Able to revive the dead?
76. MAN
(al-Insan)

1. Has
there come upon man a period of time
when he was nothing to be mentioned?
2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to
test him; and We made him hearing and see-
ing.
3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia-
tive or unappreciative.
4. We have prepared for the faithless chains,
and yokes, and a Searing Fire.
5. But the righteous will drink from a cup
whose mixture is aroma.
6. A spring from which the servants of Allah
will drink, making it gush abundantly.
7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day
whose ill is widespread.
8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor,
and the orphan, and the captive.
9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We
want from you neither compensation, nor
gratitude.
10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim
Day.”
11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of
that Day, and will grant them radiance and
joy.
12. And will reward them for their patience
with a Garden and silk.
13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi-
encing therein neither sun, nor frost.
14. Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit
brought low within reach.
15. Passing around them are vessels of silver,
and cups of crystal.
16. Crystal of silver—they measured them ex-
actly.
17. They will be served therein with a cup
whose flavor is Zanjabeel.
18. A
spring therein named Salsabeel.
Passing among them are eternalized
youths. If you see them, you would think
them sprinkled pearls.
19.
22777. THE UNLEASHED (al-Mursalat)
Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a
vast kingdom.
21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and
satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets
of silver. And their Lord will offer them a
pure drink.
22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are
well appreciated.”
23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon
you—a gradual revelation.
24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord,
and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer
among them.
25. And mention the Name of your Lord,
morning and evening.
26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself
to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.
27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and
leave behind a Heavy Day.
28. We created them, and strengthened their
frame; and whenever We will, We can replace
them with others like them.
29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let
him take a path to his Lord.
30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al-
lah is Knowing and Wise.
31. He admits into His mercy whomever He
wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre-
pared for them a painful punishment.
