A band of jinn listened in and said ‘We have heard a wondrous Quran.
- {{< s v="2" >}} It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it
- We will never associate anyone with our Lord.
- 3. Our Lord never had a mate, nor a child.
- 4. But the fools among us used to say nonsense about Allah.
- 5. We thought that humans and jinn would never utter lies about Allah.

6. Some humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they only increased them in confusion.

7. They thought, as you thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone.

8. We probed the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and projectiles.

9. We used to take up positions to listen in; but whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait for him.

10. We do not know whether ill is intended for those on earth, or if their Lord intends goodness for them.

11. Some of us are righteous. But some of us are not. We follow divergent paths.

12. We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on earth, and that we cannot escape Him by fleeing.

13. And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss, nor burden.

14. Among us are those who are submitting, and among us are the compromisers. As for
those who have submitted—it is they who pursue rectitude.

15. But as for the compromisers—they will be firewood for Hell.’”

16. Had they kept true to the Path, We would have given them plenty water to drink.

17. To test them with it. Whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will direct him to torment ever mounting.

18. The places of worship are for Allah. So do not call, besides Allah, upon anyone else.

19. And when the servant of Allah got up calling on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass.

20. Say, “I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him.”

21. Say, “It is not in my power to harm you, nor to bring you to right conduct.”
22. Say, “No one can protect me from Allah, and I will not find any refuge except with Him.
23. Except for a proclamation from Allah and
His messages. He who defies Allah and His
Messenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in
which they will dwell forever.”
24. Until, when they see what they were prom-
ised, they will know who is weaker in helpers,
and fewer in numbers.
25. Say, “I do not know whether what you are
promised is near, or whether my Lord will ex-
tend it for a period.”
26. The Knower of the Invisible; He does not
disclose His Invisible to anyone.
27. Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He
then dispatches guards before him and be-
hind him.
28. That He may know that they have con-
veyed the messages of their Lord. He encom-
passes what they have, and has tallied every-
thing by number.
