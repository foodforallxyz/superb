<!-- 1. Praise be to Allah, Originator of the heavens
and the earth, Maker of the angels messengers with wings—double, triple, and quadru-
ple. He adds to creation as He wills.  -->

<!-- 2. Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for the people, none can withhold it. And if He with-
holds it, none can release it thereafter. He is the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. -->

3. O people! Remember Allah’s blessings upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and
the earth? There is no god but He. So how are you misled?

4. If they reject you, messengers before you were also rejected. To Allah all matters are returned.

5. O people! The promise of Allah is true; so let not the lowly life seduce you, and let not the Tempter tempt you away from Allah.

6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his gang to be among the inmates of the Inferno.

7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh punishment, but those who believe and do
righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward.

8. What of him whose evil deed was made attractive to him, and so he regards it as good?
Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and He guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not
waste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah knows exactly what they do.

9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which agitate clouds, which We drive to a dead land, and thereby revive the ground after it had died. Likewise is the Resurrection.

10. Whoever desires honor—all honor belongs to Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure, and He elevates righteous conduct. As for those who plot evil, a terrible punishment awaits them, and the planning of these will fail.

11. Allah created you from dust, then from a small drop; then He made you pairs. No fe-
male conceives, or delivers, except with His knowledge. No living thing advances in years,
or its life is shortened, except it be in a Record. That is surely easy for Allah.

12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh, sweet, good to drink, while the other is salty
and bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat, and extract jewelry which you wear. And you
see the ships plowing through them, so that you may seek of His bounty, so that you may give thanks.

13. He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night; and He regu-
lates the sun and the moon, each running for a stated term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is
the sovereignty. As for those you call upon besides Him, they do not possess a speck.
14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your prayer. And even if they heard, they would
not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will reject your partnership. None
informs you like an Expert.

15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in need of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the Praiseworthy.

16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and produce a new creation.

17. And that would not be difficult for Allah. burdened soul can carry the burden of
another. Even if one weighted down calls for help with its burden, nothing can be lifted
from it, even if they were related. You are to warn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and
perform the prayer. He who purifies himself purifies himself for his own good. To Allah is
the ultimate return.

18. No
19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.
20. Nor are the darkness and the light.
21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat.
22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah
causes whomever He wills to hear, but you
cannot make those in the graves hear.
23. You
are only a warner.
We sent you with the truth; a bearer of
good news, and a warner. There is no com-
munity but a warner has passed through it.
25. If they disbelieve you, those before them
also disbelieved. Their messengers came to
them with the clear proofs, with the Psalms,
and with the Enlightening Scripture.
26. Then I seized those who disbelieved—so
how was My rejection?
27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down
water from the sky? With it We produce
fruits of various colors. And in the mountains
are streaks of white and red—varying in their
hue—and pitch-black.
28. Likewise, human beings, animals, and live-
stock come in various colors. From among
His servants, the learned fear Allah. Allah is
Almighty, Oft-Forgiving.
29. Those who recite the Book of Allah, and
perform the prayer, and spend of what We
24.
16436. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
have provided for them, secretly and pub-
licly, expect a trade that will not fail.
30. He will pay them their dues in full, and will
increase them from His bounty. He is Forgiv-
ing and Appreciative.
31. What We inspired in you, of the Book, is
the truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah
is Well-Informed of His servants, All-Seeing.
32. Then We passed the Book to those of Our
servants whom We chose. Some of them
wrong their souls, and some follow a middle
course, and some are in the foremost in good
deeds by Allah’s leave; that is the greatest
blessing.
33. The Gardens of Eden, which they will en-
ter. They will be adorned therein with gold
bracelets and pearls, and their garments
therein will be of silk.
34. And they will say, “Praise Allah, who has
lifted all sorrow from us. Our Lord is Most
Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
35. He Who settled us in the Home of Perma-
nence, by His grace, where boredom will not
touch us, and fatigue will not afflict us.”
36. As for those who disbelieve, for them is the
Fire of Hell, wherein they will never be fin-
ished off and die, nor will its punishment be
lightened for them. Thus We will repay every
ingrate.
37. And they will scream therein, “Our Lord,
let us out, and we will act righteously, differ-
ently from the way we used to act.” Did We
not give you a life long enough, in which an-
yone who wanted to understand would have
understood? And the warner did come to
you. So taste. The evildoers will have no
helper.
38. Allah is the Knower of the future of the
heavens and the earth. He knows what the
hearts contain.
39. It is He who made you successors on earth.
Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief will recoil
upon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers
adds only to their Lord's disfavor of them.
The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to
their perdition.
40. Say, “Have you considered those partners
of yours that you worship instead of Allah?
Show me what they have created on earth. Or
do they have any share in the heavens?” Or
have We given them a book whose clear
teachings they follow? In fact, the wrongdo-
ers promise one another nothing but delu-
sions.
41. Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest
they fall apart. And were they to fall apart,
there is none to hold them together except
He. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.
42. And they swore by Allah with their solemn
oaths, that if a warner came to them, they
would be more guided than any other people.
Yet when a warner came to them, it only in-
creased them in aversion.
43. Priding themselves on earth, and scheming
evil. But evil scheming overwhelms none but
its authors. Do they expect anything but the
precedent of the ancients? You will not find
any change in Allah’s practice, and you will
not find any substitute to Allah’s practice.
44. Have they not journeyed in the land and
observed the fate of those who preceded
them? They were superior to them in
strength. But nothing can defeat Allah in the
heavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omnisci-
ent and Omnipotent.
45. If Allah were to punish the people for what
they have earned, He would not leave a single
living creature on its surface. But He defers
them until a stated time. Then, when their
time has arrived—Allah is Observant of His
creatures.

a straight path.
The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci-
ful.
6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not
warned, and so they are unaware.
7. The Word was realized against most of
them, for they do not believe.
8. We placed shackles around their necks, up
to their chins, so they are stiff-necked.
9. And We placed a barrier in front of them,
and a barrier behind them, and We have en-
shrouded them, so they cannot see.
10. It is the same for them, whether you warn
them, or do not warn them—they will not be-
lieve.
11. You warn only him who follows the Mes-
sage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly.
So give him good news of forgiveness, and a
generous reward.
12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write
down what they have forwarded, and their
traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear
Record.
13. And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town—when the messengers
came to it.

14. We sent them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We reinforced them with
a third. They said, “We are messengers to you.”
15. They said, “You are nothing but humans like us, and the Gracious did not send down
anything; you are only lying.”

16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you.
17. And our only duty is clear communication.”
18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if
you do not give up, we will stone you, and a
painful punishment from us will befall you.”
5.
19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is
it because you were reminded? But you are an
extravagant people.”
20. Then a man came running from the remot-
est part of the city. He said, “O my people,
follow the messengers.
21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and
are themselves guided.
22. “And why should I not worship Him Who
created me, and to Whom you will be re-
turned?
23. Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If
the Merciful desires harm for me, their inter-
cession will not avail me at all, nor will they
save me.
24. In
that case, I would be completely lost.
I have believed in your Lord, so listen to
me.”
26. It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If
only my people knew.
27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made
me one of the honored.”
28. After him, We sent down no hosts from
heaven to his people; nor would We ever send
any down.
25.
29. It
was just one Cry, and they were stilled.
Alas for the servants. No messenger ever
came to them, but they ridiculed him.
31. Have they not considered how many gen-
erations We destroyed before them; and that
unto them they will not return?
32. All of them, every single one of them, will
be arraigned before Us.
33. And there is a sign for them in the dead
land: We give it life, and produce from it
grains from which they eat.
34. And We place in it gardens of palm-trees
and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.
35. That they may eat from its fruits, although
their hands did not make it. Will they not be
appreciative?
30.
16636. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
36. Glory be to Him who created all the pairs;
of what the earth produces, and of their own
selves, and of what they do not know.
37. Another sign for them is the night: We
strip the day out of it—and they are in dark-
ness.
38. And the sun runs towards its destination.
Such is the design of the Almighty, the All-
Knowing.
39. And the moon: We have disposed it in
phases, until it returns like the old twig.
40. The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is
the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an
orbit.
41. Another sign for them is that We carried
their offspring in the laden Ark.
42. And We created for them the like of it, in
which they ride.
43. If We will, We can drown them—with no
screaming to be heard from them, nor will
they be saved.
44. Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment
for a while.
45. Yet when it is said to them, “Beware of
what lies before you, and what lies behind
you, that you may receive mercy.”
46. Yet never came to them a sign of their
Lord’s signs, but they turned away from it.
47. And when it is said to them, “Spend of
what Allah has provided for you,” those who
disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we
feed someone whom Allah could feed, if He
so willed? You must be deeply misguided.”
48. And they say, “When will this promise be,
if you are truthful?”
49. All they can expect is a single blast, which
will seize them while they feud.
50. They will not be able to make a will, nor
will they return to their families.
51. The Trumpet will be blown, then behold,
they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.
52. They will say, “Woe to us! Who resurrected
us from our resting-place?” This is what the
Most Gracious had promised, and the mes-
sengers have spoken the truth.”
53. It will be but a single scream; and behold,
they will all be brought before Us.
54. On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the
least, and you will be recompensed only for
what you used to do.
55. The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day,
will be happily busy.
56. They and their spouses, in shades, reclin-
ing on couches.
57. They will have therein fruits. They will
have whatever they call for.
58. Peace—a saying from a Most Merciful
Lord.
59. But
step aside today, you criminals.
O Children of
Adam, that you shall not serve the devil? That
he is your sworn enemy?
61. And that you shall serve Me? This is a
straight path.
62. He has misled a great multitude of you. Did
you not understand?
60. Did I not covenant with you,
63. This
is Hellfire, which you were promised.
Roast in it today, because you persistently
disbelieved.
65. On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and
their hands will speak to Us, and their feet
will testify to everything they had done.
66. If We will, We can blind their eyes as they
rush towards the path—but how will they
see?
67. And if We will, We can cripple them in
their place; so they can neither move forward,
nor go back.
68. Whomever We grant old age, We reverse
his development. Do they not understand?
69. We did not teach him poetry, nor is it
proper for him. It is only a reminder, and a
Clear Quran.
70. That he may warn whoever is alive, and
prove the Word against the faithless.
64.
16737. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
Have they not seen that We created for
them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they
own?
72. And We subdued them for them. Some
they ride, and some they eat.
73. And they have in them other benefits, and
drinks. Will they not give thanks?
74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods
other than Allah, that perhaps they may be
helped.
75. They cannot help them, although they are
arrayed as troops for them.
76. So let their words not sadden you. We
know what they conceal, and what they re-
veal.
77. Does the human being not consider that
We created him from a seed? Yet he becomes
a fierce adversary.
78. And he produces arguments against Us,
and he forgets his own creation. He says,
“Who will revive the bones when they have
decayed?”
79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in-
stance will revive them. He has knowledge of
every creation.”
80. He who produced fuel for you from the
green trees, with which you kindle a fire.
81. Is not He who created the heavens and the
earth able to create the like of them? Cer-
tainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Crea-
tor.
82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to
say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.
83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the
dominion of everything, and to Him you will
be returned.
71.

11. Inquire of them, “Are they more difficult to

them from sticky clay.
8.
12. But
you wonder, and they ridicule.
And when reminded, they pay no atten-
tion.
13.
14. And
when they see a sign, they ridicule.
And they say, “This is nothing but plain
magic.
16. When we have died and become dust and
bones, shall we be resurrected?
15.
17. And
our ancestors of old?”
Say, “Yes indeed, and you will be totally
subdued.”
19. It will be a single nudge, and they will be
staring.
20. They will say, “Woe to us. This is the Day
of Judgment.”
21. “This is the Day of Separation which you
used to deny.
22. Gather those who did wrong, and their ma-
tes, and what they used to worship.
23. Besides Allah, and lead them to the way to
Hell.

In fact, on that Day, they will be submis-
sive.
27. They will come to one another, question-
ing one another.
28. They will say, “You used to come at us
from the right.”
29. They will say, “You yourselves were not be-
lievers.
30. We had no authority over you. You your-
selves were rebellious people.

83. Of
his kind was Abraham.
When he came to his Lord with a sound
heart.
85. He said to his father and his people, “What
are you worshiping?
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you
want?
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of
the Worlds?”
84.
88. Then
he took a glance at the stars.
89. And
said, “I am sick.”
90. But they turned their backs on him, and
went away.
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said,
“will you not eat?
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”
93. Then
he turned on them, striking with his
right hand.
94. And
they came running towards him.
95. He
said, “Do you worship what you carve?
When Allah created you, and what you
manufacture?”
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw
him into the furnace.”
98. They wished him ill, but We made them
the losers.
99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and
He will guide me.”
96.
100. “My
Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
So We gave him good news of a clement
boy.
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a
dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are
commanded; you will find me, Allah willing,
one of the steadfast.”

We reward the doers of good.
111. He
was one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him good news of Isaac, a
prophet, one of the righteous.
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But
among their descendants are some who are
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to
themselves.
112.
114. And
We blessed Moses and Aaron.
And We delivered them and their people
from the terrible disaster.
116. And We supported them, and so they were
the victors.
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
ture.
118. And We guided them upon the straight
path.

Elijah was one of the messengers.
124. He
said to his people, “Do you not fear?
Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best

126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your
ancestors.”
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they
will be brought forward.
