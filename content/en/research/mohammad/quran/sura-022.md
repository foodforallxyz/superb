1. O people, be conscious of your Lord. The quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing.

2. On the Day when you will see it: every nursing mother will discard her infant, and every
pregnant woman will abort her load, and you will see the people drunk, even though they
are not drunk—but the punishment of Allah is severe.

3. Among the people is he who argues about Allah without knowledge, and follows every
defiant devil.

4. It was decreed for him, that whoever follows him—he will misguide him, and lead him to
the torment of the Blaze.

5. O people! If you are in doubt about the Res-
urrection—We created you from dust, then
from a small drop, then from a clinging clot,
then from a lump of flesh, partly developed
and partly undeveloped. In order to clarify
things for you. And We settle in the wombs
whatever We will for a designated term, and
then We bring you out as infants, until you
reach your full strength. And some of you will
pass away, and some of you will be returned
to the vilest age, so that he may not know, af-
ter having known. And you see the earth still;
but when We send down water on it, it vi-
brates, and swells, and grows all kinds of
lovely pairs.
6. That is because Allah is the truth, and be-
cause He gives life to the dead, and because
He is Capable of everything.
7. And because the Hour is coming—there is
no doubt about it—and because Allah will
resurrect those in the graves.
8. And among the people is he who argues
about Allah without knowledge, or guidance,
or an enlightening scripture.

9. Turning aside in contempt, to lead away
from the path of Allah. He will have humilia-
tion in this world, and on the Day of Resur-
rection We will make him taste the agony of
burning.
10. That is for what your hands have advanced,
and because Allah is not unjust to the serv-
ants.
11. And among the people is he who worships
Allah on edge. When something good comes
his way, he is content with it. But when an or-
deal strikes him, he makes a turnaround. He
loses this world and the next. That is the ob-
vious loss.
12. He invokes, instead of Allah, what can nei-
ther harm him nor benefit him. That is the far
straying.
13. He invokes one whose harm is closer than
his benefit. What a miserable master. What a
miserable companion.
14. Allah will admit those who believe and do
righteous deeds into Gardens beneath which
rivers flow. Allah does whatever He wills.
15. Whoever thinks that Allah will not help
him in this life and in the Hereafter—let him
turn to heaven, then sever, and see if his cun-
ning eliminates what enrages him.
16. Thus We revealed it as clarifying signs, and
Allah guides whomever He wills.
17. Those who believe, and those who are Jew-
ish, and the Sabeans, and the Christians, and
the Zoroastrians, and the Polytheists—Allah
will judge between them on the Day of Res-
urrection. Allah is witness to all things.
18. Do you not realize that to Allah prostrates
everyone in the heavens and everyone on
earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the
stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and
the animals, and many of the people? But
many are justly deserving of punishment.
Whomever Allah shames, there is none to
honor him. Allah does whatever He wills.
19. Here are two adversaries feuding regarding
their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, gar-
ments of fire will be tailored for them, and


scalding water will be poured over their
heads.
20. Melting
21. And
their insides and their skins.
they will have maces of iron.
Whenever they try to escape the gloom,
they will be driven back to it: “Taste the suf-
fering of burning.”
23. But Allah will admit those who believe and
do good deeds into Gardens beneath which
rivers flow. They will be decorated therein
with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their
garments therein will be of silk.
24. They were guided to purity of speech. They
were guided to the path of the Most Praised.
25. As for those who disbelieve and repel from
Allah’s path and from the Sacred Mosque—
which We have designated for all mankind
equally, whether residing therein or passing
through—and seek to commit sacrilege
therein—We will make him taste of a painful
punishment.
26. We showed Abraham the location of the
House: “Do not associate anything with Me;
and purify My House for those who circle
around, and those who stand to pray, and
those who kneel and prostrate.”
27. And announce the pilgrimage to human-
ity. They will come to you on foot, and on
every transport. They will come from every
distant point.
28. That they may witness the benefits for
themselves, and celebrate the name of Allah
during the appointed days, for providing
them with the animal livestock. So eat from
it, and feed the unfortunate poor.
29. Then let them perform their acts of cleans-
ing, and fulfill their vows, and circle around
the Ancient House.
30. All that. Whoever venerates the sanctities
of Allah—it is good for him with his Lord. All
livestock are permitted to you, except what is
recited to you. So stay away from the abomi-
nation of idols, and stay away from perjury.
22.
31. Being true to Allah, without associating an-
ything with Him. Whoever associates any-
thing with Allah—it is as though he has fallen
from the sky, and is snatched by the birds, or
is swept away by the wind to a distant abyss.
32. So it is. Whoever venerates the sacraments
of Allah—it is from the piety of the hearts.
33. In them are benefits for you until a certain
time. Then their place is by the Ancient
House.
34. We have appointed a rite for every nation,
that they may commemorate Allah’s name
over the livestock He has provided for them.
Your God is One God, so to Him submit, and
announce good news to the humble.
35. Those whose hearts tremble when Allah is
mentioned, and those who endure what has
befallen them, and those who perform the
prayer and spend from what We have pro-
vided for them.
36. We have made the animal offerings em-
blems of Allah for you. In them is goodness
for you. So pronounce Allah’s name upon
them as they line up. Then, when they have
fallen on their sides, eat of them and feed the
contented and the beggar. Thus We have sub-
jected them to you, that you may be thankful.
37. Neither their flesh, nor their blood, ever
reaches Allah. What reaches Him is the right-
eousness from you. Thus He subdued them
to you, that you may glorify Allah for guiding
you. And give good news to the charitable.
38. Allah defends those who believe. Allah
does not love any ungrateful traitor.
39. Permission is given to those who are
fought against, and Allah is Able to give them
victory.
40. Those who were unjustly evicted from
their homes, merely for saying, “Our Lord is
Allah.” Were it not that Allah repels people
by means of others: monasteries, churches,
synagogues, and mosques—where the name
of Allah is mentioned much—would have
been demolished. Allah supports whoever
supports Him. Allah is Strong and Mighty.
12422. THE PILGRIMAGE (al-Hajj)
41. Those who, when We empower them in the
land, observe the prayer, and give regular
charity, and command what is right, and for-
bid what is wrong. To Allah belongs the out-
come of events.
42. If they deny you—before them the people
of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood also denied.
43. And the people of Abraham, and the peo-
ple of Lot.
44. And the inhabitants of Median. And Moses
was denied. Then I reprieved those who dis-
believed, but then I seized them. So how was
My rejection?
45. How many a town have We destroyed
while it was doing wrong? They lie in ruins;
with stilled wells, and lofty mansions.
46. Have they not journeyed in the land, and
had minds to reason with, or ears to listen
with? It is not the eyes that go blind, but it is
the hearts, within the chests, that go blind.
47. And they ask you to hasten the punish-
ment. But Allah never breaks His promise. A
day with your Lord is like a thousand years of
your count.
48. How many a town have I reprieved, alt-
hough it was unjust? Then I seized it. To Me
is the destination.
49. Say, “O people, I am only a plain warner to
you.”
50. Those who believe and work righteous-
ness—for them is forgiveness and a generous
provision.
51. But those who strive against Our revela-
tions—these are the inmates of Hell.
52. We never sent a messenger before you, or
a prophet, but when he had a desire Satan in-
terfered in his wishes. But Allah nullifies what
Satan interjects, and Allah affirms His revela-
tions. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.
53. In order to make Satan’s suggestions a trial
for those whose hearts are diseased, and those
whose hearts are hardened. The wrongdoers
are in profound discord.
And so that those endowed with
knowledge may know that it is the truth from
your Lord, and so believe in it, and their
hearts soften to it. Allah guides those who be-
lieve to a straight path.
55. Those who disbelieve will continue to be
hesitant about it, until the Hour comes upon
them suddenly, or there comes to them the
torment of a desolate Day.
56. Sovereignty on that Day belongs to Allah;
He will judge between them. Those who be-
lieve and do good deeds will be in the Gar-
dens of Bliss.
57. But those who disbelieve and reject Our
revelations—these will have a humiliating
punishment.
58. Those who emigrate in Allah’s cause, then
get killed, or die, Allah will provide them with
fine provisions. Allah is the Best of Providers.
59. He will admit them an admittance that will
please them. Allah is Knowing and Clement.
60. That is so! Whoever retaliates similarly to
the affliction he was made to suffer, and then
he is wronged again, Allah will definitely as-
sist him. Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
61. That is because Allah merges the night into
the day, and He merges the day into the night,
and because Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
62. That is because Allah is the Reality, and
what they invoke besides Him is vanity, and
because Allah is the Sublime, the Grand.
63. Do you not see that Allah sends down wa-
ter from the sky, and the land becomes green?
Allah is Kind and Aware.
64. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and everything on earth. Allah is the Rich, the
Praised.
65. Do you not see that Allah made everything
on earth subservient to you? How the ships
sail at sea by His command? That He holds
up the sky lest it falls on earth—except by His
permission? Allah is Gracious towards the
people, Most Merciful.
54.
12523. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
66. And it is He who gives you life, then makes
you die, then revives you. The human being
is unappreciative.
67. For every congregation We have appointed
acts of devotion, which they observe. So do
not let them dispute with you in this matter.
And invite to your Lord; you are upon a
straight guidance.
68. But if they dispute with you, say, “Allah is
fully aware of what you do.”
69. Allah will judge between you on the Day of
Resurrection regarding what you disagree
about.
70. Do you not know that Allah knows every-
thing in the heavens and the earth? This is in
a book. That is easy for Allah.
71. Yet they worship, besides Allah, things for
which He sent down no warrant, and what
they have no knowledge of. There is no savior
for the transgressors.
72. And when Our Clear Verses are recited to
them, you will recognize disgust on the faces
of those who disbelieve. They nearly assault
those who recite to them Our Verses. Say,
“Shall I inform you of something worse than
that? The Fire! Allah has promised it to those
who disbelieve. And what a wretched out-
come!”
73. O people! A parable is presented, so listen
to it: Those you invoke besides Allah will
never create a fly, even if they banded to-
gether for that purpose. And if the fly steals
anything from them, they cannot recover it
from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pur-
sued.
74. They do not value Allah as He should be
valued. Allah is Strong and Powerful.
75. Allah chooses messengers from among the
angels, and from among the people. Allah is
Hearing and Seeing.
76. He knows what is before them, and what is
behind them. To Allah all matters are re-
ferred.
O you who believe! Kneel, and prostrate,
and worship your Lord, and do good deeds,
so that you may succeed.
78. And strive for Allah, with the striving due
to Him. He has chosen you, and has not bur-
dened you in religion—the faith of your fa-
ther Abraham. It is he who named you Mus-
lims before, and in this. So that the Messen-
ger may be a witness over you, and you may
be witnesses over the people. So pray regu-
larly, and give regular charity, and cleave to
Allah. He is your Protector. What an excel-
lent Protector, and what an excellent Helper.
77.
23. THE BELIEVERS
(al-Mu’minun)

1. Successful
are the believers.
2. Those who are humble in their prayers.
3. Those who avoid nonsense.
4. Those who work for charity.
5. Those
who safeguard their chastity.
from their spouses, or their depend-
ents—for then they are free from blame.
7. But whoever seeks anything beyond that—
these are the transgressors.
8. Those who are faithful to their trusts and
pledges.
6. Except
9. Those
who safeguard their prayers.
10. These
are the inheritors.
Who will inherit Paradise, wherein they
will dwell forever.
11.
12. We
created man from an extract of clay.
We made him a seed, in a secure re-
pository.
14. Then We developed the seed into a clot.
Then We developed the clot into a lump.
Then We developed the lump into bones.
Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then
We produced it into another creature. Most
Blessed is Allah, the Best of Creators.
13. Then
12623. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
15. Then,
after that, you will die.
16. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will
be resurrected.
17. We created above you seven pathways, and
We are never heedless of the creation.
18. And We sent down water from the sky in
proper quantity, and settled it in the ground,
and We are Able to take it away.
19. With it We produce for you gardens of
palms and vines, yielding abundant fruit for
you to eat.
20. And a tree springing out of Mount Sinai,
producing oil, and seasoning for those who
eat.
21. And there is a lesson for you in livestock:
We give you to drink from what is in their
bellies, and you have many benefits in them,
and from them you eat.
22. And on them, and on the ships, you are
transported.
23. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O
my people, worship Allah, you have no deity
other than Him. Will you not take heed?”
24. But the notables of his people, who disbe-
lieved, said, “This is nothing but a human like
you, who wants to gain superiority over you.
Had Allah willed, He would have sent down
angels. We never heard of this from our fore-
fathers of old.
25. He is nothing but a man possessed. Just ig-
nore him for a while.”
26. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have
rejected me.”
27. So We inspired him: “Build the Ark under
Our observation and by Our inspiration. And
when Our decree comes to pass, and the oven
boils over, load into it two pairs of every kind,
together with your family, except those of
them against whom the word has already
been pronounced. And do not speak to me
concerning those who did wrong; for they are
to be drowned.”
28. Then, when you and those with you are set-
tled in the Ark, say, “Praise be to Allah, who
has saved us from the wrongdoing people.”
29. And say, “My Lord, land me with a blessed
landing, as you are the best of transporters.”
30. Surely in that are signs. We are always test-
ing.
31. Then, after them, We established another
generation.
32. And We sent among them a messenger
from themselves: “Serve Allah. You have no
god other than Him. Will you not be cau-
tious?”
33. But the dignitaries of his people, those who
disbelieved and denied the meeting of the
Hereafter, and We had indulged them in the
present life, said, “This is nothing but a hu-
man like you; he eats what you eat, and he
drinks what you drink.
34. If you obey a human being like yourselves,
then you will be losers.
35. Does he promise you that when you have
died and become dust and bones, you will be
brought out?
36. Farfetched, farfetched is what you are
promised.
37. There is nothing but our life in this world.
We die, and we live, and we are not resur-
rected.
38. He is nothing but a man, making up lies
about Allah. We have no faith in him.”
39. He said, “My Lord, help me, for they have
rejected me.”
40. He said, “Soon they will be filled with re-
gret.”
41. Then the Blast struck them, justifiably, and
We turned them into scum. So away with the
wicked people.
42. Then, after them, We raised other genera-
tions.
43. No nation can advance its time, nor can
they postpone it.
12723. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
44. Then We sent Our messengers in succes-
sion. Every time a messenger came to his
community, they called him a liar. So We
made them follow one another, and made
them history. So away with a people who do
not believe.
45. Then We sent Moses and his brother Aa-
ron, with Our signs and a clear authority.
46. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they turned
arrogant. They were oppressive people.
47. They said, “Are we to believe in two mor-
tals like us, and their people are our slaves?”
48. So they called them liars, and thus were
among those destroyed.
49. And We gave Moses the Scripture, that
they may be guided.
50. And We made Mary’s son and his mother
a sign, and We sheltered them on high
ground with security and flowing springs.
51. O messengers, eat of the good things, and
act with integrity. I am aware of what you do.
52. This nation of yours is one nation, and I
am your Lord, so fear Me.
53. But they tore themselves into sects; each
party happy with what they have.
54. So leave them in their bewilderment until
a time.
55. Do they assume that, in furnishing them
with wealth and children.
56. We race to give them the good things? In
fact, they have no idea.
57. Those who, from awe of their Lord, are
fearful.
58. And those who believe in their Lord’s
Verses.
59. And those who associate no partners with
their Lord.
60. And those who give what they give, while
their hearts quake, knowing that to their Lord
they will return.
61. It is they who race towards goodness. It is
they who will reach it first.
We never burden any soul beyond its ca-
pacity. And with Us is a record that tells the
truth, and they will not be wronged.
63. But their hearts are puzzled because of this;
and they have deeds that do not conform to
this, which they continue to perpetrate.
64. Until, when We seize the decadent among
them with torment, they begin to groan.
65. Do not groan today. You will receive no
help from Us.
66. My Verses were recited to you, but you
turned back on your heels.
67. Arrogant towards it—talked nonsense
about it—disregarded it.
68. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has
there come to them what came not to their
forefathers of old?
69. Or is it that they did not recognize their
messenger, so they are denying him?
70. Or do they say, “He is possessed?” In fact,
he brought them the truth, but most of them
hate the truth.
71. If the truth conformed to their desires, the
heavens, the earth, and everyone in them
would have gone to ruin. In fact, We have
given them their message, but they keep
avoiding their message.
72. Or are you asking them for a payment? The
revenue from your Lord is better, and He is
the Best of providers.
62.
73. You
are inviting them to a straight path.
those who do not believe in the Here-
after are swerving from the path.
75. Even if We had mercy on them, and re-
lieved their problems, they would still blindly
persist in their defiance.
76. We have already gripped them with suffer-
ing, but they did not surrender to their Lord,
nor did they humble themselves.
77. Until, when We have opened before them
a gate of intense agony, at once they will des-
pair.
74. But
12823. THE BELIEVERS (al-Mu’minun)
78. It is He who produced for you the hearing,
and the eyesight, and the feelings. But little
gratitude you show.
79. And it is He who multiplied you on earth,
and to Him you will be gathered.
80. And it is He who gives life and brings
death, and to Him is the alternation of night
and day. Do you not understand?
81. But they say the like of what the ancients
said.
82. They say, “After we have died, and become
dust and bones, will we be resurrected?
83. We were promised this before—we and
our ancestors—these are nothing but legends
of the ancients.”
84. Say, “To whom does the earth belong, and
everyone in it, if you happen to know?”
85. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you
not reflect?”
86. Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens,
and Lord of the Splendid Throne?”
87. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Will you
not become righteous?”
88. Say, “In whose hand is the dominion of all
things, and He protects and cannot be pro-
tected from, if you happen to know?”
89. They will say, “To Allah.” Say, “Then are
you bewitched?”
90. In fact, We have given them the truth, and
they are liars.
91. Allah has never begotten a son, nor is there
any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god
would have taken away what it has created,
and some of them would have gained su-
premacy over others. Glory be to Allah, far
beyond what they describe.
92. The Knower of the hidden and the mani-
fest. He is exalted, far above what they asso-
ciate.
93. Say, “My Lord, if You would show me what
they are promised.
94. My Lord, do not place me among the
wicked people.”
We are surely Able to show you what We
promise them.
96. Repel evil by what is better. We are aware
of what they describe.
97. And say, “My Lord, I seek refuge with You
from the urgings of the devils.
98. And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest
they become present.”
99. Until, when death comes to one of them,
he says, “My Lord, send me back.
100. That I may do right in what I have ne-
glected.” By no means! It is just a word that
he utters. And behind them is a barrier, until
the Day they are resurrected.
101. When the Horn is blown, no relations be-
tween them will exist on that Day, and they
will not ask after one another.
102. Those whose scales are heavy—those are
the successful.
103. But those whose scales are light—those are
they who have lost their souls; in Hell they
will dwell forever.
104. The Fire lashes their faces, and therein
they grimace.
105. “Were not My revelations recited to you,
and you kept on rejecting them?”
106. They will say, “Our Lord, our wretched-
ness prevailed over us, and we were a people
astray.
107. Our Lord! Bring us out of this. If we ever
returned, we would truly be evil.”
108. He will say, “Be despised therein, and do
not speak to Me.
109. There was a group of My servants who
would say, `Our Lord, we have believed, so
forgive us, and have mercy on us; You are the
Best of the merciful.'
110. But you made them a target of ridicule,
until they made you forget My remembrance;
and you used to laugh at them.
111. Today, I have rewarded them for their en-
durance. They are the ones who are the tri-
umphant.”
95.
12924. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
112. He
will say, “How many years did you re-
main on earth?”
113. They will say, “We remained a day, or part
of a day; but ask those who keep count.”
114. He will say, “You remained only for a little
while, if you only knew.
115. Did you think that We created you in vain,
and that to Us you will not be returned?”
116. So Exalted is Allah, the Ruler, the Real.
There is no god except He, the Lord of the
Noble Throne.
117. Whoever invokes another god besides Al-
lah—he has no proof thereof—his reckoning
rests with his Lord. The disbelievers will not
succeed.
118. And say, “My Lord, forgive and have
mercy, for You are the Best of the merciful.”
24. THE LIGHT
(an-Nur)

1. A
chapter that We have revealed, and made
obligatory, and revealed in it clear Verses,
that you may take heed.
2. The adulteress and the adulterer—whip
each one of them a hundred lashes, and let no
pity towards them overcome you regarding
Allah’s Law, if you believe in Allah and the
Last Day. And let a group of believers witness
their punishment.
3. The adulterer shall marry none but an adul-
teress or an idolatress; and the adulteress
shall marry none but an adulterer or an idol-
ater. That has been prohibited for the believ-
ers.
4. Those who accuse chaste women, then can-
not bring four witnesses, whip them eighty
lashes, and do not ever accept their testi-
mony. For these are the immoral.
5. Except for those who repent afterwards, and
reform; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
6. As for those who accuse their own spouses,
but have no witnesses except themselves, the
testimony of one of them is equivalent to four
testimonies, if he swears by Allah that he is
truthful.
7. And the fifth time, that Allah’s curse be
upon him, if he is a liar.
8. But punishment shall be averted from her,
if she swears four times by Allah, that he is a
liar.
9. And the fifth time, that Allah’s wrath be
upon her, if he is truthful.
10. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and
His mercy, and that Allah is Conciliatory and
Wise.
11. Those who perpetrated the slander are a
band of you. Do not consider it bad for you,
but it is good for you. Each person among
them bears his share in the sin. As for him
who played the major role—for him is a ter-
rible punishment.
12. Why, when you heard about it, the believ-
ing men and women did not think well of one
another, and say, “This is an obvious lie”?
13. Why did they not bring four witnesses to
testify to it? If they fail to bring the witnesses,
then in Allah’s sight, they are liars.
14. Were it not for Allah’s favor upon you, and
His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter,
you would have suffered a great punishment
for what you have ventured into.
15. When you rumored it with your tongues,
and spoke with your mouths what you had no
knowledge of, and you considered it trivial;
but according to Allah, it is serious.
16. When you heard it, you should have said,
“It is not for us to repeat this. By Your glory,
this is a serious slander.”
17. Allah cautions you never to return to the
like of it, if you are believers.
18. Allah explains the Verses to you. Allah is
Knowing and Wise.
19. Those who love to see immorality spread
among the believers—for them is a painful
13024. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
punishment, in this life and in the Hereafter.
Allah knows, and you do not know.
20. Were it not for Allah’s grace upon you, and
His mercy, and that Allah is Clement and
Merciful.
21. O you who believe! Do not follow Satan’s
footsteps. Whoever follows Satan’s foot-
steps—he advocates obscenity and immoral-
ity. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you,
and His mercy, not one of you would have
been pure, ever. But Allah purifies whomever
He wills. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
22. Those of you who have affluence and
means should not refuse to give to the rela-
tives, and the needy, and the emigrants for
the sake of Allah. And let them pardon, and
let them overlook. Do you not love for Allah
to pardon you? Allah is All-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.
23. Those who slander honorable, innocent,
believing women are cursed in this life and in
the Hereafter. They will have a terrible pun-
ishment.
24. On the Day when their tongues, and their
hands, and their feet will testify against them
regarding what they used to do.
25. On that Day, Allah will pay them their ac-
count in full, and they will know that Allah is
the Evident Reality.
26. Bad women are for bad men, and bad men
are for bad women, and good women are for
good men, and good men are for good
women. Those are acquitted of what they say.
There is forgiveness for them, and a generous
provision.
27. O you who believe! Do not enter homes
other than your own, until you have asked
permission and greeted their occupants. That
is better for you, that you may be aware.
28. And if you find no one in them, do not en-
ter them until you are given permission. And
if it is said to you, “Turn back,” then turn
back. That is more proper for you. Allah is
aware of what you do.
29. There is no blame on you for entering un-
inhabited houses, in which are belongings of
yours. Allah knows what you reveal and what
you conceal.
30. Tell the believing men to restrain their
looks, and to guard their privates. That is
purer for them. Allah is cognizant of what
they do.
31. And tell the believing women to restrain
their looks, and to guard their privates, and
not display their beauty except what is appar-
ent thereof, and to draw their coverings over
their breasts, and not expose their beauty ex-
cept to their husbands, their fathers, their
husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands'
sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their
sisters' sons, their women, what their right
hands possess, their male attendants who
have no sexual desires, or children who are
not yet aware of the nakedness of women.
And they should not strike their feet to draw
attention to their hidden beauty. And repent
to Allah, all of you believers, so that you may
succeed.
32. And wed the singles among you, and those
who are fit among your servants and maids.
If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from
His bounty. Allah is All-Encompassing, All-
Knowing.
33. And let those who do not find the means to
marry abstain, until Allah enriches them
from His bounty. If any of your servants wish
to be freed, grant them their wish, if you rec-
ognize some good in them. And give them of
Allah’s wealth which he has given you. And
do not compel your girls to prostitution,
seeking the materials of this life, if they desire
to remain chaste. Should anyone compel
them—after their compulsion, Allah is For-
giving and Merciful.
34. We have sent down to you clarifying reve-
lations, and examples of those who passed on
before you, and advice for the righteous.
35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and the
earth. The allegory of His light is that of a pil-
lar on which is a lamp. The lamp is within a
glass. The glass is like a brilliant planet, fueled
13124. THE LIGHT (an-Nur)
by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern
nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate,
even if no fire has touched it. Light upon
Light. Allah guides to His light whomever He
wills. Allah thus cites the parables for the peo-
ple. Allah is cognizant of everything.
36. In houses which Allah has permitted to be
raised, and His name is celebrated therein.
He is glorified therein, morning and evening.
37. By men who neither trading nor commerce
distracts them from Allah’s remembrance,
and from performing the prayers, and from
giving alms. They fear a Day when hearts and
sights are overturned.
38. Allah will reward them according to the
best of what they did, and He will increase
them from His bounty. Allah provides for
whomever He wills without reckoning.
39. As for those who disbelieve, their works are
like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty assumes
it is to be water. Until, when he has reached
it, he finds it to be nothing, but there he finds
Allah, Who settles his account in full. Allah is
swift in reckoning.
40. Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, cov-
ered by waves, above which are waves, above
which is fog. Darkness upon darkness. If he
brings out his hand, he will hardly see it. He
to whom Allah has not granted a light has no
light.
41. Do you not realize that Allah is glorified by
whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and
even by the birds in formation? Each knows
its prayer and its manner of praise. Allah
knows well what they do.
42. To Allah belongs the dominion of the
heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the ul-
timate return.
43. Have you not seen how Allah propels the
clouds, then brings them together, then piles
them into a heap, and you see rain drops
emerging from its midst? How He brings
down loads of hail from the sky, striking with
it whomever He wills, and diverting it from
whomever He wills? The flash of its lighten-
ing almost snatches the sight away.
Allah alternates the night and the day. In
that is a lesson for those who have insight.
45. Allah created every living creature from
water. Some of them crawl on their bellies,
and some walk on two feet, and others walk
on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Al-
lah is Capable of everything.
46. We sent down enlightening revelations,
and Allah guides whomever He wills to a
straight path.
47. And they say, “We have believed in Allah
and the Messenger, and we obey,” but some
of them turn away afterwards. These are not
believers.
48. And when they are called to Allah and His
Messenger, in order to judge between them,
some of them refuse.
49. But if justice is on their side, they accept it
willingly.
50. Is there sickness in their hearts? Or are they
suspicious? Or do they fear that Allah may do
them injustice? Or His Messenger? In fact,
they themselves are the unjust.
51. The response of the believers, when they
are called to Allah and His Messenger in or-
der to judge between them, is to say, “We
hear and we obey.” These are the successful.
52. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger,
and fears Allah, and is conscious of Him—
these are the winners.
53. And they swear by Allah with their solemn
oaths, that if you commanded them, they
would mobilize. Say, “Do not swear. Obedi-
ence will be recognized. Allah is experienced
with what you do.”
54. Say, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.”
But if they turn away, then he is responsible
for his obligations, and you are responsible
for your obligations. And if you obey him,
you will be guided. It is only incumbent on
the Messenger to deliver the Clarifying Mes-
sage.
55. Allah has promised those of you who be-
lieve and do righteous deeds, that He will
make them successors on earth, as He made
44.
13225. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
those before them successors, and He will es-
tablish for them their religion—which He has
approved for them—and He will substitute
security in place of their fear. They worship
Me, never associating anything with Me. But
whoever disbelieves after that—these are the
sinners.
56. Pray regularly, and give regular charity,
and obey the Messenger, so that you may re-
ceive mercy.
57. Never think that those who disbelieve can
escape on earth. Their place is the Fire; a mis-
erable destination.
58. O you who believe! Permission must be re-
quested by your servants and those of you
who have not reached puberty. On three oc-
casions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon
when you change your clothes, and after the
Evening Prayer. These are three occasions of
privacy for you. At other times, it is not
wrong for you or them to intermingle with
one another. Allah thus clarifies the revela-
tions for you. Allah is Knowledgeable and
Wise.
59. When the children among you reach pu-
berty, they must ask permission, as those be-
fore them asked permission. Allah thus clari-
fies His revelations for you. Allah is Knowl-
edgeable and Wise.
60. Women past the age of childbearing, who
have no desire for marriage, commit no
wrong by taking off their outer clothing, pro-
vided they do not flaunt their finery. But to
maintain modesty is better for them. Allah is
Hearing and Knowing.
61. There is no blame on the blind, nor any
blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick,
nor on yourselves for eating at your homes,
or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’
homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sis-
ters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal
uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts,
or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the
homes of your maternal aunts, or those
whose keys you own, or the homes of your
friends. You commit no wrong by eating to-
gether or separately. But when you enter any
home, greet one another with a greeting from
Allah, blessed and good. Allah thus explains
the revelations for you, so that you may un-
derstand.
62. The believers are those who believe in Al-
lah and His Messenger, and when they are
with him for a matter of common interest,
they do not leave until they have asked him
for permission. Those who ask your permis-
sion are those who believe in Allah and His
Messenger. So when they ask your permis-
sion to attend to some affair of theirs, give
permission to any of them you wish, and ask
Allah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.
63. Do not address the Messenger in the same
manner you address one another. Allah
knows those of you who slip away using
flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his
orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or
a painful punishment befalls them.
64. Surely, to Allah belongs everything in the
heavens and the earth. He knows what you
are about. And on the Day they are returned
to Him, He will inform them of what they
did. Allah has full knowledge of all things.
25. THE CRITERION
(al-Furqan)

Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion
upon His servant, to be a warning to human-
ity.
2. He to whom belongs the kingdom of the
heavens and the earth, who took to Himself
no son, who never had a partner in His king-
ship; who created everything and determined
its measure.
3. And yet, instead of Him, they produce for
themselves gods that create nothing, but are
themselves created; that have no power to
harm or benefit themselves; and no power
over life, death, or resurrection.
1.
13325. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
4. Those who disbelieve say, “This is nothing
but a lie that he made up, and others have
helped him at it.” They have committed an
injustice and a perjury.
5. And they say, “Tales of the ancients; he
wrote them down; they are dictated to him
morning and evening.”
6. Say, “It was revealed by He who knows the
Secret in the heavens and the earth. He is al-
ways Forgiving and Merciful.”
7. And they say, “What sort of messenger is
this, who eats food, and walks in the market-
places? If only an angel was sent down with
him, to be alongside him a warner.”
8. Or, “If only a treasure was dropped on
him.” Or, “If only he had a garden from
which he eats.” The evildoers also say, “You
are following but a man under spell.”
9. Look how they invent examples for you.
They have gone astray, and cannot find a
way.
10. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can provide
you with better than that—gardens beneath
which rivers flow—and He will give you pal-
aces.
11. In fact, they have denied the Hour, and We
have prepared for those who deny the Hour a
Blaze.
12. When it sees them from a distant place,
they will hear it raging and roaring.
13. And when they are thrown into it, into a
tight place, shackled, they will plead there for
death.
14. “Do not plead for one death today, but
plead for a great many deaths.”
15. Say, “Is this better, or the Garden of Eter-
nity promised to the righteous? It is for them
a reward and a destination.
16. They will have therein whatever they de-
sire, forever. That is upon your Lord a bind-
ing promise.
17. On the Day when He gathers them, and
what they worshiped besides Allah, He will
say, “Was it you who misled these servants of
Mine, or was it they who lost the way?”
18. They will say, “Glory be to You. It was not
for us to take any lords besides You. But you
gave them enjoyments, and their ancestors,
until they forgot the Message, and became ru-
ined people.”
19. They have denied you because of what you
say; so you can neither avert, nor help. Who-
ever among you commits injustice, We will
make him taste a grievous punishment.
20. We never sent any messengers before you,
but they ate food and walked in the market-
places. And We made some of you tempters
for one another—will you be patient? Your
Lord is always Observing.
21. Those who do not expect to meet Us say,
“If only the angels were sent down to us, or
we could see our Lord.” They have grown ar-
rogant within themselves, and have become
excessively defiant.
22. On the Day when they see the angels—
there will be no good news for sinners on that
Day; and they will say, “A protective refuge.”
23. We will proceed to the works they did, and
will turn them into scattered dust.
24. The companions of Paradise on that Day
will be better lodged, and more fairly accom-
modated.
25. The Day when the sky is cleft with clouds,
and the angels are sent down in streams.
26. On that Day, true sovereignty will belong
to the Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day
for the disbelievers.
27. On that Day, the wrongdoer will bite his
hands, and say, “If only I had followed the
way with the Messenger.
28. Oh, woe to me; I wish I never took so-and-
so for a friend.
29. He led me away from the Message after it
had come to me; for Satan has always been a
betrayer of man.”
30. And the Messenger will say, “My Lord, my
people have abandoned this Quran.”
13425. THE CRITERION (al-Furqan)
31. Likewise, to every prophet We assign ene-
mies from among the wicked. But your Lord
suffices as a Guide and Savior.
32. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was the
Quran not revealed to him at once?” Thus in
order to strengthen your heart thereby, and
We revealed it in stages.
33. Whatever argument they come to you
with, We provide you with the truth, and a
better exposition.
34. Those who are herded into Hell on their
faces—those are in a worse position, and fur-
ther astray from the way.
35. We gave Moses the Scripture, and ap-
pointed his brother Aaron as his assistant.
36. We said, “Go to the people who rejected
Our signs,” and We destroyed them com-
pletely.
37. And the people of Noah: when they re-
jected the messengers, We drowned them,
and made them a lesson for mankind. We
have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful
retribution.
38. And Aad, and Thamood, and the inhabit-
ants of Arras, and many generations in be-
tween.
39. To each We presented the parables; and
each We devastated utterly.
40. And they came upon the city that was
drenched by the terrible rain. Did they not
see it? But they do not expect resurrection.
41. And when they see you, they take you for
nothing but mockery: “Is this the one Allah
sent as a messenger?”
42. “He nearly led us away from our gods, had
we not patiently adhered to them.” But they
will know, when they witness the torment,
who is further away from the way.
43. Have you seen him who chose his desire as
his god? Would you be an agent for him?
44. Or do you assume that most of them hear
or understand? They are just like cattle, but
even more errant in their way.
45. Do you not see how your Lord extends the
shadow? Had He willed, He could have made
it still. And We made the sun a pointer to it.
46. Then We withdraw it towards Us gradu-
ally.
47. And it is He who made the night a covering
for you, and sleep for rest; and He made the
day a revival.
48. And it is He who sends the winds, bringing
advance news of His mercy; and We send
down from the sky pure water.
49. To revive dead lands thereby, and to pro-
vide drink for the multitude of animals and
humans We created.
50. We have circulated it among them, that
they may reflect, but most people persist in
thanklessness.
51. Had We willed, We could have sent to
every town a warner.
52. So do not obey the disbelievers, but strive
against them with it, a mighty struggle.
53. And it is He who merged the two seas; this
one fresh and sweet, and that one salty and
bitter; and He placed between them a barrier,
and an impassable boundary.
54. And it is He who, from fluid, created the
human being. Then He made relationships
through marriage and mating. Your Lord is
Omnipotent.
55. And yet, instead of Allah, they serve what
neither profits them nor harms them. The
disbeliever has always turned his back on his
Lord.
56. We sent you only as a herald of good news
and a warner.
57. Say, “I ask of you no payment for this—
only that whoever wills may take a path to his
Lord.”
58. And put your trust in the Living, the One
who never dies; and celebrate His praise. He
suffices as the All-Informed Knower of the
faults of His creatures.
59. He who created the heavens and the earth
and everything between them in six days,
13526. THE POETS (ash-Shu’ara’)
then settled on the Throne. The Most Merci-
ful. Ask about Him a well-informed.
60. And when it is said to them, “Bow down to
the Merciful,” they say, “And what is the
Merciful? Are we to bow down to whatever
you command us?” And it increases their
aversion.
61. Blessed is He who placed constellations in
the sky, and placed in it a lamp, and an illu-
minating moon.
62. And it is He who made the night and the
day alternate—for whoever desires to reflect,
or desires to show gratitude.
63. The servants of the Merciful are those who
walk the earth in humility, and when the ig-
norant address them, they say, “Peace.”
64. And those who pass the night prostrating
themselves to their Lord and standing up.
65. And those who say, ‘‘Our Lord, avert from
us the suffering of Hell, for its suffering is
continuous.
66. It is indeed a miserable residence and des-
tination.”
67. And those who, when they spend, are nei-
ther wasteful nor stingy, but choose a middle
course between that.
68. And those who do not implore besides Al-
lah any other god, and do not kill the soul
which Allah has made sacred—except in the
pursuit of justice—and do not commit adul-
tery. Whoever does that will face penalties.
69. The punishment will be doubled for him
on the Day of Resurrection, and he will dwell
therein in humiliation forever.
70. Except for those who repent, and believe,
and do good deeds. These—Allah will replace
their bad deeds with good deeds. Allah is ever
Forgiving and Merciful.
71. Whoever repents and acts righteously—
has inclined towards Allah with repentance.
72. And those who do not bear false witness;
and when they come across indecencies, they
pass by with dignity.
73. And those who, when reminded of the rev-
elations of their Lord, do not fall before them
deaf and blind.
74. And those who say, “Our Lord, grant us de-
light in our spouses and our children, and
make us a good example for the righteous.”
75. Those will be awarded the Chamber for
their patience, and will be greeted therein
with greetings and peace.
76. Abiding therein forever—it is an excellent
residence and destination.
77. Say, “What are you to my Lord without
your prayers? You have denied the truth, and
the inevitable will happen.”

because they do not become believers.
4. If We will, We can send down upon them a
sign from heaven, at which their necks will
stay bent in humility.
5. No fresh reminder comes to them from the
Most Merciful, but they turn their backs at it.
6. They have denied the truth, but soon will

culed.
7. Have they not seen the earth, and how
many beautiful pairs We produced therein?
8. Surely in this is a sign, but most of them are

said, “Did we not raise you among us as

19. And you committed that deed you com-
mitted, and you were ungrateful.”
20. He said, “I did it then, when I was of those

my Lord gave me wisdom, and made me one
of the messengers.
22. Is that the favor you taunt me with, alt-
hough you have enslaved the Children of Is-
rael?”
23. Pharaoh said, “And what is the Lord of the
Worlds?”
24. He said, “The Lord of the heavens and the
earth, and everything between them, if you
are aware.”
25. He said to those around him, “Do you not
hear?”
26. He said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your
ancestors of old.”
27. He said, “This messenger of yours, who is
sent to you, is crazy.”
28. He said, “Lord of the East and the West,

stand.”

41. When the magicians arrived, they said to
Pharaoh, “Is there a reward for us, if we are

favored.”
43. Moses said to them, “Present what you in-
tend to present.”

would not have believed in it.
200. Thus We make it pass through the hearts

1. Ta, Seen. These are the Signs of the Quran—
a book that makes things clear.
2. Guidance
and good news for the believers.
Those who observe the prayers, and give
charity regularly, and are certain of the Here-
after.
4. As for those who do not believe in the Here-
after: We made their deeds appear good to
them, so they wander aimlessly.
5. It is they who will receive the grievous pun-
ishment—and in the Hereafter they will be
the greatest losers.
6. You are receiving the Quran from an All-
Wise, All-Knowing.
7. When Moses said to his family, “I have
glimpsed a fire. I will bring you some news
from it; or bring you a firebrand, that you
may warm yourselves.”
3.
14127. THE ANT (an-Naml)
Then, when he reached it, he was called:
“Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He
who is around it, and glorified be Allah, Lord
of the Worlds.
9. O Moses, it is I, Allah, the Almighty, the
Wise.
10. Throw down your staff.” But when he saw
it quivering, as though it were a demon, he
turned around not looking back. “O Moses,
do not fear; the messengers do not fear in My
presence.
11. But whoever has done wrong, and then
substituted goodness in place of evil. I am
Forgiving and Merciful.
12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it
will come out white, without blemish—
among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his peo-
ple, for they are immoral people.”
13. Yet when Our enlightening signs came to
them, they said, “This is obvious witchcraft.”
14. And they rejected them, although their
souls were certain of them, out of wickedness
and pride. So see how the outcome was for
the mischief-makers.
15. And We gave David and Solomon
knowledge. They said, “Praise Allah, who has
favored us over many of His believing serv-
ants.”
16. And Solomon succeeded David. He said,
“O people, we were taught the language of
birds, and we were given from everything.
This is indeed a real blessing.”
17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized
his troops of sprites, and men, and birds—all
held in strict order.
18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of
Ants, an ant said, “O ants! Go into your nests,
lest Solomon and his troops crush you with-
out noticing.”
19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and
said, “My Lord, direct me to be thankful for
the blessings you have bestowed upon me
and upon my parents, and to do good works
that please You. And admit me, by Your
8.
grace, into the company of Your virtuous
servants.”
20. Then he inspected the birds, and said,
“Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he
among the absentees?
21. I will punish him most severely, or slay
him, unless he gives me a valid excuse.”
22. But he did not stay for long. He said, “I
have learnt something you did not know. I
have come to you from Sheba, with reliable
information.
23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she
was given of everything, and she has a mag-
nificent throne.
24. I found her and her people worshiping the
sun, instead of Allah. Satan made their con-
duct appear good to them, and diverted them
from the path, so they are not guided.
25. If only they would worship Allah, who
brings to light the mysteries of the heavens
and the earth, and knows what you conceal
and what you reveal.
26. Allah—There is no god but He, the Lord
of the Sublime Throne.”
27. He said, “We will see, whether you have
spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar.
28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to
them; then withdraw from them, and see how
they respond.”
29. She said, “O Counselors, a gracious letter
was delivered to me.
30. It is from Solomon, and it is, ‘In the Name
of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful.
31. Do not defy me, and come to me submis-
sively.’”
32. She said, “O counselors, advise me in this
matter of mine. I never make a decision un-
less you are present.”
33. They said, “We are a people of might and
great courage, but the decision is yours, so
consider what you wish to command.”
34. She said, “When kings enter a city, they
devastate it, and subjugate its dignified peo-
ple. Thus they always do.
14227. THE ANT (an-Naml)
35. I
am sending them a gift, and will see what
the envoys bring back.”
36. When he came to Solomon, he said, “Are
you supplying me with money? What Allah
has given me is better than what He has given
you. It is you who delight in your gift.
37. Go back to them. We will come upon them
with troops they cannot resist; and we will ex-
pel them from there, disgraced and humili-
ated.”
38. He said, “O notables, which one of you will
bring me her throne before they come to me
in submission?”
39. An imp of the sprites said, “I will bring it to
you before you rise from your seat. I am
strong and reliable enough to do it.”
40. He who had knowledge from the Book
said, “I will bring it to you before your glance
returns to you.” And when he saw it settled
before him, he said, “This is from the grace of
my Lord, to test me, whether I am grateful or
ungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude
is to his own credit; but he who is ungrate-
ful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.”
41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and
we shall see whether she will be guided, or re-
mains one of the misguided.”
42. When she arrived, it was said, “Is your
throne like this?” She said, “As if this is it.”
“We were given knowledge before her, and
we were submissive.”
43. But she was prevented by what she wor-
shiped besides Allah; she belonged to a disbe-
lieving people.
44. It was said to her, “Go inside the palace.”
And when she saw it, she thought it was a
deep pond, and she bared her legs. He said,
“It is a palace paved with glass.” She said, “My
Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have
submitted with Solomon, to Allah, Lord of
the Worlds.”
45. And We sent to Thamood their brother
Saleh: “Worship Allah.” But they became two
disputing factions.
46. He said, “O my people, why are you quick
to do evil rather than good? If only you would
seek Allah’s forgiveness, so that you may be
shown mercy.”
47. They said, “We consider you an ill omen,
and those with you.” He said, “Your omen is
with Allah. In fact, you are a people being
tested.”
48. In the city was a gang of nine who made
mischief in the land and did no good.
49. They said, “Swear by Allah to one another
that we will attack him and his family by
night, and then tell his guardian, 'We did not
witness the murder of his family, and we are
being truthful.'“
50. They planned a plan, and We planned a
plan, but they did not notice.
51. So note the outcome of their planning; We
destroyed them and their people, altogether.
52. Here are their homes, in ruins, on account
of their iniquities. Surely in this is a sign for
people who know.
53. And We saved those who believed and
were pious.
54. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do
you commit lewdness with open eyes?
55. Do you lust after men instead of women?
You are truly ignorant people.”
56. But the only response of his people was to
say, “Expel the family of Lot from your town.
They are purist people.”
57. So We saved him and his family, except for
his wife, whom We destined to be among the
laggards.
58. And We rained upon them a rain. Misera-
ble was the rain of those forewarned.
59. Say, “Praise Allah, and peace be upon His
servants whom He has selected. Is Allah bet-
ter, or what they associate?”
60. Or, who created the heavens and the earth,
and rains down water from the sky for you?
With it We produce gardens full of beauty,
whose trees you could not have produced. Is
14327. THE ANT (an-Naml)
there another god with Allah? But they are a
people who equate.
61. Or, who made the earth habitable, and
made rivers flow through it, and set moun-
tains on it, and placed a partition between the
two seas? Is there another god with Allah?
But most of them do not know.
62. Or, who answers the one in need when he
prays to Him, and relieves adversity, and
makes you successors on earth? Is there an-
other god with Allah? How hardly you pay at-
tention.
63. Or, who guides you through the darkness
of land and sea, and who sends the winds as
heralds of His mercy? Is there another god
with Allah? Most exalted is Allah, above what
they associate.
64. Or, who originates the creation and then
repeats it, and who gives you livelihood from
the sky and the earth? Is there another god
with Allah? Say, “Produce your evidence, if
you are truthful.”
65. Say, “No one in the heavens or on earth
knows the future except Allah; and they do
not perceive when they will be resurrected.”
66. In fact, their knowledge of the Hereafter is
confused. In fact, they are in doubt about it.
In fact, they are blind to it.
67. Those who disbelieve say, “When we have
become dust, and our ancestors, shall we be
brought out?
68. We were promised that before, we and our
ancestors—these are nothing but legends of
the ancients.”
69. Say, travel through the earth, and observe
the fate of the guilty.”
70. But do not grieve over them, and do not be
troubled by what they plot.
71. And they say, “When is this promise, if you
are truthful?”
72. Say, “Perhaps some of what you are impa-
tient for has drawn near.”
73. Your Lord is gracious towards humanity,
but most of them are not thankful.
And your Lord knows what their hearts
conceal, and what they reveal.
75. There is no mystery in the heaven and the
earth, but it is in a Clear Book.
76. This Quran relates to the Children of Israel
most of what they differ about.
77. And it is guidance and mercy for the be-
lievers.
78. Your Lord will judge between them by His
wisdom. He is the Almighty, the All-Know-
ing.
79. So rely on Allah. You are upon the clear
truth.
80. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can
you make the deaf hear the call if they turn
their backs and flee.
81. Nor can you guide the blind out of their
straying. You can make no one listen, except
those who believe in Our verses; for they are
Muslims.
82. And when the Word has fallen on them,
We will bring out for them from the earth a
creature which will say to them that the peo-
ple are uncertain of Our revelations.
83. On the Day when We gather from every
community a group of those who rejected
Our revelations; and they will be restrained.
84. Until, when they arrive, He will say, “Did
you reject My revelations without compre-
hending them? Or what is it you were doing?”
85. The Word will come down upon them for
their wrongdoing, and they will not speak.
86. Do they not see that We made the night for
them to rest therein, and the day for visibil-
ity? Surely in that are signs for people who
believe.
87. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown,
everyone in the heavens and the earth will be
horrified, except whomever Allah wills; and
everyone will come before Him in humility.
88. And you see the mountains, and imagine
them fixed, yet they pass, as the passing of the

clouds—the making of Allah, who has per-
fected everything. He is fully Informed of
what you do.
89. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better
than it—and they will be safe from the hor-
rors of that Day.
90. But whoever brings evil—their faces will be
tumbled into the Fire. Will you be rewarded
except for what you used to do?
91. “I was commanded to worship the Lord of
this town, who has sanctified it, and to
Whom everything belongs; and I was com-
manded to be of those who submit.
92. And to recite the Quran.” Whoever is
guided—is guided to his own advantage. And
whoever goes astray, then say, “I am one of
the warners.”
93. And say, “Praise belongs to Allah; He will
show you His signs, and you will recognize
them. Your Lord is not heedless of what you
do.”
28. HISTORY
(al-Qasas)

1. Ta,
Seen, Meem.
2. These
are the Verses of the Clear Book.
narrate to you from the history of Mo-
ses and Pharaoh—in truth—for people who
believe.
4. Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and di-
vided its people into factions. He persecuted
a group of them, slaughtering their sons,
while sparing their daughters. He was truly a
corrupter.
5. But We desired to favor those who were op-
pressed in the land, and to make them lead-
ers, and to make them the inheritors.
6. And to establish them in the land; and to
show Pharaoh, Hamaan, and their troops, the
very thing they feared.
3. We
7. We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse
him; then, when you fear for him, cast him
into the river, and do not fear, nor grieve; We
will return him to you, and make him one of
the messengers.”
8. Pharaoh’s household picked him up, to be
an opponent and a sorrow for them. Pharaoh,
Hamaan, and their troops were sinners.
9. Pharaoh’s wife said, “An eye's delight for me
and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he will
be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a
son.” But they did not foresee.
10. The heart of Moses’ mother became vacant.
She was about to disclose him, had We not
steadied her heart, that she may remain a be-
liever.
11. She said to his sister, “Trail him.” So she
watched him from afar, and they were una-
ware.
12. We forbade him breastfeeding at first. So
she said, “Shall I tell you about a family that
can raise him for you, and will look after
him?”
13. Thus We returned him to his mother, that
she may be comforted, and not grieve, and
know that Allah’s promise is true. But most
of them do not know.
14. And when he reached his maturity, and be-
came established, We gave him wisdom and
knowledge. Thus do We reward the virtuous.
15. Once he entered the city, unnoticed by its
people. He found in it two men fighting—one
of his own sect, and one from his enemies.
The one of his sect solicited his assistance
against the one from his enemies; so Moses
punched him, and put an end to him. He said,
“This is of Satan's doing; he is an enemy that
openly misleads.”
16. He said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself,
so forgive me.” So He forgave him. He is the
Forgiver, the Merciful.
17. He said, “My Lord, in as much as you have
favored me, I will never be a supporter of the
criminals.”
14528. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
18. The next morning, he went about in the
city, fearful and vigilant, when the man who
had sought his assistance the day before was
shouting out to him. Moses said to him, “You
are clearly a troublemaker.”
19. As he was about to strike the one who was
their enemy, he said, “O Moses, do you in-
tend to kill me, as you killed someone yester-
day? You only want to be a bully in the land,
and do not want to be a peacemaker.”
20. And a man came from the farthest part of
the city running. He said, “O Moses, the au-
thorities are considering killing you, so leave;
I am giving you good advice.”
21. So he left, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My
Lord, deliver me from the wrongdoing peo-
ple.”
22. As he headed towards Median, he said,
“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right
way.”
23. And when he arrived at the waters of Me-
dian, he found there a crowd of people draw-
ing water, and he noticed two women waiting
on the side. He said, “What is the matter with
you?” They said, “We cannot draw water un-
til the shepherds depart, and our father is a
very old man.”
24. So he drew water for them, and then with-
drew to the shade, and said, “My Lord, I am
in dire need of whatever good you might send
down to me.”
25. Then, one of the two women approached
him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father
is calling you, to reward you for drawing wa-
ter for us.” And when he came to him, and
told him the story, he said, “Do not fear, you
have escaped from the wrongdoing people.”
26. One of the two women said, “Father, hire
him; the best employee for you is the strong
and trustworthy.”
27. He said, “I want to marry you to one of
these two daughters of mine, provided you
work for me for eight years. But if you com-
plete ten, that is up to you. I do not intend to
impose any hardship on you. You will find
me, Allah willing, one of the righteous.”
28. He said, “Let this be an agreement between
you and me. Whichever of the two terms I
fulfill, there shall be no reprisal against me;
and Allah is witness over what we say.”
29. When Moses had completed the term, and
departed with his family, he noticed a fire by
the side of the Mount. He said to his family,
“Stay here, I have glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I
can bring you some information from there,
or an ember from the fire, that you may warm
yourselves.”
30. When he reached it, he was called from the
right side of the valley, at the Blessed Spot,
from the bush: “O Moses, it is I, Allah, the
Lord of the Worlds.
31. Throw down your staff.” And when he saw
it wiggling, as if it were possessed, he turned
his back to flee, and did not look back. “O
Moses, come forward, and do not fear, you
are perfectly safe.
32. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it
will come out white, without blemish. And
press your arm to your side, against fear.
These are two proofs from your Lord, to
Pharaoh and his dignitaries. They are truly
sinful people.”
33. He said, “My Lord, I have killed one of
them, and I fear they will kill me.
34. And my brother Aaron, he is more elo-
quent than me, so send him with me, to help
me, and to confirm my words, for I fear they
will reject me.”
35. He said, “We will strengthen your arm with
your brother, and We will give you authority,
so they will not touch you. By virtue of Our
signs, you and those who follow you will be
the triumphant.”
36. But when Moses came to them with Our
signs, clear and manifest, they said, “This is
nothing but fabricated magic, and We never
heard of this from our ancestors of old.”
37. Moses said, “My Lord is well aware of him
who brings guidance from Him, and him
who will have the sequel of the abode. The
wrongdoers will not succeed.”
14628. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
38. Pharaoh said, “O nobles, I know of no god
for you other than me. So fire-up the bricks
for me O Hamaan, and build me a tower, that
I may ascend to the God of Moses, though I
think he is a liar.”
39. He and his troops acted arrogantly in the
land, with no justification. They thought they
would not be returned to Us.
40. So We seized him, and his troops, and We
threw them into the sea. Observe, therefore,
what was the end of the oppressors.
41. And We made them leaders calling to the
Fire. And on Resurrection Day, they will not
be saved.
42. And We pursued them in this world with a
curse. And on Resurrection Day, they will be
among the despised.
43. We gave Moses the Scripture after We had
annihilated the previous generations; as an il-
lumination for mankind, and guidance, and
mercy, so that they may remember.
44. You were not on the Western Side when
We decreed the command to Moses, nor
were you among the witnesses.
45. But We established many generations, and
time took its toll on them. Nor were you
among the people of Median, reciting Our
revelations to them. But We kept sending
messengers.
46. Nor were you by the side of the Mount
when We proclaimed. Rather, it was a mercy
from your Lord, that you may warn people
who received no warner before you, so that
they may take heed.
47. Otherwise, if a calamity befell them as a re-
sult of what their hands have perpetrated,
they would say, “Our Lord, if only You had
sent us a messenger, we would have followed
Your revelations, and been among the believ-
ers.”
48. But when the truth came to them from Us,
they said, “If only he was given the like of
what was given to Moses.” Did they not dis-
believe in what was given to Moses in the
past? They said, “Two works of magic back-
ing one another.” And they said, “We are dis-
believing in both.”
49. Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah,
more conductive to guidance than both, and
I will follow it, if you are truthful.”
50. But if they fail to respond to you, know that
they follow their fancies. And who is more
lost than him who follows his fancy without
guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide
the unjust people.
51. We have delivered the Word to them, that
they may remember.
52. Those to whom We gave the Scripture be-
fore it believe in it.
53. When it is recited to them, they say, “We
have believed in it; it is the truth from our
Lord; we were Muslims prior to it.”
54. These will be given their reward twice, be-
cause they persevered; and they counter evil
with good; and from Our provisions to them,
they give.
55. And when they hear vain talk, they avoid
it, and say, “We have our deeds, and you have
your deeds; peace be upon you; we do not de-
sire the ignorant.”
56. You cannot guide whom you love, but Al-
lah guides whom He wills, and He knows best
those who are guided.
57. And they say, “If we follow the guidance
with you, we will be snatched from our land.”
Did We not establish for them a Safe Sanctu-
ary, to which are brought all kinds of fruits,
as provision from Ourselves? But most of
them do not know.
58. And how many a city did We destroy for
turning unappreciative of its livelihood? Here
are their homes, uninhabited after them, ex-
cept for a few. And We became the Inheri-
tors.
59. Your Lord never destroys cities without
first sending a messenger in their midst, re-
citing to them Our revelations. And We
never destroy the cities, unless their people
are wrongdoers.
14728. HISTORY (al-Qasas)
Whatever thing you are given is but the
material of this world, and its glitter. But
what is with Allah is better, and longer last-
ing. Do you not comprehend?
61. Can someone to whom We have made a
fine promise—which he will attain—be equal
to someone to whom We have given enjoy-
ments in this world, but who will be, on Res-
urrection Day, among the arraigned?
62. On the Day when He will call to them, and
say, “Where are My associates whom you
used to claim?”
63. Those against whom the sentence is justi-
fied will say, “Our Lord, these are they whom
we misled. We misled them, as we were mis-
led. We beg Your forgiveness; it was not us
they used to worship.”
64. And it will be said, “Call on your partners.”
And they will call on them, but they will not
respond to them. And they will see the suffer-
ing. If only they were guided.
65. On the Day when He will call to them, and
say, “What did you answer the Messengers?”
66. They will be blinded by the facts on that
Day, and they will not question each other.
67. But he who repents, and believes, and does
righteous deeds, may well be among the win-
ners.
68. Your Lord creates whatever He wills, and
He chooses. The choice is not theirs. Glory be
to Allah, and exalted be He above the associ-
ations they make.
69. And your Lord knows what their hearts
conceal, and what they reveal.
70. And He is Allah. There is no god but He.
To Him belongs all praise in this life, and in
the next. And His is the decision, and to Him
you will be returned.
71. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah
made the night perpetual over you until the
Day of Resurrection, which god other than
Allah will bring you illumination? Do you
not hear?”
72. Say, “Have you considered? Had Allah
made the day perpetual over you until the
60.
Day of Resurrection, which god other than
Allah will bring you night to rest in? Do you
not see?”
73. It is out of His mercy that He made for you
the night and the day, that you may rest in it,
and seek some of His bounty; and that you
may give thanks.
74. On the Day when He will call to them, and
say, “Where are My associates whom you
used to claim?”
75. And We will draw out from every commu-
nity a witness, and say, “Produce your evi-
dence.” Then they will realize that the truth is
Allah’s, and those they used to invent have
forsaken them.
76. Quaroon belonged to the clan of Moses,
but he oppressed them. We had given him
treasures, the keys of which would weigh
down a group of strong men. His people said
to him, “Do not exult; Allah does not love the
exultant.
77. But seek, with what Allah has given you,
the Home of the Hereafter, and do not ne-
glect your share of this world. And be chari-
table, as Allah has been charitable to you.
And do not seek corruption in the land. Allah
does not like the seekers of corruption.”
78. He said, “I was given all this on account of
knowledge I possess.” Did he not know that
Allah destroyed many generations before
him, who were stronger than he, and pos-
sessed greater riches? But the guilty will not
be asked about their sins.
79. And he went out before his people in his
splendor. Those who desired the worldly life
said, “If only we possessed the likes of what
Quaroon was given. He is indeed very fortu-
nate.”
80. But those who were given knowledge said,
“Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for
those who believe and do righteous deeds.”
Yet none attains it except the steadfast.
81. So We caused the earth to cave in on him
and his mansion. He had no company to save
him from Allah, and he could not defend
himself.
14829. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
82. Those who had wished they were in his po-
sition the day before were saying, “Indeed, it
is Allah who spreads the bounty to whomever
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Had
Allah not been gracious to us, He would have
caved in on us. No wonder the ungrateful
never prosper.”
83. That Home of the Hereafter—We assign it
for those who seek no superiority on earth,
nor corruption. And the outcome is for the
cautious.
84. Whoever brings a virtue will receive better
than it. But whoever brings evil—the evildo-
ers will be rewarded only according to what
they used to do.
85. He Who ordained the Quran for you will
return you Home. Say, “My Lord knows best
who comes with guidance, and who is in
manifest error.”
86. You did not expect the Scripture to be
transmitted to you, except as mercy from
your Lord. Therefore, do not be a supporter
of the disbelievers.
87. And do not let them divert you from Al-
lah’s revelations after they have been revealed
to you. And pray to your Lord, and never be
of the polytheists.
88. And do not invoke with Allah any other
god. There is no god but He. All things per-
ish, except His presence. His is the judgment,
and to Him you will be returned.
29. THE SPIDER

the people supposed that they will be
left alone to say, “We believe,” without being
put to the test?
3. We have tested those before them. Allah
will surely know the truthful, and He will
surely know the liars.
2. Have

fool Us? Terrible is their opinion!
looks forward to the meeting with
Allah—the appointed time of Allah is com-
ing. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.
6. Whoever strives, strives only for himself.
Allah is Independent of the beings.
7. Those who believe and do righteous
deeds—We will remit their sins, and We will
reward them according to the best of what
they used to do.
8. We have advised the human being to be
good to his parents. But if they urge you to
associate with Me something you have no
knowledge of, do not obey them. To Me is
your return; and I will inform you of what
you used to do.
9. Those who believe and do good works—We
will admit them into the company of the
righteous.
10. Among the people is he who says, “We
have believed in Allah.” Yet when he is
harmed on Allah’s account, he equates the
people's persecution with Allah’s retribution.
And if help comes from your Lord, he says,
“We were actually with you.” Is not Allah
aware of what is inside the hearts of the peo-
ple?
11. Allah certainly knows those who believe,
and He certainly knows the hypocrites.
12. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-
lieve, “Follow our way, and we will carry your
sins.” In no way can they carry any of their
sins. They are liars.
13. They will carry their own loads, and other
loads with their own. And they will be ques-
tioned on the Day of Resurrection concern-
ing what they used to fabricate.
14. We sent Noah to his people, and He stayed
among them for a thousand years minus fifty
years. Then the Deluge swept them; for they
were wrongdoers.
15. But We saved him, together with the com-
pany of the Ark, and We made it a sign for all
peoples.
5. Whoever
14929. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
16. And Abraham, when he said to his people,
“Worship Allah, and fear Him. That is better
for you, if you only knew.
17. You worship idols besides Allah, and you
fabricate falsehoods. Those you worship, in-
stead of Allah, cannot provide you with live-
lihood. So seek your livelihood from Allah,
and worship Him, and thank Him. To Him
you will be returned.”
18. If you disbelieve, communities before you
have also disbelieved. The Messenger is only
responsible for clear transmission.
19. Have they not seen how Allah originates
the creation, and then reproduces it? This is
easy for Allah.
20. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe how He
originated the creation.” Then Allah will
bring about the next existence. Allah has
power over all things.”
21. He punishes whom He wills, and He grants
mercy to whom He wills, and to Him you will
be restored.
22. You cannot escape, on earth or in the
heaven; and you have no protector and no
savior besides Allah.
23. Those who disbelieved in Allah’s signs and
His encounter—these have despaired of My
mercy. For them is a painful torment.
24. But the only response from his people was
their saying, “Kill him, or burn him.” But Al-
lah saved him from the fire. Surely in that are
signs for people who believe.
25. And he said, “You have chosen idols in-
stead of Allah, out of affection for one an-
other in the worldly life. But then, on the Day
of Resurrection, you will disown one another,
and curse one another. Your destiny is Hell,
and you will have no saviors.”
26. Then Lot believed in him, and said, “I am
emigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the
Wise.”
27. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and
conferred on his descendants the
Prophethood and the Book, and gave him his
reward in this life; and in the Hereafter he will
be among the upright.
28. And Lot, when he said to his people, “You
are committing an obscenity not perpetrated
before you by anyone in the whole world.
29. You approach men, and cut off the way,
and commit lewdness in your gatherings.”
But the only response from his people was to
say, “Bring upon us Allah’s punishment, if
you are truthful.”
30. He said, “My Lord, help me against the
people of corruption.”
31. And when Our envoys brought Abraham
the good news, they said, “We are going to
destroy the people of this town; its people are
wrongdoers.”
32. He said, “Yet Lot is in it.” They said, “We
are well aware of who is in it. We will save
him, and his family, except for his wife, who
will remain behind.”
33. Then, when Our envoys came to Lot, they
were mistreated, and he was troubled and
distressed on their account. They said, “Do
not fear, nor grieve. We will save you and
your family, except for your wife, who will re-
main behind.”
34. “We will bring down upon the people of
this town a scourge from heaven, because of
their wickedness.”
35. And We left behind a clear trace of it, for
people who understand.
36. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He
said, “O my people, worship Allah and antic-
ipate the Last Day, and do not spread corrup-
tion in the land.”
37. But they rejected him, so the tremor over-
took them, and they were left motionless in
their homes.
38. And Aad and Thamood. It has become
clear to you from their dwellings. Satan em-
bellished for them their deeds, barring them
from the path, even though they could see.
15029. THE SPIDER (al-’Ankabut)
And Quaroon, and Pharaoh, and Ha-
maan—Moses went to them with clear argu-
ments, but they acted arrogantly in the land.
And they could not get ahead.
40. Each We seized by his sin. Against some
We sent a sandstorm. Some were struck by
the Blast. Some We caused the ground to cave
in beneath them. And some We drowned. It
was not Allah who wronged them, but it was
they who wronged their own selves.
41. The likeness of those who take to them-
selves protectors other than Allah is that of
the spider. It builds a house. But the most
fragile of houses is the spider’s house. If they
only knew.
42. Allah knows what they invoke besides
Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
43. These examples—We put them forward to
the people; but none grasps them except the
learned.
44. Allah created the heavens and the earth
with truth. Surely in that is a sign for the be-
lievers.
45. Recite what is revealed to you of the Scrip-
ture, and perform the prayer. The prayer pre-
vents indecencies and evils. And the remem-
brance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows
what you do.
46. And do not argue with the People of the
Scripture except in the best manner possible,
except those who do wrong among them.
And say, “We believe in what was revealed to
us, and in what was revealed to you; and our
God and your God is One; and to Him we are
submissive.”
47. Likewise, We revealed to you the Scripture.
Those to whom We gave the Scripture believe
in it, and some of these believe in it. None re-
nounce Our communications except the dis-
believers.
48. You did not read any scripture before this,
nor did you write it down with your right
hand; otherwise the falsifiers would have
doubted.
39.
49. In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those
given knowledge. No one renounce Our signs
except the unjust.
50. And they said, “If only a miracle from his
Lord was sent down to him.” Say, “Miracles
are only with Allah, and I am only a clear
warner.”
51. Does it not suffice them that We revealed
to you the Scripture, which is recited to them?
In that is mercy and a reminder for people
who believe.
52. Say, “Allah suffices as witness between you
and me. He knows everything in the heavens
and the Earth. Those who believe in vanity
and reject Allah—it is they who are the los-
ers.”
53. And they urge you to hasten the punish-
ment. Were it not for a specified time, the
punishment would have come to them. But it
will come upon them suddenly, while they
are unaware.
54. They urge you to hasten the punishment.
But Hell will engulf the disbelievers.
55. On the Day when the punishment will en-
velop them, from above them, and from be-
neath their feet, He will say, “Taste what you
used to do!”
56. O My servants who have believed: My
earth is vast, so worship Me alone.
57. Every soul will taste death. Then to Us you
will be returned.
58. Those who believe and work righteous-
ness—We will settle them in Paradise, in
mansions under which rivers flow, dwelling
therein forever. Excellent is the compensa-
tion for the workers.
59. Those who endure patiently, and in their
Lord they trust.
60. How many a creature there is that does not
carry its provision? Allah provides for them,
and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knowl-
edgeable.
61. And if you asked them, “Who created the
heavens and the earth and regulated the sun
15130. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)
and the moon?” They would say, “Allah.”
Why then do they deviate?
62. Allah expands the provision for whomever
He wills of His servants, and restricts it. Allah
is Cognizant of all things.
63. And if you asked them, “Who sends water
down from the sky, with which He revives the
earth after it had died?” They would say, “Al-
lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of
them do not understand.
64. The life of this world is nothing but diver-
sion and play, and the Home of the Hereafter
is the Life, if they only knew.
65. When they embark on a vessel, they pray
to Allah, devoting their faith to Him; but
once He has delivered them safely to land,
they attribute partners to Him.
66. To be ungrateful for what We have given
them, and to enjoy themselves. They will
surely come to know.
67. Do they not see that We established a Se-
cure Sanctuary, while all around them the
people are being carried away? Do they be-
lieve in falsehood, and reject the blessings of
Allah?
68. And who does greater wrong than he who
fabricates lies and attributes them to Allah, or
calls the truth a lie when it has come to him?
Is there not in Hell a dwelling for the blas-
phemers?
69. As for those who strive for Us—We will
guide them in Our ways. Allah is with the do-
ers of good.
30. THE ROMANS
(ar-Rum)

1. Alif, Lam, Meem.
2. The Romans have been defeated.
3. In a nearby territory. But following their de-
feat, they will be victorious.
4. In a few years. The matter is up to Allah, in
the past, and in the future. On that day, the
believers will rejoice.
5. In Allah’s support. He supports whomever
He wills. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.
6. The promise of Allah—Allah never breaks
His promise, but most people do not know.
7. They know an outer aspect of the worldly
life, but they are heedless of the Hereafter.
8. Do they not reflect within themselves? Al-
lah did not create the heavens and the earth,
and what is between them, except with rea-
son, and for a specific duration. But most
people, regarding meeting their Lord, are dis-
believers.
9. Have they not travelled the earth and seen
how those before them ended up? They were
more powerful than them, and they culti-
vated the land and developed it more than
they developed it, and their messengers came
to them with clear signs. Allah would never
wrong them, but they used to wrong them-
selves.
10. Then, evil was the end of those who com-
mitted evil. That is because they rejected Al-
lah’s revelations, and used to ridicule them.
11. Allah originates creation, and then repeats
it. Then to Him you will be returned.
12. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the
guilty will despair.
13. They will have no intercessors from among
their idols, and they will disown their part-
ners.
14. On the Day when the Hour takes place—
on that Day they will separate.
15. As for those who believed and did good
deeds—they will be delighted in meadows.
16. But as for those who disbelieved, and re-
jected Our signs and the encounter of the
Hereafter—those will be hauled into the tor-
ment.
17. So glorify Allah when you retire at night,
and when you rise in the morning.
15230. THE ROMANS (ar-Rum)
His is the praise in the heavens and on
earth, and in the evening, and when you
reach midday.
19. He brings the living out of the dead, and He
brings the dead out of the living, and He re-
vives the land after it had died. Likewise you
will be resurrected.
20. And of His signs is that He created you
from dust; and behold, you become humans
spreading out.
21. And of His signs is that He created for you
mates from among yourselves, so that you
may find tranquility in them; and He planted
love and compassion between you. In this are
signs for people who reflect.
22. And of His signs is the creation of the heav-
ens and the earth, and the diversity of your
languages and colors. In this are signs for
those who know.
23. And of His signs are your sleep by night
and day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In
this are signs for people who listen.
24. And of His signs is that He shows you the
lightning, causing fear and hope. And He
brings down water from the sky, and with it
He revives the earth after it was dead. In this
are signs for people who understand.
25. And of His signs is that the heaven and the
earth stand at His disposal. And then, when
He calls you out of the earth, you will emerge
at once.
26. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens
and the earth. All are submissive to Him.
27. It is He who initiates creation, and then re-
peats it, something easy for Him. His is the
highest attribute, in the heavens and the
earth. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
28. He illustrates an example for you, from
your own selves: do you make your servants
full partners in the wealth We have given
you? Do you revere them as you revere one
another? We thus explain the revelations for
a people who understand.
29. Yet the wrongdoers follow their desires
without knowledge. But who can guide
18.
whom Allah leaves astray? They will have no
helpers.
30. So devote yourself to the religion of mono-
theism—the natural instinct Allah has in-
stilled in mankind. There is no altering Al-
lah’s creation. This is the true religion, but
most people do not know.
31. Turning towards Him—and be conscious
of Him, and perform the prayer, and do not
be of the idolaters.
32. Of those who divided their religion, and
became sects; each faction pleased with what
they have.
33. When affliction touches the people, they
call on their Lord, turning to Him in repent-
ance. But then, when He gives them a taste of
His mercy, some of them attribute partners to
their Lord.
34. To show ingratitude for what We have
given them. Indulge yourselves—you will
surely know.
35. Have We sent down to them any authority,
which speaks in support of their idols?
36. When We give people a taste of mercy, they
rejoice in it. But when adversity befalls them,
because of what their hands have perpetrated,
they begin to despair.
37. Do they not see that Allah expands the pro-
vision for whomever He wills, or restricts it?
Surely in this are signs for people who be-
lieve.
38. So give the relative his rights, and the des-
titute, and the wayfarer. That is best for those
who seek Allah’s presence. Those are the
prosperous.
39. The usury you practice, seeking thereby to
multiply people’s wealth, will not multiply
with Allah. But what you give in charity, de-
siring Allah’s approval—these are the multi-
pliers.
40. Allah is He who created you, then provides
for you, then makes you die, then brings you
back to life. Can any of your idols do any of
that? Glorified is He, and Exalted above what
they associate.
15331. LUQMAN (Luqman)
41. Corruption has appeared on land and sea,
because of what people’s hands have earned,
in order to make them taste some of what
they have done, so that they might return.
42. Say, “Roam the earth, and observe the fate
of those who came before. Most of them were
idolaters.”
43. So devote yourself to the upright religion,
before there comes from Allah a Day that
cannot be averted. On that Day, they will be
shocked.
44. Whoever disbelieves, upon him falls his
disbelief. And whoever acts righteously—
they are preparing for themselves.
45. So that He may reward those who have be-
lieved and done the righteous deeds out of
His bounty. Indeed, He does not love the un-
grateful.
46. And of His signs is that He sends the winds
bearing good news, to give you a taste of His
mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His
command, and so that you may seek of His
bounty, and so that you may give thanks.
47. Before you, We sent messengers to their
people. They came to them with clear proofs.
Then We took revenge on those who sinned.
It is incumbent on Us to help the believers.
48. Allah is He who sends the winds. They stir
up clouds. Then He spreads them in the sky
as He wills. And He breaks them apart. Then
you see rain drops issuing from their midst.
Then, when He makes it fall upon whom He
wills of His servants, behold, they rejoice.
49. Although they were before this—before it
was sent down upon them—in despair.
50. So observe the effects of Allah’s mercy—
how He revives the earth after it was dead. In-
deed, He is the Reviver of the dead. He is Ca-
pable of everything.
51. But if We send a wind, and they see it turn-
ing things yellow, they would continue there-
after to disbelieve.
52. You cannot make the dead hear, nor can
you make the deaf hear the call when they
turn away.
53. Nor can you guide the blind out of their er-
ror. You can make hear only those who be-
lieve in Our signs, and so have submitted.
54. Allah is He Who created you weak, then af-
ter weakness gave you strength, then after
strength gave you weakness and gray hair. He
creates whatever He wills. He is the Omnisci-
ent, the Omnipotent.
55. On the Day when the Hour takes place, the
sinners will swear they had stayed but an
hour. Thus they were deluded.
56. But those endowed with knowledge and
faith will say, “You remained in Allah’s Book
until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day
of Resurrection, but you did not know.”
57. On that Day, the sinners’ excuses will not
benefit them, nor will they be excused.
58. We have cited in this Quran for the people
every sort of parable. But even if you bring
them a miracle, those who disbelieve will say,
“You are nothing but fakers.”
59. Allah thus seals the hearts of those who do
not know.
60. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true.
And do not let those who lack certainty belit-
tle you.

who observe the prayer, and pay the
obligatory charity, and are certain of the
Hereafter.
5. These are upon guidance from their Lord.
These are the successful.
6. Among the people is he who trades in dis-
tracting tales; intending, without knowledge,
to lead away from Allah’s way, and to make a

mockery of it. These will have a humiliating
punishment.
7. And when Our Verses are recited to him, he
turns away in pride, as though he did not hear
them, as though there is deafness in his ears.
So inform him of a painful punishment.
8. As for those who believe and do good
deeds—for them are the Gardens of Bliss.
9. Dwelling therein forever. The promise of
Allah is true. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
10. He created the heavens without pillars that
you can see, and placed stabilizers on earth
lest it shifts with you, and scattered through-
out it all kinds of creatures. And from the sky
We sent down water, and caused to grow
therein of every noble pair.
11. Such is Allah’s creation. Now show me
what those besides Him have created. In fact,
the wicked are in obvious error.
12. We endowed Luqman with wisdom: “Give
thanks to Allah.” Whoever is appreciative—
is appreciative for the benefit of his own soul.
And whoever is unappreciative—Allah is
Sufficient and Praiseworthy.
13. When Luqman said to his son, as he ad-
vised him, “O my son, do not associate any-
thing with Allah, for idolatry is a terrible
wrong.”
14. We have entrusted the human being with
the care of his parents. His mother carried
him through hardship upon hardship, wean-
ing him in two years. So give thanks to Me,
and to your parents. To Me is the destination.
15. But if they strive to have you associate with
Me something of which you have no
knowledge, do not obey them. But keep them
company in this life, in kindness, and follow
the path of him who turns to Me. Then to Me
is your return; and I will inform you of what
you used to do.
16. “O my son, even if it were the weight of a
mustard-seed, in a rock, or in the heavens, or
on earth, Allah will bring it to light. Allah is
Kind and Expert.
O my son, observe the prayer, advocate
righteousness, forbid evil, and be patient over
what has befallen you. These are of the most
honorable traits.
18. And do not treat people with arrogance,
nor walk proudly on earth. Allah does not
love the arrogant showoffs.
19. And moderate your stride, and lower your
voice. The most repulsive of voices is the
donkey’s voice.”
20. Do you not see how Allah placed at your
service everything in the heavens and the
earth? How He showered you with His bless-
ings, both outward and inward? Yet among
the people is he who argues about Allah with-
out knowledge, without guidance, and with-
out an enlightening Scripture.
21. And when it is said to them, “Follow what
Allah has revealed,” they say, “Rather, we fol-
low what we found our parents devoted to.”
Even if Satan is calling them to the suffering
of the Blaze?
22. Whoever submits himself wholly to Allah,
and is a doer of good, has grasped the most
trustworthy handle. With Allah rests the out-
come of all events.
23. Whoever disbelieves—let not his disbelief
sadden you. To Us is their return. Then We
will inform them of what they did. Allah
knows what lies within the hearts.
24. We give them a little comfort; then We
compel them to a harsh torment.
25. And if you ask them, “Who created the
heavens and the earth?” They will say, “Al-
lah.” Say, “Praise be to Allah.” But most of
them do not know.
26. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth. Allah is the Rich, the Praised.
27. If all the trees on earth were pens, filled by
the ocean, with seven more oceans besides,
the Words of Allah would not run out. Allah
is Majestic and Wise.
28. Your creation and your resurrection are
only as a single soul. Allah is Hearing and
Seeing.
17.
15532. PROSTRATION (as-Sajdah)
29. Have you not seen how Allah merges the
night into the day, and merges the day into
the night? That He subjected the sun and the
moon, each running for a stated term? And
that Allah is Cognizant of everything you do?
30. That is because Allah is the Reality, and
what they worship besides Him is falsehood,
and because Allah is the Exalted, the Su-
preme.
31. Have you not seen how the ships sail
through the sea, by the grace of Allah, to
show you of His wonders? In that are signs
for every persevering, thankful person.
32. When waves, like canopies, cover them,
they call upon Allah, devoting their religion
to Him. But when He has delivered them to
dry land, some of them waver. No one re-
nounces Our revelations except the treacher-
ous blasphemer.
33. O people! Be conscious of your Lord, and
dread a Day when no parent can avail his
child, nor can a child avail his parent, in any-
thing. The promise of Allah is true. There-
fore, do not let this life deceive you, nor let
illusions deceive you regarding Allah.
34. With Allah rests the knowledge of the
Hour. He sends down the rain, and He knows
what the wombs contain. No soul knows
what it will reap tomorrow, and no soul
knows in what land it will die. Allah is All-
Knowing, Well-Informed.
32. PROSTRATION
(as-Sajdah)

1. Alif,
Lam, Meem.
2. The revelation of the Book, without a doubt,
is from the Lord of the Universe.
Yet they say, “He made it up.” In fact, it is
the Truth from your Lord, to warn a people
who received no warner before you, that they
may be guided.
3.
4. Allah is He who created
the heavens and the
earth and everything between them in six
days, and then established Himself on the
Throne. Apart from Him, you have no mas-
ter and no intercessor. Will you not reflect?
5. He regulates all affairs, from the heavens, to
the earth. Then it ascends to Him on a Day
the length of which is a thousand years by
your count.
6. That is the Knower of the Invisible and the
Visible, the Powerful, the Merciful.
7. He who perfected everything He created,
and originated the creation of man from clay.
8. Then made his reproduction from an ex-
tract of an insignificant fluid.
9. Then He proportioned him, and breathed
into him of His Spirit. Then He gave you the
hearing, and the eyesight, and the brains—
but rarely do you give thanks.
10. And they say, “When we are lost into the
earth, shall we be in a new creation?” In fact,
they deny the meeting with their Lord.
11. Say, “The angel of death put in charge of
you will reclaim you. Then to your Lord you
will be returned.”
12. If only you could see the guilty, bowing
their heads before their Lord: “Our Lord, we
have seen and we have heard, so send us back,
and we will act righteously; we are now con-
vinced.”
13. Had We willed, We could have given every
soul its guidance, but the declaration from
Me will come true: “I will fill Hell with jinn
and humans, altogether.”
14. So taste, because you forgot the meeting of
this Day of yours; We have forgotten you; so
taste the eternal torment for what you used to
do.
15. They believe in Our communications,
those who, when reminded of them, fall
down prostrate, and glorify their Lord with
praise, and are not proud.
16. Their sides shun their beds, as they pray to
their Lord, out of reverence and hope; and
from Our provisions to them, they give.
15633. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
No soul knows what eye’s delight awaits
them—a reward for what they used to do.
18. Is someone who is faithful like someone
who is a sinner? They are not equal.
19. As for those who believe and do righteous
deeds, for them are the Gardens of Shelter—
hospitality for what they used to do.
20. But as for those who transgressed, their
shelter is the Fire. Every time they try to get
out of it, they will be brought back into it, and
it will be said to them, “Taste the suffering of
the Fire which you used to deny.”
21. We will make them taste the lesser tor-
ment, prior to the greater torment, so that
they may return.
22. Who is more wrong than he, who, when
reminded of his Lord’s revelations, turns
away from them? We will certainly wreak
vengeance upon the criminals.
23. We gave Moses the Book; so do not be in
doubt regarding His encounter; and We
made it a guidance for the Children of Israel.
24. And We appointed leaders from among
them, guiding by Our command, as long as
they persevered and were certain of Our
communications.
25. Your Lord will judge between them on the
Day of Resurrection regarding everything
they had disputed.
26. Is it not a lesson for them, how many gen-
erations We have destroyed before them, in
whose habitations they walk? Surely in that
are signs. Do they not hear?
27. Do they not see how We conduct the water
to a dry land, and with it We produce vegeta-
tion, from which their livestock eat, and
themselves? Do they not see?
28. And they say, “When is this victory, if you
are truthful?”
29. Say, “On the day of victory, the faith of
those who disbelieved will be of no avail to
them, and they will not be granted respite.”
30. So turn away from them, and wait. They
too are waiting.
17.
33. THE CONFEDERATES
(al-Ahzab)

1. O
Prophet! Fear Allah, and do not obey the
unbelievers and the hypocrites. Allah is
Knowledgeable and Wise.
2. And follow what is revealed to you from
your Lord. Allah is fully aware of what you
do.
3. And put your trust in Allah. Allah is enough
as a trustee.
4. Allah did not place two hearts inside any
man's body. Nor did He make your wives
whom you equate with your mothers, your
actual mothers. Nor did He make your
adopted sons, your actual sons. These are
your words coming out of your mouths. Al-
lah speaks the truth, and guides to the path.
5. Call them after their fathers; that is more
equitable with Allah. But if you do not know
their fathers, then your brethren in faith and
your friends. There is no blame on you if you
err therein, barring what your hearts pre-
meditates. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
6. The Prophet is more caring of the believers
than they are of themselves, and his wives are
mothers to them. And blood-relatives are
closer to one another in Allah’s Book than the
believers or the emigrants, though you
should do good to your friends. That is in-
scribed in the Book.
7. Recall that We received a pledge from the
prophets, and from you, and from Noah, and
Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus son of Mary.
We received from them a solemn pledge.
8. That He may ask the sincere about their sin-
cerity. He has prepared for the disbelievers a
painful punishment.
9. O you who believe! Remember Allah’s
blessings upon you, when forces came against
you, and We sent against them a wind, and
15733. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
forces you did not see. Allah is Observant of
what you do.
10. When they came upon you, from above
you, and from beneath you; and the eyes be-
came dazed, and the hearts reached the
throats, and you harbored doubts about Al-
lah.
11. There and then the believers were tested,
and were shaken most severely.
12. When the hypocrites and those in whose
hearts is sickness said, “Allah and His Mes-
senger promised us nothing but illusion.”
13. And when a group of them said, “O people
of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so re-
treat.” And a faction of them asked the
Prophet to excuse them, saying, “Our homes
are exposed,” although they were not ex-
posed. They only wanted to flee.
14. Had it been invaded from its sides, and
they were asked to dissent, they would have
done so with little hesitation.
15. Although they had made a pledged to Al-
lah, in the past, that they will not turn their
backs. A pledge to Allah is a responsibility.
16. Say, “Flight will not benefit you, if you flee
from death or killing, even then you will be
given only brief enjoyment.”
17. Say, “Who is it who will shield you from
Allah, if He intends adversity for you, or in-
tends mercy for you?” Besides Allah, they will
find for themselves neither friend nor helper.
18. Allah already knows the hinderers among
you, and those who say to their brethren,
“Come and join us.” Rarely do they mobilize
for battle.
19. Being stingy towards you. And when fear
approaches, you see them staring at you—
their eyes rolling—like someone fainting at
death. Then, when panic is over, they whip
you with sharp tongues. They resent you any
good. These have never believed, so Allah has
nullified their works; a matter easy for Allah.
20. They assumed that the confederates had
not withdrawn. But were the confederates to
advance, they would wish they were in the de-
sert with the Bedouins, inquiring about your
news. And if they were among you, they
would have done little fighting.
21. You have an excellent example in the Mes-
senger of Allah; for anyone who seeks Allah
and the Last Day, and remembers Allah fre-
quently.
22. And when the believers saw the confeder-
ates, they said, “This is what Allah and His
messenger have promised us; and Allah and
His messenger have told the truth.” And it
only increased them in faith and submission.
23. Of the believers are men who are true to
what they pledged to Allah. Some of them
have fulfilled their vows; and some are still
waiting, and never wavering.
24. That Allah may reward the truthful for
their truthfulness; and punish the hypocrites,
if He wills, or pardon them. Allah is Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.
25. Allah repelled the disbelievers in their rage;
they gained no advantage. Allah thus spared
the believers combat. Allah is Strong and
Mighty.
26. And He brought down from their strong-
holds those of the People of the Book who
backed them, and He threw terror into their
hearts. Some of them you killed, and others
you took captive.
27. And He made you inherit their land, and
their homes, and their possessions, and a re-
gion you have never stepped on. Allah has
power over all things.
28. O Prophet! Say to your wives, “If you desire
the life of this world and its finery, then let me
compensate you, and release you kindly.
29. But if you desire Allah, His Messenger, and
the Home of the Hereafter, then Allah has
prepared for the righteous among you a mag-
nificent compensation.”
30. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you
commits a proven indecency, the punish-
ment for her will be doubled. And that would
be easy for Allah.
15833. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
But whoever of you remains obedient to
Allah and His Messenger, and acts right-
eously, We will give her a double reward; and
We have prepared for her a generous provi-
sion.
32. O wives of the Prophet! You are not like
any other women, if you observe piety. So do
not speak too softly, lest the sick at heart lusts
after you, but speak in an appropriate man-
ner.
33. And settle in your homes; and do not dis-
play yourselves, as in the former days of igno-
rance. And perform the prayer, and give reg-
ular charity, and obey Allah and His Messen-
ger. Allah desires to remove all impurity from
you, O People of the Household, and to pu-
rify you thoroughly.
34. And remember what is recited in your
homes of Allah's revelations and wisdom. Al-
lah is Kind and Informed.
35. Muslim men and Muslim women, believ-
ing men and believing women, obedient men
and obedient women, truthful men and
truthful women, patient men and patient
women, humble men and humble women,
charitable men and charitable women, fast-
ing men and fasting women, men who guard
their chastity and women who guard, men
who remember Allah frequently and women
who remember—Allah has prepared for
them a pardon, and an immense reward.
36. It is not for any believer, man or woman,
when Allah and His Messenger have decided
a matter, to have liberty of choice in their de-
cision. Whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes-
senger has gone far astray.
37. When you said to him whom Allah had
blessed, and you had favored, “Keep your
wife to yourself, and fear Allah.” But you hid
within yourself what Allah was to reveal. And
you feared the people, but it was Allah you
were supposed to fear. Then, when Zaid
ended his relationship with her, We gave her
to you in marriage, that there may be no re-
striction for believers regarding the wives of
their adopted sons, when their relationship
31.
has ended. The command of Allah was ful-
filled.
38. There is no blame on the Prophet regard-
ing what Allah has ordained for him. Such is
the pattern of Allah among those who passed
before. The command of Allah is an absolute
decree.
39. Those who deliver the messages of Allah,
and fear Him, and never fear anyone except
Allah. Allah is sufficient as a reckoner.
40. Muhammad is not the father of any of your
men; but he is the Messenger of Allah, and
the seal of the prophets. Allah is Cognizant of
everything.
41. O you who believe, remember Allah with
frequent remembrance.
42. And
glorify Him morning and evening.
It is He who reaches out to you, and His
angels, to bring you out of darkness into the
light. And He is Ever-Merciful towards the
believers.
44. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him
is, “Peace,” and He has prepared for them a
generous reward.
45. O prophet! We have sent you as a witness,
and a bearer of good news, and a warner.
46. And a caller towards Allah by His leave,
and an illuminating beacon.
47. And give the believers the good news that
for them is a great reward.
48. And do not obey the blasphemers and the
hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and rely
on Allah. Allah is a sufficient protector.
49. O you who believe! When you marry be-
lieving women, but then divorce them before
you have touched them, there is no waiting
period for you to observe in respect to them;
but compensate them, and release them in a
graceful manner.
50. O Prophet! We have permitted to you your
wives to whom you have given their dowries,
and those you already have, as granted to you
by Allah, and the daughters of your paternal
uncle, and the daughters of your paternal
43.
15933. THE CONFEDERATES (al-Ahzab)
aunts, and the daughters of your maternal
uncle, and the daughters of your maternal
aunts who emigrated with you, and a believ-
ing woman who has offered herself to the
Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her,
exclusively for you, and not for the believers.
We know what We have ordained for them
regarding their wives and those their right-
hands possess. This is to spare you any diffi-
culty. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
51. You may defer any of them you wish, and
receive any of them you wish. Should you de-
sire any of those you had deferred, there is no
blame on you. This is more proper, so that
they will be comforted, and not be grieved,
and be content with what you have given
each one of them. Allah knows what is within
your hearts. Allah is Omniscient and Clem-
ent.
52. Beyond that, no other women are permis-
sible for you, nor can you exchange them for
other wives, even if you admire their beauty,
except those you already have. Allah is
Watchful over all things.
53. O you who believe! Do not enter the homes
of the Prophet, unless you are given permis-
sion to come for a meal; and do not wait for
its preparation. And when you are invited, go
in. And when you have eaten, disperse, with-
out lingering for conversation. This irritates
the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but
Allah does not shy away from the truth. And
when you ask his wives for something, ask
them from behind a screen; that is purer for
your hearts and their hearts. You must never
offend the Messenger of Allah, nor must you
ever marry his wives after him, for that would
be an enormity with Allah.
54. Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, Al-
lah is Aware of all things.
55. There is no blame on them concerning
their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers,
or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons,
or their women, or their female servants. But
they should remain conscious of Allah. Allah
is Witness over all things.
56. Allah and His angels give blessings to the
Prophet. O you who believe, call for blessings
on him, and greet him with a prayer of peace.
57. Those who insult Allah and His Messen-
ger, Allah has cursed them in this life and in
the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a
demeaning punishment.
58. Those who harm believing men and believ-
ing women, for acts they did not commit,
bear the burden of perjury and a flagrant sin.
59. O Prophet! Tell your wives, and your
daughters, and the women of the believers, to
lengthen their garments. That is more
proper, so they will be recognized and not
harassed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
60. If the hypocrites, and those with sickness
in their hearts, and the rumormongers in the
City, do not desist, We will incite you against
them; then they will not be your neighbors
there except for a short while.
61. They are cursed; wherever they are found,
they should be captured and killed outright.
62. Such has been Allah’s precedent with those
who passed away before. You will find no
change in Allah’s system.
63. The people ask you about the Hour. Say,
“The knowledge thereof rests with Allah. But
what do you know? Perhaps the hour is near.”
64. Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has
prepared for them a Blaze.
65. Dwelling therein forever, not finding a
protector or a savior.
66. The Day when their faces are flipped into
the Fire, they will say, “If only we had obeyed
Allah and obeyed the Messenger.”
67. And they will say, “Lord, we have obeyed
our superiors and our dignitaries, but they
led us away from the way.
68. Lord, give them double the punishment,
and curse them with a great curse.”
69. O you who believe! Do not be like those
who abused Moses; but Allah cleared him of
what they said. He was distinguished with Al-
lah.
16034. SHEBA (Saba’)
70. O
you who believe! Be conscious of Allah,
and speak in a straightforward manner.
71. He will rectify your conduct for you, and
will forgive you your sins. Whoever obeys Al-
lah and His Messenger has won a great vic-
tory.
72. We offered the Trust to the heavens, and
the earth, and the mountains; but they re-
fused to bear it, and were apprehensive of it;
but the human being accepted it. He was un-
fair and ignorant.
73. Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and
women, and the idolaters, men and women.
And Allah will redeem the believers, men and
women. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Mer-
ciful.
34. SHEBA
(Saba’)

1. Praise
be to Allah, to Whom belongs every-
thing in the heavens and the earth; and praise
be to Him in the Hereafter. He is the Wise,
the Expert.
2. He knows what penetrates into the earth,
and what comes out of it, and what descends
from the sky, and what ascends to it. He is the
Merciful, the Forgiving.
3. Those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will
not come upon us.” Say, “Yes indeed, by my
Lord, it will come upon you. He is the
Knower of the unseen.” Not an atom's weight
in the heavens and the earth, or anything
smaller or larger, escapes His knowledge. All
are in a Clear Record.
4. That He may recompense those who believe
and do good works. Those will have for-
giveness, and a generous provision.
5. As for those who strive against Our revela-
tions, seeking to undermine them—for them
is a punishment of a painful plague.
6. Those who received knowledge know that
what is revealed to you from your Lord is the
truth; and it guides to the path of the Majes-
tic, the Praiseworthy.
7. Those who disbelieved said, “Shall we point
out to you a man, who will tell you that, once
torn into shreds, you will be in a new crea-
tion?
8. Did he invent a lie about Allah, or is there
madness in him?” Indeed, those who do not
believe in the Hereafter are in torment, and
far astray.
9. Do they not reflect upon what lies before
them and behind them, of the heaven and the
earth? If We will, We can make the earth cave
in beneath them, or make pieces of the sky
fall down on them. In that is a sign for every
devout servant.
10. We bestowed upon David favor from Us:
“O mountains, and birds: echo with him.”
And We softened iron for him.
11. “Make coats of armor, and measure the
links well; and work righteousness. I am Ob-
servant of everything you do.”
12. And for Solomon the wind—its outward
journey was one month, and its return jour-
ney was one month. And We made a spring
of tar flow for him. And there were sprites
that worked under him, by the leave of his
Lord. But whoever of them swerved from
Our command, We make him taste of the
punishment of the Inferno.
13. They made for him whatever he wished:
sanctuaries, statues, bowls like pools, and
heavy cauldrons. “O House of David, work
with appreciation,” but a few of My servants
are appreciative.
14. Then, when We decreed death for him,
nothing indicated his death to them except an
earthworm eating at his staff. Then, when he
fell down, it became clear to the sprites that,
had they known the unseen, they would not
have remained in the demeaning torment.
15. In Sheba’s homeland there used to be a
wonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the
left. “Eat of your Lord’s provision, and give
thanks to Him.” A good land, and a forgiving
Lord.
16134. SHEBA (Saba’)
But they turned away, so We unleashed
against them the flood of the dam; and We
substituted their two gardens with two gar-
dens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and mea-
ger harvest.
17. We thus penalized them for their ingrati-
tude. Would We penalize any but the un-
grateful?
18. Between them and the towns We had
blessed, We placed prominent towns, and
We made the travel between them easy.
“Travel between them by night and day, in
safety.”
19. But they said, “Our Lord, lengthen the dis-
tances of our journeys.” They wronged them-
selves; so We made them history, and We
scattered them in every direction. In this are
lessons for every steadfast and appreciative
person.
20. Satan was correct in his assessment of
them. They followed him, except for a group
of believers.
21. He had no authority over them; except that
We willed to distinguish him who believes in
the Hereafter, from him who is doubtful
about it. Your Lord is Guardian over all
things.
22. Say, “Call upon those whom you claim be-
sides Allah. They possess not an atom's
weight in the heavens or the earth, and they
possess no share of either, and He has no
backers from among them.”
23. Intercession with Him is of no value, ex-
cept for someone He has permitted. Until,
when fear has subsided from their hearts,
they will say, “What did your Lord say?” They
will say, “The truth, and He is the High, the
Great.”
24. Say, “Who provides for you from the heav-
ens and the earth?” Say, “Allah. And Either
you, or we, are rightly guided, or in evident
error.”
25. Say, “You will not be asked about our mis-
deeds, nor will we be asked about what you
do.”
16.
26. Say, “Our Lord will bring us together; then
He will judge between us equitably. He is the
All-Knowing Judge.”
27. Say, “Show me those you have attached to
Him as associates. No indeed! But He is Al-
lah, the Powerful, the Wise.”
28. We sent you only universally to all people,
a herald and warner, but most people do not
know.
29. And they say, “When is this promise due,
if you are truthful?”
30. Say, “You are promised a Day, which you
cannot postpone by one hour, nor bring for-
ward.”
31. Those who disbelieve say, “We will never
believe in this Quran, nor in what came be-
fore it.” If you could only see the wrongdoers,
captive before their Lord, throwing back alle-
gations at one another. Those who were op-
pressed will say to those who were arrogant,
“Were it not for you, we would have been be-
lievers.”
32. Those who were arrogant will say to those
who were oppressed, “Was it us who turned
you away from guidance when it came to
you? No indeed, you yourselves were sinful.”
33. And those who were oppressed will say to
those who were arrogant, “It was your
scheming by night and day; as you instructed
us to reject Allah, and to set up rivals to Him.”
They will hide their remorse when they see
the retribution. We will put yokes around the
necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be
repaid for anything other than what they
used to do?
34. We sent no warner to any town, without its
affluent saying, “We reject what you are sent
with.”
35. And they say, “We have more wealth and
more children, and we will not be punished.”
36. Say, “My Lord spreads out His bounty to
whomever He wills, or restricts it; but most
people do not know.”
37. It is neither your wealth nor your children
that bring you closer to Us, but it is he who
16235. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)
believes and does good deeds. These will have
a double reward for what they did; and they
will reside in the Chambers, in peace and se-
curity.
38. But those who work against Our revela-
tions, seeking to undermine them—those will
be summoned to the punishment.
39. Say, “My Lord extends the provision to
whomever He wills of His servants, or with-
holds it. Anything you spend, He will replace
it. He is the Best of providers.”
40. On the Day when He gathers them all to-
gether, then say to the angels, “Was it you
these used to worship?”
41. They will say, “Be You glorified; You are
our Master, not them. In fact, they used to
worship the jinn, and most of them had faith
in them.”
42. “Today, none of you has the power to
profit or harm the other.” And We will say to
those who did wrong, “Taste the agony of the
Fire which you used to deny.”
43. And when Our enlightening Verses are re-
cited to them, they say, “This is nothing but a
man who wants to divert you from what your
ancestors used to worship.” And they say,
“This is nothing but a fabricated lie.” And
when the Truth comes to them, the blas-
phemers say of the Truth, “This is nothing
but plain magic.”
44. But We gave them no book to study, and
We did not send them any warner before you.
45. Those before them also denied the Truth,
yet they have not attained one-tenth of what
We had given them. They rejected My mes-
sengers, so how was My disapproval?
46. Say, “I offer you a single advice: devote
yourselves to Allah, in pairs, or individually;
and reflect. There is no madness in your
friend. He is just a warner to you, before the
advent of a severe punishment.”
47. Say, “Whatever compensation I have asked
of you, is yours. My compensation comes
only from Allah, and He is Witness over all
things.”
48. Say,
“My Lord projects the truth. He is the
Knower of the Unseen.”
49. Say, “The Truth has come; while falsehood
can neither originate, nor regenerate.”
50. Say, “If I err, I err only to my own loss; but
if I am guided, it is by what my Lord inspires
me. He is Hearing and Near.”
51. If you could only see when they are terri-
fied, and there is no escape, and they are
seized from a nearby place.
52. And they say, “We have believed in it.” But
how can they attain it from a distant place?
53. They have rejected it in the past, and made
allegations from a far-off place.
54. A barrier will be placed between them and
what they desire, as was done formerly with
their counterparts. They were in disturbing
doubt.
35. ORIGINATOR
(Fatir)

1. Praise be to Allah, Originator
of the heavens
and the earth, Maker of the angels messen-
gers with wings—double, triple, and quadru-
ple. He adds to creation as He wills. Allah is
Able to do all things.
2. Whatever mercy Allah unfolds for the peo-
ple, none can withhold it. And if He with-
holds it, none can release it thereafter. He is
the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.
3. O people! Remember Allah’s blessings
upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah
who provides for you from the heaven and
the earth? There is no god but He. So how are
you misled?
4. If they reject you, messengers before you
were also rejected. To Allah all matters are re-
turned.
5. O people! The promise of Allah is true; so
let not the lowly life seduce you, and let not
the Tempter tempt you away from Allah.
16335. ORIGINATOR (Fatir)
6. Satan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an
enemy. He only invites his gang to be among
the inmates of the Inferno.
7. Those who disbelieve will suffer a harsh
punishment, but those who believe and do
righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a
great reward.
8. What of him whose evil deed was made at-
tractive to him, and so he regards it as good?
Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and He
guides whomever He wills. Therefore, do not
waste yourself sorrowing over them. Allah
knows exactly what they do.
9. Allah is He who sends the winds, which ag-
itate clouds, which We drive to a dead land,
and thereby revive the ground after it had
died. Likewise is the Resurrection.
10. Whoever desires honor—all honor belongs
to Allah. To Him ascends speech that is pure,
and He elevates righteous conduct. As for
those who plot evil, a terrible punishment
awaits them, and the planning of these will
fail.
11. Allah created you from dust, then from a
small drop; then He made you pairs. No fe-
male conceives, or delivers, except with His
knowledge. No living thing advances in years,
or its life is shortened, except it be in a Rec-
ord. That is surely easy for Allah.
12. The two seas are not the same. One is fresh,
sweet, good to drink, while the other is salty
and bitter. Yet from each you eat tender meat,
and extract jewelry which you wear. And you
see the ships plowing through them, so that
you may seek of His bounty, so that you may
give thanks.
13. He merges the night into the day, and He
merges the day into the night; and He regu-
lates the sun and the moon, each running for
a stated term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is
the sovereignty. As for those you call upon
besides Him, they do not possess a speck.
14. If you pray to them, they cannot hear your
prayer. And even if they heard, they would
not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrec-
tion, they will reject your partnership. None
informs you like an Expert.
15. O people! It is you who are the poor, in
need of Allah; while Allah is the Rich, the
Praiseworthy.
16. If He wills, He can do away with you, and
produce a new creation.
17. And
that would not be difficult for Allah.
burdened soul can carry the burden of
another. Even if one weighted down calls for
help with its burden, nothing can be lifted
from it, even if they were related. You are to
warn those who fear their Lord inwardly, and
perform the prayer. He who purifies himself
purifies himself for his own good. To Allah is
the ultimate return.
18. No
19. Not equal are the blind and the seeing.
20. Nor are the darkness and the light.
21. Nor are the shade and the torrid heat.
22. Nor are equal the living and the dead. Allah
causes whomever He wills to hear, but you
cannot make those in the graves hear.
23. You
are only a warner.
We sent you with the truth; a bearer of
good news, and a warner. There is no com-
munity but a warner has passed through it.
25. If they disbelieve you, those before them
also disbelieved. Their messengers came to
them with the clear proofs, with the Psalms,
and with the Enlightening Scripture.
26. Then I seized those who disbelieved—so
how was My rejection?
27. Have you not seen that Allah sends down
water from the sky? With it We produce
fruits of various colors. And in the mountains
are streaks of white and red—varying in their
hue—and pitch-black.
28. Likewise, human beings, animals, and live-
stock come in various colors. From among
His servants, the learned fear Allah. Allah is
Almighty, Oft-Forgiving.
29. Those who recite the Book of Allah, and
perform the prayer, and spend of what We
24.
16436. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
have provided for them, secretly and pub-
licly, expect a trade that will not fail.
30. He will pay them their dues in full, and will
increase them from His bounty. He is Forgiv-
ing and Appreciative.
31. What We inspired in you, of the Book, is
the truth, confirming what preceded it. Allah
is Well-Informed of His servants, All-Seeing.
32. Then We passed the Book to those of Our
servants whom We chose. Some of them
wrong their souls, and some follow a middle
course, and some are in the foremost in good
deeds by Allah’s leave; that is the greatest
blessing.
33. The Gardens of Eden, which they will en-
ter. They will be adorned therein with gold
bracelets and pearls, and their garments
therein will be of silk.
34. And they will say, “Praise Allah, who has
lifted all sorrow from us. Our Lord is Most
Forgiving, Most Appreciative.
35. He Who settled us in the Home of Perma-
nence, by His grace, where boredom will not
touch us, and fatigue will not afflict us.”
36. As for those who disbelieve, for them is the
Fire of Hell, wherein they will never be fin-
ished off and die, nor will its punishment be
lightened for them. Thus We will repay every
ingrate.
37. And they will scream therein, “Our Lord,
let us out, and we will act righteously, differ-
ently from the way we used to act.” Did We
not give you a life long enough, in which an-
yone who wanted to understand would have
understood? And the warner did come to
you. So taste. The evildoers will have no
helper.
38. Allah is the Knower of the future of the
heavens and the earth. He knows what the
hearts contain.
39. It is He who made you successors on earth.
Whoever disbelieves, his disbelief will recoil
upon him. The disbelief of the disbelievers
adds only to their Lord's disfavor of them.
The disbelief of the disbelievers adds only to
their perdition.
40. Say, “Have you considered those partners
of yours that you worship instead of Allah?
Show me what they have created on earth. Or
do they have any share in the heavens?” Or
have We given them a book whose clear
teachings they follow? In fact, the wrongdo-
ers promise one another nothing but delu-
sions.
41. Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest
they fall apart. And were they to fall apart,
there is none to hold them together except
He. He is Most Clement, Most Forgiving.
42. And they swore by Allah with their solemn
oaths, that if a warner came to them, they
would be more guided than any other people.
Yet when a warner came to them, it only in-
creased them in aversion.
43. Priding themselves on earth, and scheming
evil. But evil scheming overwhelms none but
its authors. Do they expect anything but the
precedent of the ancients? You will not find
any change in Allah’s practice, and you will
not find any substitute to Allah’s practice.
44. Have they not journeyed in the land and
observed the fate of those who preceded
them? They were superior to them in
strength. But nothing can defeat Allah in the
heavens or on Earth. He is indeed Omnisci-
ent and Omnipotent.
45. If Allah were to punish the people for what
they have earned, He would not leave a single
living creature on its surface. But He defers
them until a stated time. Then, when their
time has arrived—Allah is Observant of His
creatures.

a straight path.
The revelation of the Almighty, the Merci-
ful.
6. To warn a people whose ancestors were not
warned, and so they are unaware.
7. The Word was realized against most of
them, for they do not believe.
8. We placed shackles around their necks, up
to their chins, so they are stiff-necked.
9. And We placed a barrier in front of them,
and a barrier behind them, and We have en-
shrouded them, so they cannot see.
10. It is the same for them, whether you warn
them, or do not warn them—they will not be-
lieve.
11. You warn only him who follows the Mes-
sage, and fears the Most Gracious inwardly.
So give him good news of forgiveness, and a
generous reward.
12. It is We who revive the dead; and We write
down what they have forwarded, and their
traces. We have tallied all things in a Clear
Record.
13. And cite for them the parable of the landlords of the town—when the messengers
came to it.

14. We sent them two messengers, but they denied them both, so We reinforced them with
a third. They said, “We are messengers to you.”
15. They said, “You are nothing but humans like us, and the Gracious did not send down
anything; you are only lying.”

16. They said, “Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you.
17. And our only duty is clear communication.”
18. They said, “We see an evil omen in you; if
you do not give up, we will stone you, and a
painful punishment from us will befall you.”
5.
19. They said, “Your evil omen is upon you. Is
it because you were reminded? But you are an
extravagant people.”
20. Then a man came running from the remot-
est part of the city. He said, “O my people,
follow the messengers.
21. Follow those who ask you of no wage, and
are themselves guided.
22. “And why should I not worship Him Who
created me, and to Whom you will be re-
turned?
23. Shall I take other gods instead of Him? If
the Merciful desires harm for me, their inter-
cession will not avail me at all, nor will they
save me.
24. In
that case, I would be completely lost.
I have believed in your Lord, so listen to
me.”
26. It was said, “Enter Paradise.” He said, “If
only my people knew.
27. How my Lord has forgiven me, and made
me one of the honored.”
28. After him, We sent down no hosts from
heaven to his people; nor would We ever send
any down.
25.
29. It
was just one Cry, and they were stilled.
Alas for the servants. No messenger ever
came to them, but they ridiculed him.
31. Have they not considered how many gen-
erations We destroyed before them; and that
unto them they will not return?
32. All of them, every single one of them, will
be arraigned before Us.
33. And there is a sign for them in the dead
land: We give it life, and produce from it
grains from which they eat.
34. And We place in it gardens of palm-trees
and vines, and cause springs to gush out of it.
35. That they may eat from its fruits, although
their hands did not make it. Will they not be
appreciative?
30.
16636. YA-SEEN (Ya-Seen)
36. Glory be to Him who created all the pairs;
of what the earth produces, and of their own
selves, and of what they do not know.
37. Another sign for them is the night: We
strip the day out of it—and they are in dark-
ness.
38. And the sun runs towards its destination.
Such is the design of the Almighty, the All-
Knowing.
39. And the moon: We have disposed it in
phases, until it returns like the old twig.
40. The sun is not to overtake the moon, nor is
the night to outpace the day. Each floats in an
orbit.
41. Another sign for them is that We carried
their offspring in the laden Ark.
42. And We created for them the like of it, in
which they ride.
43. If We will, We can drown them—with no
screaming to be heard from them, nor will
they be saved.
44. Except by a mercy from Us, and enjoyment
for a while.
45. Yet when it is said to them, “Beware of
what lies before you, and what lies behind
you, that you may receive mercy.”
46. Yet never came to them a sign of their
Lord’s signs, but they turned away from it.
47. And when it is said to them, “Spend of
what Allah has provided for you,” those who
disbelieve say to those who believe, “Shall we
feed someone whom Allah could feed, if He
so willed? You must be deeply misguided.”
48. And they say, “When will this promise be,
if you are truthful?”
49. All they can expect is a single blast, which
will seize them while they feud.
50. They will not be able to make a will, nor
will they return to their families.
51. The Trumpet will be blown, then behold,
they will rush from the tombs to their Lord.
52. They will say, “Woe to us! Who resurrected
us from our resting-place?” This is what the
Most Gracious had promised, and the mes-
sengers have spoken the truth.”
53. It will be but a single scream; and behold,
they will all be brought before Us.
54. On that Day, no soul will be wronged in the
least, and you will be recompensed only for
what you used to do.
55. The inhabitants of Paradise, on that Day,
will be happily busy.
56. They and their spouses, in shades, reclin-
ing on couches.
57. They will have therein fruits. They will
have whatever they call for.
58. Peace—a saying from a Most Merciful
Lord.
59. But
step aside today, you criminals.
O Children of
Adam, that you shall not serve the devil? That
he is your sworn enemy?
61. And that you shall serve Me? This is a
straight path.
62. He has misled a great multitude of you. Did
you not understand?
60. Did I not covenant with you,
63. This
is Hellfire, which you were promised.
Roast in it today, because you persistently
disbelieved.
65. On this Day, We will seal their mouths, and
their hands will speak to Us, and their feet
will testify to everything they had done.
66. If We will, We can blind their eyes as they
rush towards the path—but how will they
see?
67. And if We will, We can cripple them in
their place; so they can neither move forward,
nor go back.
68. Whomever We grant old age, We reverse
his development. Do they not understand?
69. We did not teach him poetry, nor is it
proper for him. It is only a reminder, and a
Clear Quran.
70. That he may warn whoever is alive, and
prove the Word against the faithless.
64.
16737. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
Have they not seen that We created for
them, of Our Handiwork, livestock that they
own?
72. And We subdued them for them. Some
they ride, and some they eat.
73. And they have in them other benefits, and
drinks. Will they not give thanks?
74. Yet they have taken to themselves gods
other than Allah, that perhaps they may be
helped.
75. They cannot help them, although they are
arrayed as troops for them.
76. So let their words not sadden you. We
know what they conceal, and what they re-
veal.
77. Does the human being not consider that
We created him from a seed? Yet he becomes
a fierce adversary.
78. And he produces arguments against Us,
and he forgets his own creation. He says,
“Who will revive the bones when they have
decayed?”
79. Say, “He who initiated them in the first in-
stance will revive them. He has knowledge of
every creation.”
80. He who produced fuel for you from the
green trees, with which you kindle a fire.
81. Is not He who created the heavens and the
earth able to create the like of them? Cer-
tainly. He is the Supreme All-Knowing Crea-
tor.
82. His command, when He wills a thing, is to
say to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.
83. So glory be to Him in whose hand is the
dominion of everything, and to Him you will
be returned.

We drowned the others.
83. Of
his kind was Abraham.
When he came to his Lord with a sound
heart.
85. He said to his father and his people, “What
are you worshiping?
86. Is it falsified gods, instead of Allah, that you
want?
87. So what is your opinion about the Lord of
the Worlds?”
84.
88. Then
he took a glance at the stars.
89. And
said, “I am sick.”
90. But they turned their backs on him, and
went away.
91. Then he turned to their gods, and said,
“will you not eat?
92. What is it with you, that you do not speak?”
93. Then
he turned on them, striking with his
right hand.
94. And
they came running towards him.
95. He
said, “Do you worship what you carve?
When Allah created you, and what you
manufacture?”
97. They said, “Build a pyre for him, and throw
him into the furnace.”
98. They wished him ill, but We made them
the losers.
99. He said, “I am going towards my Lord, and
He will guide me.”
96.
100. “My
Lord, give me one of the righteous.”
So We gave him good news of a clement
boy.
102. Then, when he was old enough to accom-
pany him, he said, “O My son, I see in a
dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you
think.” He said, “O my Father, do as you are
commanded; you will find me, Allah willing,
one of the steadfast.”
103. Then, when they had submitted, and he
put his forehead down.
101.
called out to him, “O Abraham!
105. You have fulfilled the vision.” Thus We re-
ward the doers of good.
106. This

was certainly an evident test.
We redeemed him with a great sacri-
fice.
108. And We left with him for later genera-
tions.
109. Peace
110. Thus
be upon Abraham.
We reward the doers of good.
111. He
was one of Our believing servants.
And We gave him good news of Isaac, a
prophet, one of the righteous.
113. And We blessed him, and Isaac. But
among their descendants are some who are
righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to
themselves.
112.
114. And
We blessed Moses and Aaron.
And We delivered them and their people
from the terrible disaster.
116. And We supported them, and so they were
the victors.
117. And We gave them the Clarifying Scrip-
ture.
118. And We guided them upon the straight
path.
119. And We left with them for later genera-
tions.
115.
120. Peace
be upon Moses and Aaron.
121. Thus We reward the righteous.
122. They were of Our believing servants.
17037. THE ALIGNERS (as-Saffat)
123. Also
Elijah was one of the messengers.
124. He
said to his people, “Do you not fear?
Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best
of creators?
126. Allah is your Lord, and the Lord of your
ancestors.”
127. But they called him a liar, and thus they
will be brought forward.

144. He would have stayed in its belly until the
Day they are raised.
145. Then We threw him into the wilderness,
and he was sick.
146. And We made a gourd tree grow over him.
147. Then We sent him to a hundred thousand,
or more.

38. SAAD
(Saad)

1. Saad.
By the renowned Quran.
Those who disbelieve are steeped in arro-
gance and defiance.
3. How many generations have We destroyed
before them? They cried out when it was too
late to escape.
4. And they marveled that a warner has come
to them from among them. The disbelievers
said, “This is a lying magician.”
5. “Did he turn all the gods into one God? This
is something strange.”
6. The notables among them announced: “Go
on, and hold fast to your gods. This is some-
thing planned.
7. We never heard of this in the former faith.
This is nothing but a fabrication.
8. Was the message sent down to him, out of
all of us?” In fact, they are doubtful of My
warning. In fact, they have not yet tasted My
punishment.
9. Or do they possess the treasuries of the
mercy of your Lord—the Majestic, the Giver?
10. Or do they possess the sovereignty of the
heavens and the earth and what is between
them? Then let them ascend the ropes.
11. An army of confederates will be defeated
there.
2.
12. Before
them the people of Noah denied the
truth; as did Aad, and Pharaoh of the Stakes.
13. And Thamood, and the people of Lot, and
the dwellers of the Woods—these were the
confederates.
14. None of them but denied the messengers,
so My retribution was deserved.
15. These can expect only a single scream,
from which there is no recovery.
16. And they say, “Our Lord, hasten Your writ
upon us, before the Day of Account.”
17. Be patient in the face of what they say, and
mention Our servant David, the resourceful.
He was obedient.
18. We committed the mountains to glorify
with him, in the evening and at daybreak.
19. And the birds, gathered together. All obe-
dient to him.
20. And We strengthened his kingdom, and
gave him wisdom and decisive speech.
21. Has the story of the two disputants reached
you? When they scaled the sanctuary?
22. When they entered upon David, and he
was startled by them. They said, “Do not fear.
Two disputants; one of us has wronged the
other; so judge between us fairly, and do not
be biased, and guide us to the straight way.”
23. “This brother of mine has ninety nine
ewes, and I have one ewe, and he said, ‘En-
trust it to me,’ and he pressured me with
words.”
24. He said, “He has done you wrong by asking
your ewe in addition to his ewes. Many part-
ners take advantage of one another, except
those who believe and do good deeds, but
these are so few.” David realized that We
were testing him, so he sought forgiveness
from his Lord, and fell down to his knees, and
repented.
25. So We forgave him that. And for him is
nearness to Us, and a good place of return.
26. “O David, We made you a ruler in the land,
so judge between the people with justice, and
do not follow desire, lest it diverts you from
17238. SAAD (Saad)
Allah’s path. Those who stray from Allah’s
path will have a painful punishment, for hav-
ing ignored the Day of Account.”
27. We did not create the heaven and the earth
and everything between them in vain. That is
the assumption of those who disbelieve—so
woe to those who disbelieve because of the
Fire.
28. Or are We to treat those who believe and
do righteous deeds like those who make trou-
ble on earth? Or are We to treat the pious like
the shameless?
29. A blessed Book that We sent down to you,
that they may ponder its Verses, and for those
with intelligence to take heed.
30. And We granted David, Solomon, an ex-
cellent servant. He was penitent.
31. When the beautiful horses were paraded
before him in the evening.
32. He said, “I have preferred the love of nice-
ties to the remembrance of my Lord—until it
disappeared behind the veil.
33. Bring them back to me.” And he began ca-
ressing their legs and necks.
34. We tested Solomon, and placed a body on
his throne; then he repented.
35. He said, “My Lord, forgive me, and grant
me a kingdom never to be attained by anyone
after me. You are the Giver.”
36. So We placed the wind at his service, blow-
ing gently by his command, wherever he di-
rected.
37. And
38. And
the demons—every builder and diver.
others fettered in chains.
“This is Our gift; so give generously, or
withhold; without account.”
40. For him is nearness to Us, and a beautiful
resort.
41. And mention Our servant Job, when he
called out to his Lord, “Satan has afflicted me
with hardship and pain.”
42. “Stamp with your foot—here is cool water
to wash with, and to drink.”
39.
And We restored his family for him, and
their like with them; as a mercy from Us, and
a lesson for those who possess insight.
44. “Take with your hand a bundle, and strike
with it, and do not break your oath.” We
found him patient. What an excellent serv-
ant! He was obedient.
45. And mention Our servants Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob—endowed with ability and
vision.
46. We distinguished them with a distinct
quality: the remembrance of the Home.
47. To Us they are among the chosen, the out-
standing.
48. And mention Ishmael, Elisha, and Ezekiel;
all are among the outstanding.
49. This is a reminder. The devout will have a
good place of return.
50. The Gardens of Eden, with their doors
wide-open for them.
51. Relaxing therein, and calling for abundant
fruit and beverage.
52. With them will be attendants with modest
gaze, of same age.
53. This is what you are promised for the Day
of Account.
43.
54. Such
is Our bounty, inexhaustible.
All This. But the transgressors will have a
miserable return.
56. Hell; in which they will roast; what a mis-
erable abode!
57. All this. Let them taste it—boiling and bit-
ter cold.
55.
58. And
similar torments of diverse kinds.
“This is a crowd rushing headlong with
you.” There is no welcome for them. They
will be scorched by the Fire.
60. They will say, “But it is you! There is no
welcome for you! It is you who brought it
upon us! What a miserable end!”
61. They will say, “Our Lord, whoever brought
this upon us, give him double torment in the
Fire.”
59.
17339. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
62. And they will say, “What is it with us that
we do not see men we used to count among
the wicked?
63. Did we take them for mockery, or have our
eyes swerved from them?
64. This is certainly true—the feuding of the
people of the Fire.
65. Say, “I am only a warner, and there is no
god except Allah—the One, the Conqueror.
66. The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and
everything between them; the Mighty, the
Forgiver.”
67. Say,
“It is a message of great importance.
68. From

them all.

of them who follows you.”

which you are turning away.
39. THRONGS
(az-Zumar)
69. I have no knowledge of the Highest Assem-
bly as they dispute.
70. It is only revealed to me that I am a clear
warner.”
71. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating
a human being from clay.
72. When I have formed him, and breathed
into him of My spirit, fall prostrate before
him.
73. So
the angels fell prostrate, all of them.
Except for Satan. He was too proud, and
one of the faithless.
75. He said, “O Satan, what prevented you
from prostrating before what I created with
My Own hands? Are you too proud, or were
you one of the exalted?”
76. He said, “I am better than he; You created
me from fire, and You created him from
clay.”
77. He said, “Then get out of here! You are an
outcast!
78. And My curse will be upon you until the
Day of Judgment.”
79. He said, “Lord, defer me until the Day they
are resurrected.”
74.
80. He
said, “You are one of those deferred.
81. Until
the Day of the Time Appointed.”

1. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the
Mighty and Wise.
We sent down to you the Book with the
truth, so serve Allah, devoting your religion
to Him.
3. Is not to Allah that sincere faith is due? As
for those who take guardians besides Him,
“We only worship them that they may bring
us nearer to Allah.” Allah will judge between
them regarding their differences. Allah does
not guide the lying blasphemer.
4. If Allah wanted to have a son, He could have
selected from His creation at will. Glory be to
Him. He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing.
5. He created the heavens and the earth with
reason. He wraps the night around the day,
and He wraps the day around the night. And
He regulates the sun and the moon, each run-
ning along a specific course. He is indeed the
Almighty, the Forgiver.
6. He created you from one person, then made
from it its mate, and brought down livestock
for you—eight kinds in pairs. He creates you
in the wombs of your mothers, in successive
2.
17439. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
formations, in a triple darkness. Such is Al-
lah, your Lord. His is the kingdom. There is
no god but He. So what made you deviate?
7. If you disbelieve, Allah is Independent of
you, yet He does not approve ingratitude on
the part of His servants. And if you are thank-
ful, He will approve that in you. No bearer of
burden can bear the burden of another. Then
to your Lord is your return; and He will in-
form you of what you used to do. He is aware
of what the hearts contain.
8. When some adversity touches the human
being, he prays to his Lord, repenting to Him.
But then, when He confers on him a grace of
His, he forgets what he was praying for be-
fore, and he attributes rivals to Allah, in order
to lead astray from His way. Say, “Enjoy your
disbelief for a little while; you will be among
the inmates of the Fire.”
9. Is he who worships devoutly during the
watches of the night, prostrating himself and
standing up, mindful of the Hereafter, and
placing his hope in the mercy of his Lord?
Say, “Are those who know and those who do
not know equal?” Only those possessed of
reason will remember.
10. Say, “O My devotees who have believed,
keep your duty to your Lord. For those who
do good in this world, is goodness. And Al-
lah’s earth is vast. The steadfast will be paid
their wages in full, without reckoning.”
11. Say, “I was commanded to serve Allah, de-
voting my religion exclusively to Him.
12. And I was commanded to be the first of
those who submit.”
13. Say, “I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the
punishment of a horrendous Day.”
14. Say, “It is Allah I worship, sincere in my
faith in Him.”
15. “But you can worship whatever you wish
besides Him.” Say, “The losers are those who
lose their souls and their people on the Day
of Resurrection.” That is indeed the obvious
loss.
16. They will have layers of Fire above them,
and layers beneath them. That is how Allah
strikes fear into His servants—“O My serv-
ants! Beware of Me!”
17. As for those who avoid the worship of
idols, and devote themselves to Allah—theirs
is the good news. So give good news to My
servants.
18. Those who listen to the Word, and follow
the best of it. These are they whom Allah has
guided. These are they who possess intellect.
19. What about someone who has deserved the
sentence of punishment? Is it you who can
save those in the Fire?
20. But those who fear their Lord will have
mansions upon mansions, built high, with
streams flowing beneath them. The promise
of Allah; and Allah never breaks a promise.
21. Have you not considered how Allah sends
down water from the sky, then He makes it
flow into underground wells, then He pro-
duces with it plants of various colors, then
they wither and you see them yellowing, then
He turns them into debris? Surely in this is a
reminder for those with understanding.
22. What about someone whose heart Allah
has opened to Islam, so that he follows a light
from His Lord? Woe to those whose hearts
are hardened against the mention of Allah.
Those are in manifest error.
23. Allah has sent down the best of narrations:
a Scripture consistent and paired. The skins
of those who reverence their Lord shiver
from it, then their skins and their hearts sof-
ten up to the remembrance of Allah. Such is
Allah’s guidance; He guides with it whom-
ever He wills. But whomever Allah leaves
astray, for him there is no guide.
24. What about someone who covers his face
against the terrible misery of the Day of Res-
urrection? To the evildoers it will be said,
“Taste what you used to earn.”
25. Those before them also denied the truth, so
the penalty came upon them from where they
did not perceive.
17539. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
26. Allah made them taste disgrace in the pre-
sent life, but the punishment of the Hereafter
is worse, if they only knew.
27. We have cited in this Quran for mankind
every ideal, that they may take heed.
28. An Arabic Quran, without any defect, so
they may become righteous.
29. Allah cites the example of a man shared by
partners at odds, and a man belonging exclu-
sively to one man. Are they equal in status?
Praise be to Allah, but most of them do not
know.
30. You
will die, and they will die.
on the Day of Resurrection, you will
be quarrelling before your Lord.
32. Who is more evil than he who lies about
Allah, and denies the truth when it has come
to him? Is there not in Hell room for the un-
grateful?
33. But he who promotes the truth, and testi-
fies to it—these are the righteous.
34. They will have whatever they please with
their Lord. Such is the reward for the virtu-
ous.
35. Allah will acquit them of the worst of their
deeds, and will reward them according to the
best of what they used to do.
36. Is Allah not enough for His servant? And
they frighten you with those besides Him.
Whomever Allah sends astray, for him there
is no guide.
37. And whomever Allah guides, for him there
is no misleader. Is Allah not Powerful and
Vengeful?
38. And if you asked them, “Who created the
heavens and the earth?” they would say, “Al-
lah.” Say, “Have you seen those you pray to
instead of Allah? If Allah willed any harm for
me, can they lift His harm? And if He willed
a blessing for me, can they hold back His
mercy?” Say, “Allah suffices for me. On Him
the reliant rely.”
39. Say: “O my people, work according to your
ability; and so will I. Then you will know.
31. Then,
40. Who will receive a humiliating punish-
ment, and on whom will fall a lasting tor-
ment.”
41. We sent down upon you the Book for man-
kind in truth. He who follows guidance does
so for the good of his soul. And he who strays
in error does so to its detriment. You are not
their overseer.
42. Allah takes the souls at the time of their
death, and those that have not died during
their sleep. He retains those for which He has
decreed death, and He releases the others un-
til a predetermined time. In that are signs for
people who reflect.
43. Or have they chosen intercessors other
than Allah? Say, “Even though they have no
power over anything, and are devoid of rea-
son?”
44. Say, “All intercession is up to Allah. To
Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and
the earth. Then to Him you will be returned.”
45. When Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts
of those who do not believe in the Hereafter
shrink with resentment. But when those
other than Him are mentioned, they become
filled with joy.
46. Say, “Our God, Initiator of the heavens and
the earth, Knower of all secrets and declara-
tions. You will judge between your servants
regarding what they had differed about.”
47. If those who did wrong owned everything
on earth, and the like of it with it, they would
redeem themselves with it from the terrible
suffering on the Day of Resurrection. But
there will appear to them from Allah what
they never anticipated.
48. There will appear to them the evils of their
deeds, and they will be surrounded by what
they used to ridicule.
49. When adversity touches the human being,
he calls on Us. But then, when We favor him
with a blessing from Us, he says, “I have at-
tained this by virtue of my knowledge.” How-
ever, it is a test, but most of them do not
know.
17639. THRONGS (az-Zumar)
Those before them said it, but what they
had earned did not avail them.
51. The evils of their deeds caught up with
them. And the wrongdoers among these will
also be afflicted by the evils of what they
earned, and they cannot prevent it.
52. Do they not know that Allah extends the
provision to whomever He wills, and con-
stricts it? In that are signs for people who be-
lieve.
53. Say, “O My servants who have transgressed
against themselves: do not despair of Allah’s
mercy, for Allah forgives all sins. He is indeed
the Forgiver, the Clement.”
54. And turn to your Lord, and submit to Him,
before the retribution comes upon you. Then
you will not be helped.
55. And follow the best of what was revealed to
you from your Lord, before the punishment
comes upon you suddenly, while you are un-
aware.
56. So that a soul may not say, “How sorry I
am, for having neglected my duty to Allah,
and for having been of the scoffers.”
57. Or say, “Had Allah guided me; I would
have been of the pious.”
58. Or say, when it sees the penalty, “If only I
had another chance, I would be of the virtu-
ous.”
59. Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you,
but you called them lies, turned arrogant, and
were of the faithless.
60. On the Day of Resurrection, you will see
those who told lies about Allah with their
faces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell
for the arrogant?
61. And Allah will save those who maintained
righteousness to their place of salvation. No
harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.
62. Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is
in Charge of all things.
63. To Him belong the reins of the heavens
and the earth. But those who blaspheme
50.
against the revelations of Allah—it is they
who are the losers.
64. Say, “Is it other than Allah you instruct me
to worship, you ignorant ones?”
65. It was revealed to you, and to those before
you, that if you idolize, your works will be in
vain, and you will be of the losers.
66. Rather, worship Allah, and be of the appre-
ciative.
67. They have not esteemed Allah as He ought
to be esteemed. The entire earth will be in His
grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the
heavens will be folded in His right. Immacu-
late is He, and Transcendent He is beyond the
associations they make.
68. And the Trumpet will be sounded, where-
upon everyone in the heavens and the earth
will be stunned, except whomever Allah wills.
Then it will be sounded another time, where-
upon they will rise up, looking on.
69. And the earth will shine with the Light of
its Lord; and the Book will be put in place;
and the prophets and the witnesses will be
brought in; and Judgment will be passed
among them equitably, and they will not be
wronged.
70. And every soul will be fully compensated
for what it had done. He is well aware of what
they do.
71. Those who disbelieved will be driven to
Hell in throngs. Until, when they have
reached it, and its gates are opened, its keep-
ers will say to them, “Did not messengers
from among you come to you, reciting to you
the revelations of your Lord, and warning
you of the meeting of this Day of yours?”
They will say, “Yes, but the verdict of punish-
ment is justified against the disbelievers.”
72. It will be said, “Enter the gates of Hell, to
abide therein eternally.” How wretched is the
destination of the arrogant.
73. And those who feared their Lord will be led
to Paradise in throngs. Until, when they have
reached it, and its gates are opened, its keep-
ers will say to them, “Peace be upon you, you

have been good, so enter it, to abide therein
eternally.”
74. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who
has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us
inherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we
please.” How excellent is the reward of the
workers.
75. And you will see the angels hovering
around the Throne, glorifying their Lord
with praise. And it will be judged between
them equitably, and it will be said, “Praise be
to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.”
40. FORGIVER
(Ghafir)

1. Ha,
Meem.
The sending down of the Scripture is from
Allah the Almighty, the Omniscient.
3. Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se-
vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty.
There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti-
mate return.
4. None argues against Allah’s revelations ex-
cept those who disbelieve. So do not be im-
pressed by their activities in the land.
5. Before them the people of Noah rejected the
truth, as did the confederates after them.
Every community plotted against their mes-
senger, to capture him. And they argued with
falsehood, to defeat with it the truth. But I
seized them. What a punishment it was!
6. Thus the sentence of your Lord became re-
alized against those who disbelieve, that they
are to be inmates of the Fire.
7. Those who carry the Throne, and those
around it, glorify their Lord with praise, and
believe in Him, and ask for forgiveness for
those who believe: “Our Lord, You have en-
compassed everything in mercy and
knowledge; so forgive those who repent and
follow Your path, and protect them from the
agony of the Blaze.
2.
8. And admit them, Our Lord, into the Gar-
dens of Eternity, which You have promised
them, and the righteous among their parents,
and their spouses, and their offspring. You
are indeed the Almighty, the Most Wise.
9. And shield them from the evil deeds.
Whomever You shield from the evil deeds,
on that Day, You have had mercy on him.
That is the supreme achievement.”
10. Those who disbelieved will be addressed,
“The loathing of Allah is greater than your
loathing of yourselves—for you were invited
to the faith, but you refused.”
11. They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die
twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we
acknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?”
12. That is because when Allah alone was
called upon, you disbelieved; but when others
were associated with Him, you believed.
Judgment rests with Allah the Sublime, the
Majestic.
13. It is He who shows you His wonders, and
sends down sustenance from the sky for you.
But none pays heed except the repentant.
14. So call upon Allah, with sincere devotion to
Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.
15. Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He
conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon
whomever He wills of His servants, to warn
of the Day of Encounter.
16. The Day when they will emerge, nothing
about them will be concealed from Allah. “To
whom does the sovereignty belong today?”
“To Allah, the One, the Irresistible.”
17. On that Day, every soul will be recom-
pensed for what it had earned. There will be
no injustice on that Day. Allah is quick to set-
tle accounts.
18. And warn them of the Day of Imminence,
when the hearts are at the throats, choking
them. The evildoers will have no intimate
friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed.
19. He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and
what the hearts conceal.
17840. FORGIVER (Ghafir)
Allah judges with justice, while those
whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge
with anything. It is Allah who is the Hearing,
the Seeing.
21. Have they not travelled through the earth,
and seen the consequences for those before
them? They were stronger than them, and
they left more impact on earth. But Allah
seized them for their sins, and they had no
defender against Allah.
22. That is because their messengers used to
come to them with clear proofs, but they dis-
believed, so Allah seized them. He is Strong,
Severe in retribution.
23. We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear
authority.
24. To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But
they said, “A lying sorcerer.”
25. Then, when he came to them with the truth
from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those
who have believed with him, and spare their
daughters.” But the scheming of the unbe-
lievers can only go astray.
26. Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kill Moses, and
let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may
change your religion, or spread disorder in
the land.”
27. Moses said, “I have sought the protection
of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant
who does not believe in the Day of Account.”
28. A believing man from Pharaoh's family,
who had concealed his faith, said, “Are you
going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is
Allah,’ and he has brought you clear proofs
from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying will
rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then
some of what he promises you will befall you.
Allah does not guide the extravagant im-
poster.
29. O my people! Yours is the dominion today,
supreme in the land; but who will help us
against Allah’s might, should it fall upon us?”
Pharaoh said, “I do not show you except what
I see, and I do not guide you except to the
path of prudence.”
20.
30. The one who had believed said, “O my peo-
ple, I fear for you the like of the day of the
confederates.
31. Like the fate of the people of Noah, and
Aad, and Thamood, and those after them. Al-
lah wants no injustice for the servants.
32. O my people, I fear for you the Day of Call-
ing Out.
33. The Day when you will turn and flee, hav-
ing no defender against Allah. Whomever Al-
lah misguides has no guide.”
34. Joseph had come to you with clear revela-
tions, but you continued to doubt what he
came to you with. Until, when he perished,
you said, “Allah will never send a messenger
after him.” Thus Allah leads astray the outra-
geous skeptic.
35. Those who argue against Allah’s revela-
tions, without any proof having come to
them—a heinous sin in the sight of Allah, and
of those who believe. Thus Allah seals the
heart of every proud bully.
36. And Pharaoh said, “O Hamaan, build me a
tower, that I may reach the pathways.
37. The pathways of the heavens, so that I may
glance at the God of Moses; though I think he
is lying.” Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were
made to appear good to him, and he was
averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was
only in defeat.
38. The one who had believed said, “O my peo-
ple, follow me, and I will guide you to the
path of rectitude.”
39. “O my people, the life of this world is noth-
ing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter
is the Home of Permanence.
40. Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only
with its like. But whoever works righteous-
ness, whether male or female, and is a be-
liever—these will enter Paradise, where they
will be provided for without account.
41. O my people, how is it that I call you to sal-
vation, and you call me to the Fire?
17940. FORGIVER (Ghafir)
42. You call me to reject Allah, and to associate
with Him what I have no knowledge of, while
I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.
43. Without a doubt, what you call me to has
no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and
our turning back is to Allah; and the trans-
gressors are the inmates of the Fire.
44. You will remember what I am telling you,
so I commit my case to Allah. Allah is Ob-
servant of the servants.”
45. So Allah protected him from the evils of
their scheming, while a terrible torment be-
sieged Pharaoh’s clan.
46. The Fire. They will be exposed to it morn-
ing and evening. And on the Day the Hour
takes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the
most intense agony.”
47. As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will
say to those who were arrogant, “We were
followers of yours; will you then spare us a
portion of the Fire?”
48. Those who were arrogant will say, “We are
all in it; Allah has judged between the serv-
ants.”
49. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers
of Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suf-
fering for one day.”
50. They will say, “Did not your messengers
come to you with clear signs?” They will say,
“Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the
prayers of the disbelievers will always be in
vain.”
51. Most surely We will support Our messen-
gers and those who believe, in this life, and on
the Day the witnesses arise.
52. The Day when their excuses will not profit
the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon
them, and they will have the Home of Misery.
53. We gave Moses guidance, and made the
Children of Israel inherit the Scripture.
54. A guide and a reminder for those endowed
with reason.
55. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true.
And ask forgiveness for your sin, and pro-
claim the praise of your Lord evening and
morning.
56. Those who dispute regarding Allah’s reve-
lations without any authority having come to
them—there is nothing in their hearts but the
feeling of greatness, which they will never at-
tain. So seek refuge in Allah; for He is the All-
Hearing, the All-Seeing.
57. Certainly the creation of the heavens and
the earth is greater than the creation of hu-
manity, but most people do not know.
58. Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor
are those who believe and work righteousness
equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.
59. Indeed, the Hour is coming; there is no
doubt about it; but most people do not be-
lieve.
60. Your Lord has said, “Pray to Me, and I will
respond to you. But those who are too proud
to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.”
61. It is Allah Who made the night for you, that
you may rest therein; and the day allowing
sight. Allah is gracious towards the people,
but most people do not give thanks.
62. Such is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all
things. There is no god except Him; so how
could you turn away?
63. Thus are turned away those who dispute
the signs of Allah.
64. It is Allah who made the earth a habitat for
you, and the sky a structure. And He de-
signed you, and designed you well; and He
provided you with the good things. Such is
Allah, your Lord; so Blessed is Allah, Lord of
the Worlds.
65. He is the Living One. There is no god ex-
cept He. So pray to Him, devoting your reli-
gion to Him. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of
the Worlds.
66. Say, “I was prohibited from worshiping
those you invoke besides Allah, now that
clear revelations have come to me from my
18041. DETAILED (Fussilat)
Lord; and I was commanded to submit to the
Lord of the Worlds.”
67. It is He who created you from dust, then
from a seed, then from an embryo, then He
brings you out as an infant, then He lets you
reach your maturity, then you become el-
derly—although some of you die sooner—so
that you may reach a predetermined age, so
that you may understand.
68. It is He who gives life and death; and when
He decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,”
and it comes to be.
69. Have you not observed those who dispute
regarding Allah's revelations, how they have
deviated?
70. Those who call the Book a lie, and what We
sent Our messengers with—they will surely
know.
71. When the yokes are around their necks,
and they will be dragged by the chains.
72. Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they
will be consumed.
73. Then it will be said to them, “Where are
those you used to deify?
74. Instead of Allah?” They will say, “They
have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying
to nothing before.” Thus Allah sends the dis-
believers astray.
75. That is because you used to rejoice on earth
in other than the truth, and because you used
to behave with vanity.
76. Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein
forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arro-
gant.
77. So be patient. The promise of Allah is true.
Whether We show you some of what We
have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us
they will be returned.
78. We sent messengers before you. Some of
them We told you about, and some We did
not tell you about. No messenger can bring a
miracle except by leave of Allah. Then, when
the command of Allah is issued, fair judg-
ment will be passed, and there and then the
seekers of vanity will lose.
79. Allah is He who created the domestic ani-
mals for you—some for you to ride, and some
you eat.
80. And in them you have other benefits as
well, and through them you satisfy your
needs. And on them, and on the ships, you
are transported.
81. And He shows you His signs. So which of
Allah’s signs will you deny?
82. Have they not journeyed through the land,
and seen the outcome for those before them?
They were more numerous than they, and
had greater power and influence in the land.
But what they had achieved availed them
nothing.
83. When their messengers came to them with
clear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge
they had, and the very things they used to rid-
icule besieged them.
84. Then, when they witnessed Our might,
they said, “We believe in Allah alone, and we
reject what we used to associate with Him.”
85. But their faith could not help them once
they witnessed Our might. This has been Al-
lah’s way of dealing with His servants. And
there and then the disbelievers lost.
41. DETAILED
(Fussilat)

1. Ha,
Meem.
A revelation from the Most Gracious, the
Most Merciful.
3. A Scripture whose Verses are detailed, a
Quran in Arabic for people who know.
4. Bringing good news, and giving warnings.
But most of them turn away, so they do not
listen.
5. And they say, “Our hearts are screened
from what you call us to, and in our ears is
deafness, and between us and you is a barrier.
So do what you want, and so will we.”
2.
18141. DETAILED (Fussilat)
6. Say, “I am only a human like you; it is in-
spired in me that your God is One God. So be
upright towards Him, and seek forgiveness
from Him.” And woe to the idolaters.
7. Those who do not pay the alms; and regard-
ing the Hereafter, they are disbelievers.
8. As for those who believe and do righteous
deeds—for them is a reward uninterrupted.
9. Say, “Do you reject the One who created the
earth in two days? And you attribute equals
to Him? That is the Lord of the Universe.”
10. He placed stabilizers over it; and blessed it;
and planned its provisions in four days,
equally to the seekers.
11. Then He turned to the sky, and it was
smoke, and said to it and to the earth, “Come,
willingly or unwillingly.” They said, “We
come willingly.”
12. So He completed them as seven universes
in two days, and He assigned to each universe
its laws. And We decorated the lower uni-
verse with lamps, and for protection. That is
the design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
13. But if they turn away, say, “I have warned
you of a thunderbolt, like the thunderbolt of
Aad and Thamood.”
14. Their messengers came to them, from be-
fore them and from behind them, saying, “Do
not worship anyone but Allah.” They said,
“Had our Lord willed, He would have sent
down angels; Therefore, we reject what you
are sent with.”
15. As for Aad, they turned arrogant on earth,
and opposed justice, and said, “Who is more
powerful than us?” Have they not considered
that Allah, who created them, is more power-
ful than they? And they went on denying Our
revelations.
16. So We unleashed upon them a screaming
wind, for a few miserable days, to make them
taste the punishment of shame in this life; but
the punishment of the Hereafter is more
shameful; and they will not be saved.
17. And as for Thamood, We guided them, but
they preferred blindness over guidance. So
the thunderbolt of the humiliating punish-
ment seized them, because of what they used
to earn.
18. And We saved those who believed and
were righteous.
19. The Day when Allah’s enemies are herded
into the Fire, forcibly.
20. Until, when they have reached it, their
hearing, and their sight, and their skins will
testify against them regarding what they used
to do.
21. And they will say to their skins, “Why did
you testify against us?” They will say, “Allah,
Who made all things speak, made us speak. It
is He who created you the first time, and to
Him you are returned.”
22. You were unable to hide yourselves from
your hearing, and your sight, and your skins,
to prevent them from testifying against you,
and you imagined that Allah was unaware of
much of what you do.
23. It is that thought of yours about your Lord
that led you to ruin—so you became of the
losers.
24. If they endure patiently, the Fire will be
their residence; and if they make up excuses,
they will not be pardoned.
25. We had assigned companions for them,
who glamorized to them what was in front of
them, and what was behind them. And the
Word proved true against them in communi-
ties of jinn and humans that have passed
away before them. They were losers.
26. Those who disbelieve say, “Do not listen to
this Quran, and talk over it, so that you may
prevail.”
27. We will make those who disbelieve taste an
intense agony, and We will recompense them
according to the worst of what they used to
do.
28. Such is the recompense of Allah’s ene-
mies—the Fire—where they will have their
permanent home, in recompense for having
disregarded Our revelations.
18241. DETAILED (Fussilat)
29. Those who disbelieved will say, “Our Lord,
show us those who led us astray—among jinn
and humans—and we will trample them un-
der our feet, so they become of the lowest.”
30. Surely, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah,”
and then go straight, the angels will descend
upon them: “Do not fear, and do not grieve,
but rejoice in the news of the Garden which
you were promised.
31. We are your allies in this life and in the
Hereafter, wherein you will have whatever
your souls desire, and you will have therein
whatever you call for.
32. As Hospitality from an All-Forgiving,
Merciful One.”
33. And who is better in speech than someone
who calls to Allah, and acts with integrity,
and says, “I am of those who submit”?
34. Good and evil are not equal. Repel evil with
good, and the person who was your enemy
becomes like an intimate friend.
35. But none will attain it except those who
persevere, and none will attain it except the
very fortunate.
36. When a temptation from the Devil pro-
vokes you, seek refuge in Allah; He is the
Hearer, the Knower.
37. And of His signs are the night and the day,
and the sun and the moon. Do not bow down
to the sun, nor to the moon, but bow down to
Allah, Who created them both, if it is Him
that you serve.
38. But if they are too proud—those in the
presence of your Lord praise Him night and
day, and without ever tiring.
39. And of His signs is that you see the land
still. But when We send down water upon it,
it stirs and grows. Surely, He Who revived it
will revive the dead. He is Able to do all
things.
40. Those who despise Our revelations are not
hidden from Us. Is he who is hurled into the
Fire better? Or he who arrives safely on the
Day of Resurrection? Do as you please; He is
Seeing of everything you do.
41. Those who reject
the Reminder when it has
come to them—it is an invincible Book.
42. Falsehood cannot approach it, from before
it or behind it. It is a revelation from One
Wise and Praiseworthy.
43. Nothing is said to you but was said to the
Messengers before you: your Lord is Posses-
sor of Forgiveness, and Possessor of Painful
Repayment.
44. Had We made it a Quran in a foreign lan-
guage, they would have said, “If only its
verses were made clear.” Non-Arabic and an
Arab? Say, “For those who believe, it is guid-
ance and healing. But as for those who do not
believe: there is heaviness in their ears, and it
is blindness for them. These are being called
from a distant place.”
45. We gave Moses the Book, but disputes
arose concerning it. Were it not for a prior
decree from your Lord, judgment would have
been pronounced between them. But they are
in perplexing doubt concerning it.
46. Whoever acts righteously does so for him-
self; and whoever works evil does so against
himself. Your Lord is not unjust to the serv-
ants.
47. To Him is referred the knowledge of the
Hour. No fruit emerges from its sheath, and
no female conceives or delivers, except with
His knowledge. And on the Day when He
calls out to them, “Where are My associates?”
They will say, “We admit to you, none of us
is a witness.”
48. What they used to pray to before will for-
sake them, and they will realize that they have
no escape.
49. The human being never tires of praying for
good things; but when adversity afflicts him,
he despairs and loses hope.
50. And when We let him taste a mercy from
Us, after the adversity that had afflicted him,
he will say, “This is mine, and I do not think
that the Hour is coming; and even if I am re-
turned to my Lord, I will have the very best
18342. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)
with Him.” We will inform those who disbe-
lieve of what they did, and We will make
them taste an awful punishment.
51. When We provide comfort for the human
being, he withdraws and distances himself;
but when adversity befalls him, he starts
lengthy prayers.
52. Say, “Have you considered? If it is from Al-
lah and you reject it—who is further astray
than he who is cutoff and alienated?”
53. We will show them Our proofs on the ho-
rizons, and in their very souls, until it be-
comes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it
not sufficient that your Lord is witness over
everything?
54. Surely they are in doubt about the encoun-
ter with their Lord. Surely He comprehends
everything.
42. CONSULTATION
(ash-Shura)

1. Ha,
Meem.
2. Ayn,
Seen, Qaf.
Thus He inspires you, and those before
you—Allah the Almighty, the Wise.
4. To him belongs everything in the heavens
and everything on earth. He is the Sublime,
the Magnificent.
5. The heavens above them almost burst apart,
while the angels glorify the praises of their
Lord, and ask forgiveness for those on earth.
Allah is indeed the Forgiver, the Merciful.
6. As for those who take masters other than
Him: Allah is in charge of them, and you are
not responsible for them.
7. Thus We inspired you with an Arabic
Quran, that you may warn the Central City
and whoever is around it, and to warn of the
Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt;
a group in the Garden, and a group in the
Furnace.
3.
8. Had Allah willed, He could have made them
one community, but He admits into His
mercy whomever He wills. As for the wrong-
doers, they will have no protector and no sav-
ior.
9. Or have they adopted protectors besides
him? But Allah is the Protector, and He gives
life to the dead, and He has power over all
things.
10. Whatever matter you differ about, its judg-
ment rests with Allah. “Such is Allah, my
Lord, in Whom I trust, and unto Him I re-
pent.”
11. Originator of the heavens and the earth. He
made for you mates from among yourselves,
and pairs of animals, by means of which He
multiplies you. There is nothing like Him. He
is the Hearing, the Seeing.
12. To Him belongs absolute control of the
heavens and the earth. He spreads the boun-
ties to whomever He wills, or reduces it. He
is aware of all things.
13. He prescribed for you the same religion He
enjoined upon Noah, and what We inspired
to you, and what We enjoined upon Abra-
ham, and Moses, and Jesus: “You shall up-
hold the religion, and be not divided therein.”
As for the idolaters, what you call them to is
outrageous to them. Allah chooses to Himself
whom He wills, and He guides to Himself
whoever repents.
14. They became divided only after knowledge
came to them, out of resentment among
themselves. Were it not for a predetermined
decision from your Lord, judgment would
have been pronounced between them. In-
deed, those who were made to inherit the
Book after them are in grave doubt about it.
15. To this go on inviting, and be upright as
you were commanded, and do not follow
their inclinations, and say, “I believe in what-
ever Book Allah has sent down, and I was
commanded to judge between you equitably.
Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our
deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be
no quarrel between us and you. Allah will
18442. CONSULTATION (ash-Shura)
bring us together, and to Him is the ultimate
return.”
16. As for those who dispute about Allah after
having answered His call, their argument is
invalid with their Lord; and upon them falls
wrath; and a grievous torment awaits them.
17. It is Allah who revealed the Book with the
truth, and the Balance. And what will make
you realize that perhaps the Hour is near?
18. Those who do not believe in it seek to has-
ten it; but those who believe are apprehensive
of it, and they know it to be the truth. Abso-
lutely, those who question the Hour are in
distant error.
19. Allah is kind towards His worshipers. He
provides for whomever He wills. He is the
Powerful, the Honorable.
20. Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereaf-
ter, We increase for him his harvest; and
whoever desires the harvest of this world, We
give him thereof, and he has no share of the
Hereafter.
21. Or is it that they have partners who litigate
for them religious laws never authorized by
Allah? Were it not for the conclusive deci-
sion, it would have been settled between
them. The wicked will have a painful punish-
ment.
22. You will see the unjust terrified of what
they have earned, and it will befall them. As
for those who believe and do good deeds,
they will be in the Meadows of the Gardens;
they will have whatever they please in the
presence of their Lord; that is the supreme
blessing.
23. That is the good news Allah gives to His
servants who believe and do good deeds. Say,
“I ask of you no wage for it, except affection
among the near of kin.” Whoever does a good
deed, We will increase its goodness for him.
Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative.
24. Or do they say, “He forged a lie about Al-
lah.” If Allah so willed, He could have sealed
your heart. But Allah obliterates the false, and
confirm the true by His Words. He knows
what is in the hearts.
25. It is He who accepts the repentance of His
worshipers, and remits the sins, and knows
what you do.
26. And He answers those who believe and do
good deeds, and He increases them of His
grace. But the disbelievers will suffer a terri-
ble punishment.
27. If Allah were to increase the provision to
His servants, they would transgress on earth;
but He sends down in precise measure what-
ever He wills. Surely, regarding His servants,
He is Expert and Observant.
28. It is He who brings down the rain after they
have despaired, and unfolds His mercy. He is
the Guardian, the Praised.
29. And of His signs are the creation of the
heavens and the earth, and the creatures He
has spread throughout them; and He is Able
to gather them at will.
30. Whatever misfortune befalls you, it is be-
cause of what your hands have earned; and
yet He pardons much.
31. You are not the ones to interfere on earth;
and besides Allah, you have no ally, and no
helper.
32. And of His signs are the ships sailing the
sea like flags.
33. If He willed, He could have stilled the
winds, leaving them motionless on its sur-
face. Surely in that are signs for every disci-
plined, grateful person.
34. Or He could wreck them, because of what
they have earned. And yet He pardons much.
35. Those who dispute Our signs know that
there is no asylum for them.
36. Whatever thing you are given is only the
provision of this life. But what Allah pos-
sesses is better and more lasting for those
who believe and rely on their Lord.
37. And those who avoid major sins and inde-
cencies; and if they become angry, they for-
give.
38. And those who respond to their Lord, and
pray regularly, and conduct their affairs by
18543. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
mutual consultation, and give of what We
have provided them.
39. And those who, when wronged, defend
themselves.
40. The repayment of a bad action is one
equivalent to it. But whoever pardons and
makes reconciliation, his reward lies with Al-
lah. He does not love the unjust.
41. As for those who retaliate after being
wronged, there is no blame on them.
42. Blame lies on those who wrong people, and
commit aggression in the land without right.
These will have a painful punishment.
43. But whoever endures patiently and for-
gives—that is a sign of real resolve.
44. Whoever Allah leaves astray has no protec-
tor apart from Him. And you will see the
transgressors, when they see the torment,
saying, “Is there a way of going back?”
45. And you will see them exposed to it, cow-
ering from disgrace, looking with concealed
eyes. Those who believed will say, “The losers
are those who lost themselves and their fam-
ilies on the Day of Resurrection.” Indeed, the
evildoers are in a lasting torment.
46. They will have no allies to support them
against Allah. Whomever Allah leaves astray
has no way out.
47. Respond to your Lord before there comes
from Allah a Day that cannot be turned back.
You will have no refuge on that Day, and no
possibility of denial.
48. But if they turn away—We did not send
you as a guardian over them. Your only duty
is communication. Whenever We let man
taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but
when misfortune befalls them, as a conse-
quence of what their hands have perpetrated,
man turns blasphemous.
49. To Allah belongs the dominion of the
heavens and the earth. He creates whatever
He wills. He grants daughters to whomever
He wills, and He grants sons to whomever He
wills.
50. Or He combines them together, males and
females; and He renders whomever He wills
sterile. He is Knowledgeable and Capable.
51. It is not for any human that Allah should
speak to him, except by inspiration, or from
behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to
reveal by His permission whatever He wills.
He is All-High, All-Wise.
52. We thus inspired you spiritually, by Our
command. You did not know what the Scrip-
ture is, nor what faith is, but We made it a
light, with which We guide whomever We
will of Our servants. You surely guide to a
straight path.
53. The path of Allah, to whom belongs every-
thing in the heavens and everything on earth.
Indeed, to Allah all matters revert.

the Book that makes things clear.
We made it an Arabic Quran, so that you
may understand.
4. And it is with Us, in the Source Book, sub-
lime and wise.
5. Shall We hold back the Reminder from you,
since you are a transgressing people?
6. How many a prophet did We send to the
ancients?
7. No messenger came to them, but they ridi-
culed him.
8. We destroyed people more powerful than
they, and so the example of the ancients has
passed away.
9. And if you asked them, “Who created the
heavens and the earth?” They would say,
“The Mighty, the Knower created them.”

18643. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
10. He who made the earth a habitat for you,
and traced pathways for you on it, that you
may be guided.
11. He who sends down water from the sky in
due proportion; and so We revive thereby a
dead land. Thus you will be brought out.
12. He Who created all the pairs; and provided
you with ships, and animals on which you
ride.
13. That you may mount their backs, and re-
member the favor of your Lord as you sit
firmly upon them, and say, “Glory be to Him
Who placed these at our service; surely we
could not have done it by ourselves.
14. And
surely, to our Lord we will return.”
15. Yet they turn one of His servants into a part
of Him. Man is clearly ungrateful.
Or has He chosen for Himself daughters
from what He creates, and favored you with
sons?
17. Yet when one of them is given news of what
he attributes to the Most Gracious, his face
darkens, and he suppresses grief.
18. “Someone brought up to be beautiful, and
unable to help in a fight?”
19. And they appoint the angels, who are serv-
ants to the Most Gracious, as females. Have
they witnessed their creation? Their claim
will be recorded, and they will be questioned.
20. And they say, “Had the Most Gracious
willed, we would not have worshiped them.”
But they have no knowledge of that; they are
merely guessing.
21. Or have We given them a book prior to this
one, to which they adhere?
22. But they say, “We found our parents on a
course, and we are guided in their footsteps.”
23. Likewise, We sent no warner before you to
any town, but the wealthy among them said,
“We found our parents on a course, and we
are following in their footsteps.”
24. He would say, “Even if I bring you better
guidance than what you found your parents

following?” They would say, “We reject what
you are sent with.”
25. So We wreaked vengeance upon them. Be-
hold, then, what was the fate of those who
deny.
26. When Abraham said to his father and his
people, “I am innocent of what you worship.
27. Except for He who created me, for He will
guide me.”
28. And he made it an enduring word in his
progeny, so that they may return.
29. I gave these and their forefathers some en-
joyment, until the truth and a manifest mes-
senger came to them.
30. But when the truth came to them, they
said, “This is sorcery, and we refuse to believe
in it.”
31. They also said, “If only this Quran was sent
down to a man of importance from the two
cities.”
32. Is it they who allocate the mercy of your
Lord? It is We who have allocated their live-
lihood in this life, and We elevated some of
them in rank above others, that some of them
would take others in service. But your Lord’s
mercy is better than what they amass.
33. Were it not that humanity would become a
single community, We would have provided
those who disbelieve in the Most Gracious
with roofs of silver to their houses, and stair-
ways by which they ascend.
34. And doors to their houses, and furnishings
on which they recline.
35. And decorations. Yet all that is nothing but
the stuff of this life. Yet the Hereafter, with
your Lord, is for the righteous.
36. Whoever shuns the remembrance of the
Most Gracious, We assign for him a devil, to
be his companion.
37. They hinder them from the path, though
they think they are guided.

43. DECORATIONS (az-Zukhruf)
38. Until, when He comes to Us, he will say, “If
only there were between me and you the dis-
tance of the two Easts.” What an evil com-
panion!
39. It will not benefit you on that Day, since
you did wrong. You are partners in the suf-
fering.
40. Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the
blind, and him who is in evident error?
41. Even if We take you away, We will wreak
vengeance upon them.
42. Or show you what We have promised
them; for We have absolute power over them.
43. So adhere to what is revealed to you. You
are upon a straight path.
44. It is a message for you, and for your people;
and you will be questioned.
45. Ask those of Our messengers We sent be-
fore you: “Did We appoint gods besides the
Most Gracious to be worshiped?”
46. We sent Moses with Our revelations to
Pharaoh and his dignitaries. He said, “I am
the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.”
47. But when he showed them Our signs, they
started laughing at them.
48. Each sign We showed them was more mar-
velous than its counterpart. And We afflicted
them with the plagues, so that they may re-
pent.
49. They said, “O sorcerer, pray to your Lord
for us, according to His pledge to you, and
then we will be guided.”
50. But when We lifted the torment from
them, they immediately broke their promise.
51. Pharaoh proclaimed among his people,
saying, “O my people, do I not own the King-
dom of Egypt, and these rivers flow beneath
me? Do you not see?
52. Am I not better than this miserable wretch,
who can barely express himself?
53. Why are bracelets of gold not dropped on
him, or they angels came with him in proces-
sion?”
54. Thus
he fooled his people, and they obeyed
him. They were wicked people.
55. And when they provoked Our wrath, We
took retribution from them, and We
drowned them all.
56. Thus We made them a precedent and an
example for the others.
57. And when the son of Mary was cited as an
example, your people opposed.
58. They said, “Are our gods better, or he?”
They cited him only for argument. In fact,
they are a quarrelsome people.
59. He was just a servant whom We blessed,
and We made him an example for the Chil-
dren of Israel.
60. Had We willed, We would have made of
you angels to be successors on earth.
61. He is a portent of the Hour, so have no
doubt about it, and follow Me. This is a
straight way.
62. And let not Satan divert you. He is an open
enemy to you.
63. When Jesus came with the clarifications, he
said, “I have come to you with wisdom, and
to clarify for you some of what you differ
about. So fear Allah, and obey me.
64. Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-
ship Him—this is a straight path.”
65. But the factions differed among them-
selves. So woe to the wrongdoers from the
suffering of a painful Day.
66. Are they only waiting for the Hour to come
upon them suddenly, while they are una-
ware?
67. On that Day, friends will be enemies of one
another, except for the righteous.
68. O My servants, you have nothing to fear on
that Day, nor will you grieve.
69. Those who believed in Our revelations,
and were submissive.
70. Enter the Garden, you and your spouses,
Joyfully.

71. They will be served around with trays of
gold, and cups. Therein is whatever the souls
desire and delights the eyes. Therein you will
stay forever.
72. Such is the Garden you are made to inherit,
because of what you used to do.
73. Therein you will have abundant fruit, from
which you eat.
74. As for the sinners, they will be in the tor-
ment of Hell forever.
75. It will never be eased for them. In it, they
will be devastated.
76. We did them no injustice, but it was they
who were the unjust.
77. And they will cry, “O Malek, let your Lord
finish us off.” He will say, “You are staying.”
78. We have given you the truth, but most of
you hate the truth.
79. Have they contrived some scheme? We too
are contriving.
80. Or do they think that We cannot hear their
secrets and their conspiracies? Yes indeed,
Our messengers are by them, writing down.
81. Say, “If the Most Gracious had a son, I
would be the first to worship.”
82. Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and
the earth, the Lord of the Throne, beyond
what they describe.
83. So leave them to blunder and play, until
they encounter their Day which they are
promised.
84. It is He who is Allah in heaven, and Allah
on earth. He is the Wise, the Knower.
85. And blessed is He Who has sovereignty
over the heavens and the earth and what is
between them. He alone has knowledge of the
Hour, and to Him you will be returned.
86. Those they invoke besides Him are incapa-
ble of intercession; only those who testify to
the truth and have knowledge.
87. And if you asked them, “Who created
them?”, they would say, “Allah.” Why then
do they deviate?
88. As
for his statement: “My Lord, these are a
people who do not believe.”
89. Pardon them, and say, “Peace.” They will
come to know.

13. But how can they be reminded? An enlight-

14. But they turned away from him, and said,
“Educated, but crazy!”
15. We will ease the punishment a little, but
you will revert.

22. He appealed to his Lord: “These are a sinful

23. “Set out with My servants by night—you

24. And cross the sea quickly; they are an army

25. How many gardens and fountains did they
leave behind?
26. And
plantations, and splendid buildings.
27. And
comforts they used to enjoy.
28. So it was; and We passed it on to another
people.
29. Neither heaven nor earth wept over them,
nor were they reprieved.
30. And We delivered the Children of Israel
from the humiliating persecution.
31. From Pharaoh. He was a transgressing ty-
rant.
32. And We chose them knowingly over all
other people.
33. And We gave them many signs, in which

“There is nothing but our first death, and
we will not be resurrected.
36. Bring back our ancestors, if you are truth-

They were evildoers.
38. We did not create the heavens and the
earth and what is between them to play.

We created them only for a specific pur-
