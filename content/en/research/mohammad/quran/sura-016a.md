{{< s v="1" >}}  The command of Allah has come, so do not rush it. Glory be to Him; exalted above what they associate.

{{< s v="2" >}}  He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command, upon whom He wills of His servants: “Give warning that there is no god but Me, and fear Me.”

{{< s v="3" >}}  He created the heavens and the earth with justice. He is exalted above the associations
they attribute.{{< s v="4" >}}  He created the human being from a drop of
fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.{{< s v="5" >}}  And the livestock—He created them for
you. In them are warmth and benefits for
you, and of them you eat.

6. And there is beauty in them for you, when you bring them home, and when you drive them to pasture.

7. And they carry your loads to territory you could not have reached without great hardship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.
8. And the horses, and the mules, and the donkeys—for you to ride, and for luxury. And He creates what you do not know.{{< s v="9" >}}  It is for Allah to point out the paths, but some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He
could have guided you all.

{{< s v="10" >}}  It is He Who sends down for you from the sky water. From it is drink, and with it grows
vegetation for grazing.

{{< s v="11" >}} He produces for you grains with it, and olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for
people who think.
12. And He regulated for you the night and the
day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars
are disposed by His command. Surely in that
are signs for people who ponder.
13. And whatsoever He created for you on
earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a
sign for people who are mindful.
14. And it is He who made the sea to serve you,
that you may eat from it tender meat, and ex-
tract from it ornaments that you wear. And
you see the ships plowing through it, as you
seek His bounties, so that you may give
thanks.
15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it
shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that
you may be guided.
{{< s v="16" >}}And landmarks. And by the stars they
guide themselves.
17. Is He who creates like him who does not
create? Will you not take a lesson?
18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of
Allah, you will not be able to count them. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19. And Allah knows what you hide and what
you disclose.
20. Those they invoke besides Allah create
nothing, but are themselves created.
21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not
know when they will be resurrected.
22. Your God is one God. As for those who do
not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are
in denial, and they are arrogant.
23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they
conceal and what they reveal. He does not
like the arrogant.
And when it is said to them, “What has
your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of
the ancients.”
25. So let them carry their loads complete on
the Day of Resurrection, and some of the
loads of those they misguided without
knowledge. Evil is what they carry.
26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah
took their structures from the foundations,
and the roof caved in on them. The punish-
ment came at them from where they did not
perceive.
27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will
disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso-
ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?”
Those who were given knowledge will say,
“Today shame and misery are upon the dis-
believers.”
28. Those wronging their souls while the an-
gels are taking them away—they will propose
peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah
is aware of what you used to do.”
29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for-
ever. Miserable is the residence of the arro-
gant.
30. And it will be said to those who maintained
piety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They
will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good
in this world is goodness, and the Home of
the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful
is the residence of the pious.
31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will
enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they
will have whatever they desire. Thus Allah re-
wards the pious.
32. Those who are in a wholesome state when
the angels take them—will say, “Peace be
upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used
to do.”
33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come
to them, or for the command of your Lord to
arrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah
did not wrong them, but they used to wrong
their own souls.
24.

So the evils of their deeds assailed them,
and what they used to ridicule engulfed them.
35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we
would not have worshiped anything besides
Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor
would we have prohibited anything besides
His prohibitions.” Those before them did
likewise. Are the messengers responsible for
anything but clear communication?
36. To every community We sent a messenger:
“Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of
them Allah guided, while others deserved
misguidance. So travel through the earth, and
see what the fate of the deniers was.
37. Even though you may be concerned about
their guidance, Allah does not guide those
who misguide. And they will have no saviors.
38. And they swear by Allah with their most
solemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any-
one who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise
binding on Him, but most people do not
know.
39. To clarify for them what they differed
about, and for the faithless to know that they
were liars.
40. When We intend for something to happen,
We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.
41. Those who emigrate for Allah’s sake after
being persecuted, We will settle them in a
good place in this world; but the reward of
the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.
42. Those who endure patiently, and in their
Lord they put their trust.
43. We did not send before you except men
whom We inspired. So ask the people of
knowledge, if you do not know.
44. With the clarifications and the scriptures.
And We revealed to you the Reminder, that
you may clarify to the people what was re-
vealed to them, and that they may reflect.
45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that
Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with
them, or that the punishment will not come
upon them from where they do not perceive?
46. Or that He will not seize them during their
activities? And they will not be able to pre-
vent it.
47. Or that He will not seize them while in
dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.
48. Have they not observed what Allah has cre-
ated? Their shadows revolve from the right
and the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink
away.
49. To Allah bows down everything in the
heavens and everything on earth—every liv-
ing creature, and the angels, and without be-
ing proud.
50. They fear their Lord above them, and they
do what they are commanded.
51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He
is only One God; so fear only Me.”
52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth; and to Him obedience is due
always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than
Allah?
53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah.
And when harm touches you, it is to Him that
you groan.
54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some
of you associate others with their Lord.
55. To show ingratitude for what We have
given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon
know.
56. And they allocate, to something they do
not know, a share of what We have provided
for them. By Allah, you will be questioned
about what you have been inventing.
57. And they attribute to Allah daughters—ex-
alted is He—and for themselves what they de-
sire.
58. And when one of them is given news of a
female infant, his face darkens, and he chokes
with grief.
59. He hides from the people because of the
bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in hu-
miliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the
decision they make.

34.
after having acquired knowledge. Allah is
Omniscient and Omnipotent.
71. Allah has favored some of you over others
in livelihood. Those who are favored would
not give their properties to their servants, to
the extent of making them partners in it. Will
they then renounce Allah’s blessings?
72. Allah has given you mates from among
yourselves; and has produced for you, from
your mates, children and grandchildren; and
has provided you with good things. Will they
then believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah’s
favors?
73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos-
sesses no provisions for them in the heavens,
nor on earth, nor are they capable.
74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah
knows, and you do not know.
75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave,
who has no power over anything; and some-
one to whom We have given plentiful provi-
sion, from which he gives secretly and
openly. Are they equal in comparison? All
praise belongs to Allah, but most of them do
not know.
76. And Allah cites the example of two men:
one of them dumb, unable to do anything,
and is a burden on his master; whichever way
he directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is
he equal to him who commands justice, and
is on a straight path?
77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens
and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only
as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al-
lah has power over everything.
78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’
wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave
you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the
brains; that you may give thanks.
79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the
midst of the sky? None sustains them except
Allah. In this are signs for people who believe.
80. And Allah has given you in your homes
habitats for you, and has provided for you out
of the hides of livestock portable homes for
60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
set a bad example, while Allah sets the High-
est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in-
justices, He would not leave upon it a single
creature, but He postpones them until an ap-
pointed time. Then, when their time arrives,
they will not delay it by one hour, nor will
they advance it.
62. And they attribute to Allah what they
themselves dislike, while their tongues utter
the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a
doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be
neglected.
63. By Allah, We sent messengers to commu-
nities before you, but Satan made their deeds
appear alluring to them. He is their master
today, and they will have a painful punish-
ment.
64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to
clarify for them what they differ about, and
guidance and mercy for people who believe.
65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with
which He revives the earth after its death. In
this is a sign for people who listen.
66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We
give you a drink from their bellies, from be-
tween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing
to the drinkers.
67. And from the fruits of date-palms and
grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome
food. In this is a sign for people who under-
stand.
68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up
hives in the mountains, and in the trees, and
in what they construct.”
69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the
pathways of your Lord, with precision. From
their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors,
containing healing for the people. Surely in
this is a sign for people who reflect.
70. Allah created you; then He takes you away.
Some of you will be brought back to the worst
age, so that he will no longer know anything,
99{{< s v="16" >}}THE BEE (an-Nahl)
you, so you can use them when you travel,
and when you camp; and from their wool,
and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort
for a while.
81. And Allah has made for you shade out of
what He has created, and has given you re-
sorts in the mountains, and has given you
garments to protect you from the heat, and
garments to protect you from your violence.
Thus He completes His blessings upon you,
so that you may submit.
82. But if they turn away, your only duty is
clear communication.
83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then
deny it, as most of them are ungrateful.
84. On the Day when We raise up a witness
from every community—those who disbe-
lieved will not be permitted, nor will they be
excused.
85. When those who did wrong see the pun-
ishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor
will they be reprieved.
86. And when the idolaters see their associates,
they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ-
ates whom we used to invoke besides You.”
They will strike back at them with the saying,
“Surely you are liars.”
87. On that Day they will offer their submis-
sion to Allah, and what they had invented will
abandon them.
88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from
Allah’s path—We will add punishment to
their punishment, on account of the mischief
they used to make.
89. On the Day when We raise in every com-
munity a witness against them, from among
them, and bring you as a witness against
these. We have revealed to you the Book, as
an explanation of all things, and guidance,
and mercy and good news for those who sub-
mit.
90. Allah commands justice, and goodness,
and generosity towards relatives. And He for-
bids immorality, and injustice, and oppres-
sion. He advises you, so that you may take
heed.
91. Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you make a
covenant, and do not break your oaths after
ratifying them. You have made Allah your
guarantor, and Allah knows what you do.
92. And do not be like her who unravels her
yarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has
spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means
of deception among you, because one com-
munity is more prosperous than another. Al-
lah is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res-
urrection, He will make clear to you every-
thing you had disputed about.
93. Had Allah willed, He would have made you
one congregation, but He leaves astray whom
He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And
you will surely be questioned about what you
used to do.
94. And do not use your oaths to deceive one
another, so that a foot may not slip after being
firm, and you taste misery because you hin-
dered from Allah’s path, and incur a terrible
torment.
95. And do not exchange Allah’s covenant for
a small price. What is with Allah is better for
you, if you only knew.
96. What you have runs out, but what is with
Allah remains. We will reward those who are
patient according to the best of their deeds.
97. Whoever works righteousness, whether
male or female, while being a believer, We
will grant him a good life—and We will re-
ward them according to the best of what they
used to do.
98. When you read the Quran, seek refuge
with Allah from Satan the outcast.
99. He has no authority over those who believe
and trust in their Lord.
100. His authority is only over those who fol-
low him, and those who associate others with
Him.

101. When We substitute a verse in place of another verse—and Allah knows best what He reveals—they say, “You are an impostor.” But
most of them do not know.
102. Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought it down
from your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabi-
lize those who believe, and as guidance and
good news for those who submit.”
103. We are well aware that they say, “It is a hu-
man being who is teaching him.” But the
tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while
this is a clear Arabic tongue.
104. Those who do not believe in Allah’s reve-
lations—Allah will not guide them, and for
them is a painful punishment.
105. It is those who do not believe in Allah’s
revelations who fabricate falsehood. These
are the liars.
106. Whoever renounces faith in Allah after
having believed—except for someone who is
compelled, while his heart rests securely in
faith—but whoever willingly opens up his
heart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath
from Allah, and for them is a tremendous
torment.
107. That is because they have preferred the
worldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al-
lah does not guide the people who refuse.
108. It is they whom Allah has sealed their
hearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is
they who are the heedless.
109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter
they will be the losers.
110. But then your Lord—for those who emi-
grated after being persecuted, then struggled
and persevered—your Lord thereafter is For-
giving and Merciful.
111. On the Day when every soul will come
pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid
in full for what it has done, and they will not
be wronged.
112. And Allah cites the example of a town that
was secure and peaceful, with its livelihood
coming to it abundantly from every direc-
tion. But then it turned unappreciative of Al-
lah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the robe
of hunger and fear, because of what they used
to craft.

113. A messenger from among them had come to them, but they denounced him, so the
punishment seized them in the midst of their wrongdoing.

114. Eat of the lawful and good things Allah has provided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s
blessings, if it is Him that you serve.

115. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and anything conse-
crated to other than Allah. 

But if anyone is compelled by necessity, without being delib-
erate or malicious, then Allah is Merciful.


1{{< s v="16" >}}And do not say of falsehood asserted by
your tongues, “This is lawful, and this is un-
lawful,” in order to invent lies and attribute
them to Allah. Those who invent lies and at-
tribute them to Allah will not succeed.
117. A brief enjoyment—then they will have a
painful punishment.
118. For those who are Jews, We have prohib-
ited what We related to you before. We did
not wrong them, but they used to wrong their
own selves.
119. But towards those who do wrongs in igno-
rance, and then repent afterwards and re-
form, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and
Merciful.
120. Abraham was an exemplary leader, de-
voted to Allah, a monotheist, and was not of
the polytheists.
121. Thankful for His blessings. He chose him,
and guided him to a straight path.
122. And We gave him goodness in this world,
and in the Hereafter he will be among the
righteous.
123. Then We inspired you: “Follow the reli-
gion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was
not an idol-worshiper.”
124. The Sabbath was decreed only for those
who differed about it. Your Lord will judge
between them on the Day of Resurrection re-
garding their differences.
125. Invite to the way of your Lord with wis-
dom and good advice, and debate with them
in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is
aware of those who stray from His path, and
He is aware of those who are guided.
126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the
same degree as the injury done to you. But if
you resort to patience—it is better for the pa-
tient.
127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from
Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do
not be stressed by their schemes.
128. Allah is with those who are righteous and
those who are virtuous.
