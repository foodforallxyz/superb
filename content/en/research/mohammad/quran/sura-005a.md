O you who believe! Fulfill your commitments. 

Livestock animals are allowedm except those specified. Wild game is not allowed  while you are in pilgrim sanctity.


2. Do not violate:
- Allah’s sacraments
- the Sacred Month
- the offerings
- the garlanded
- those heading for the Sacred House seeking blessings from their Lord and approval. 

When you have left the pilgrim sanctity, you may hunt.

And let not the hatred of people who barred you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to aggression. And cooperate with one another in virtuous conduct and conscience, and do not cooperate with one another in sin and hostility. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punishment.

3. Prohibited for you are carrion, blood, the flesh of swine, and animals dedicated to other
than Allah; also the flesh of animals strangled, killed violently, killed by a fall, gored to
death, mangled by wild animals—except what you rescue, and animals sacrificed on
altars; and the practice of drawing lots. 

For it is immoral. Today, those who disbelieve have despaired of your religion, so do not fear
them, but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, and have completed
My favor upon you, and have approved Islam as a religion for you. But whoever is compelled by hunger, with no intent of wrongdoing—Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

4. They ask you what is permitted for them. Say, “Permitted for you are all good things,
including what trained dogs and falcons catch for you.” You train them according to
what Allah has taught you. So eat from what they catch for you, and pronounce Allah’s
name over it. <!-- And fear Allah. Allah is Swift in reckoning. -->

5. Today all good things are made lawful for you. And the food of those given the Scrip-
ture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. So are chaste believing women, and
chaste women from the people who were given the Scripture before you, provided you
give them their dowries, and take them in marriage, not in adultery, nor as mistresses.
But whoever rejects faith, his work will be in vain, and in the Hereafter he will be among
the losers.

6. When you rise to pray, wash your faces and your hands and arms to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet to the ankles. If you had intercourse, then
purify yourselves. 

If you are ill, or travelling, or one of you returns from the toilet, or you
had contact with women, and could not find
water, then use some clean sand and wipe
your faces and hands with it. 

Allah intends:
- to purify you, not to burden you
- to complete His blessing upon you, that you may be thankful.

7. Remember Allah’s blessings upon you, and His covenant which He covenanted with
you; when you said, “We hear and we obey.”

Remain conscious of Allah, for Allah knows what the hearts contain.

8. Be upright to Allah, witnessing with justice; and let not the hatred of
a certain people prevent you from acting justly. Adhere to justice, for that is nearer to
piety; and fear Allah. Allah is informed of what you do.

9. Allah has promised those who believe and work righteousness: they will have for-
giveness and a great reward.

10. As for those who disbelieve and reject Our
revelations—these are the inmates of Hell.

11. O you who believe! Remember Allah's
blessings upon you; when certain people in-
tended to extend their hands against you, and
He restrained their hands from you. So rev-
erence Allah, and in Allah let the believers
put their trust.

12. Allah received a pledge from the Children
of Israel, and We raised among them twelve
chiefs. Allah said, “I am with you; if you per-
form the prayer, and pay the alms, and be-
lieve in My messengers and support them,
and lend Allah a loan of righteousness; I will
remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens
beneath which rivers flow. But whoever
among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed
from the right way.”

13. Because of their breaking their pledge, We
cursed them, and made their hearts hard.
They twist the words out of their context, and
they disregarded some of what they were re-
minded of. You will always witness deceit
from them, except for a few of them. But par-
don them, and overlook. Allah loves the do-
ers of good.

14. And from those who say, “We are Chris-
tians,” We received their pledge, but they ne-
glected some of what they were reminded of.
So We provoked enmity and hatred among
them until the Day of Resurrection; Allah will
then inform them of what they used to craft.

15. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has
come to you, clarifying for you much of what
you kept hidden of the Book, and overlook-
ing much. A light from Allah has come to
you, and a clear Book.

16. Allah guides with it whoever follows His
approval to the ways of peace, and He brings
them out of darkness into light, by His per-
mission, and He guides them in a straight
path.

17. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the
Christ, the son of Mary.” Say, “Who can pre-
vent Allah, if He willed, from annihilating the
Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and eve-
ryone on earth?” To Allah belongs the sover-
eignty of the heavens and the earth and what
is between them. He creates whatever He
wills, and Allah has power over everything.

18. The Jews and the Christians say, “We are
the children of Allah, and His beloved.” Say,
“Why then does He punish you for your
sins?” In fact, you are humans from among
those He created. He forgives whom He wills,
and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah
belongs the dominion of the heavens and the
earth and what lies between them, and to
Him is the return.

19. O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you—after a cessation of messengers—so that you
cannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and no warner.” In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner; and Allah is Capable of
everything.

20. When Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember Allah’s blessings upon
you, when He placed prophets among you, and made you kings, and gave you what He never gave any other people.”

21. “O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned for you, and do not turn
back, lest you return as losers.”

22. They said, “O Moses, there are tyrannical people in it; we will not enter it until they
leave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.”

23. Two men of those who feared, but whom Allah had blessed, said, “Go at them by the
gate; and when you have entered it, you will prevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are
believers.”

24. They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you
and your Lord, and fight. We are staying right here.”

25. He said, “My Lord! I have control only over
myself and my brother, so separate between
us and between the wicked people.”
26. He said, “It is forbidden for them for forty
years. They will wander aimlessly in the land.
So do not grieve over the defiant people.”
27. And relate to them the true story of Adam's
two sons: when they offered an offering, and
it was accepted from one of them, but it was
not accepted from the other. He Said, “I will
kill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts only from
the righteous.”
28. “If you extend your hand to kill me, I will
not extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Al-
lah, Lord of the Worlds.”
29. “I would rather you bear my sin and your
sin, and you become among the inmates of
the Fire. Such is the reward for the evildoers.”
30. Then His soul prompted him to kill his
brother, so he killed him, and became one of
the losers.
Then Allah sent a raven digging the
ground, to show him how to cover his broth-
er's corpse. He said, “Woe to me! I was unable
to be like this raven, and bury my brother's
corpse.” So he became full of regrets.
32. Because of that We ordained for the Chil-
dren of Israel: that whoever kills a person—
unless it is for murder or corruption on
earth—it is as if he killed the whole of man-
kind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved
the whole of mankind. Our messengers came
to them with clarifications, but even after
that, many of them continue to commit ex-
cesses in the land.
33. The punishment for those who fight Allah
and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they be killed, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on
opposite sides, or be banished from the land.
That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the
Hereafter they will have a terrible punishment.

34. Except for those who repent before you apprehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.

35. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah, and seek the means of approach to Him, and
strive in His cause, so that you may succeed.

36. As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it
with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resur-
rection, it will not be accepted from them.

For them is a painful punishment.

37. They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a lasting punishment.

38. As for the thief, whether male or female, cut their hands as a penalty for what they
have reaped—a deterrent from Allah. 

39. But whoever repents after his crime, and reforms, Allah will accept his repentance. 

40. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He


guidance and light, and confirming the Torah that preceded him, and guidance and
counsel for the righteous.

47. So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what Allah revealed in it. Those who
do not rule according to what Allah revealedare the sinners.

48. We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded
it, and superseding it. So judge between them
according to what Allah revealed, and do not
follow their desires if they differ from the
truth that has come to you. For each of you
We have assigned a law and a method. Had
Allah willed, He could have made you a single
nation, but He tests you through what He has
given you. So compete in righteousness. To
Allah is your return, all of you; then He will
inform you of what you had disputed.
49. And judge between them according to
what Allah revealed, and do not follow their
desires. And beware of them, lest they lure
you away from some of what Allah has re-
vealed to you. But if they turn away, know
that Allah intends to strike them with some
of their sins. In fact, a great many people are
corrupt.
50. Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that
they desire? Who is better than Allah in judg-
ment for people who are certain?
51. O you who believe! Do not take the Jews
and the Christians as allies; some of them are
allies of one another. Whoever of you allies
himself with them is one of them. Allah does
not guide the wrongdoing people.
52. You will see those in whose hearts is sick-
ness racing towards them. They say, “We fear
the wheel of fate may turn against us.” But
perhaps Allah will bring about victory, or
some event of His making; thereupon they
will regret what they concealed within themselves.

53. Those who believe will say, “Are these the
ones who swore by Allah with their strongest
oaths that they are with you?” Their works
have failed, so they became losers. 

punishes whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Capable of everything.

41. O Messenger! Do not let those who are
quick to disbelief grieve you—from among
those who say with their mouths, “We be-
lieve,” but their hearts do not believe; and
from among the Jews—listeners to lies, lis-
teners to other people who did not come to
you. They distort words from their places,
and they say, “If you are given this, accept it;
but if you are not given it, beware.” Whom-
ever Allah has willed to divert, you have
nothing for him from Allah. Those are they
whose hearts Allah does not intend to purify.
For them is disgrace in this world, and for
them is a great punishment in the Hereafter.
42. Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit
earnings. If they come to you, judge between
them, or turn away from them. If you turn
away from them, they will not harm you in
the least. But if you judge, judge between
them equitably. Allah loves the equitable.
43. But why do they come to you for judgment,
when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s
Law? Yet they turn away after that. These are
not believers.

44. We have revealed the Torah, wherein is
guidance and light. The submissive prophets
ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rab-
bis and the scholars, as they were required to
protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it.
So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do
not sell My revelations for a cheap price.
Those who do not rule according to what Al-
lah revealed are the unbelievers.

45. And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life,
an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for
an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal
wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it
in charity, it will serve as atonement for him.
Those who do not rule according to what Al-
lah revealed are the evildoers.

46. In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of
Mary, fulfilling the Torah that preceded him;
and We gave him the Gospel, wherein is

O you who believe! Whoever of you goesback on his religion—Allah will bring a peo-
ple whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with the disbelievers. 

They strive in the way of Allah, and do not fear the blame of the critic. That is the
grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever He wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.
55. Your allies are Allah, and His Messenger, and those who believe—those who pray reg-
ularly, and give charity, and bow down. 

56. Whoever allies himself with Allah, and His Messenger, and those who believe—surely
the Party of Allah is the victorious.

57. O you who believe! Do not befriend those who take your religion in mockery and as a
sport, be they from among those who were given the Scripture before you, or the disbelievers. And obey Allah, if you are believers.

58. When you call to the prayer, they take it as a joke and a trifle. That is because they are people who do not reason.
59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah, and
in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed previously; and most of you are sinners?”

60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that for retribution from Allah? He whom Allah
has cursed, and with whom He became angry; and He turned some of them into apes,
and swine, and idol worshipers. 

These are in a worse position, and further away from the right way.”

61. When they come to you, they say, “We believe,” though they have entered with disbelief, and they have departed with it. But Allah is well aware of what they hide.

62. You see many of them competing with one another in sin and hostility, and their con-
suming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.
63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not prevent them from speaking sinfully and from
consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what they have been doing.
The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” 

It is their hands that are tied, and they are cursed
for what they say. In fact, His hands are out-
stretched; He gives as He wills. Certainly,
what was revealed to your from your Lord
will increase many of them in defiance and
blasphemy. And We placed between them
enmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec-
tion. Whenever they kindle the fire of war,
Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to
spread corruption on earth. Allah does not
love the corrupters.
65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed
and been righteous, We would have remitted
their sins, and admitted them into the Gar-
dens of Bliss.
66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gos-
pel, and what was revealed to them from their
Lord, they would have consumed amply from
above them, and from beneath their feet.
Among them is a moderate community, but
evil is what many of them are doing.

67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to you from your Lord. But if you do not, then
you would not have delivered His message. 

And Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the
Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord.” But what is revealed to you from
your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for
the disbelieving people.

69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians—whoever be-
lieves in Allah and the Last Day, and does what is right—they have nothing to fear, nor
shall they grieve.

70. We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers.
Whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire, some of them
they accused of lying, and others they put to death.

71. They assumed there would be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Al-
lah redeemed them, but then again many of them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is Seeing of what they do.

72. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary.” But the Messiah
himself said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever as-
sociates others with Allah, Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire.
The wrongdoers have no saviors.”

73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the third of three.” But there is no deity except
the One God. If they do not refrain from what
they say, a painful torment will befall those
among them who disbelieve.
74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His
forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes-
senger, before whom other Messengers had
passed away, and his mother was a woman of
truth. They both used to eat food. Note how
We make clear the revelations to them; then
note how deluded they are.
76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what
has no power to harm or benefit you?” But
Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.
77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not ex-
aggerate in your religion beyond the truth;
and do not follow the opinions of people who
went astray before, and misled many, and
themselves strayed off the balanced way.”
78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from
among the Children of Israel by the tongue of
David and Jesus son of Mary. That is because
they rebelled and used to transgress.
79. They used not to prevent one another from
the wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what
they used to do.
80. You will see many of them befriending
those who disbelieve. Terrible is what their
souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah
fell upon them, and in the torment they will
remain.

Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him,
they would not have befriended them. But many of them are immoral.

82. You will find that the people most hostile towards the believers are the Jews and the
polytheists. And you will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those
who say, “We are Christians.” That is because among them are priests and monks, and they
are not arrogant.

83. And when they hear what was revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing
with tears, as they recognize the truth in it.

They say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so count us among the witnesses.”
84. “And why should we not believe in Allah, and in the truth that has come to us, and hope
that our Lord will include us among the righteous people?”

85. Allah will reward them for what they say—Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where
they will stay forever. Such is the reward of the righteous.
86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.
87. O you who believe! Do not prohibit the good things Allah has permitted for you, and
do not commit aggression. Allah does not love the aggressors.
88. And eat of the lawful and good things Allah
has provided for you; and be conscious of Al-
lah, in whom you are believers.

89. Allah does not hold you accountable for your unintended oaths, but He holds you ac-
countable for your binding oaths. The atonement for it is by feeding ten needy people
from the average of what you feed your families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a
slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days. That is the atonement for
breaking your oaths when you have sworn
them. So keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes
clear His Revelations to you, that you may be
grateful.

90. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are abominations of
Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.

91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gam-
bling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you
not desist?

92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and be cautious. If you turn away—know that the
duty of Our Messenger is clear communication.
93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds
will not be blamed for what they may have
eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and
do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith,
then remain righteous and charitable. Allah
loves the charitable.
94. O you who believe! Allah will test you with
something of the game your hands and spears
obtain, that Allah may know who fears Him
at heart. Whoever commits aggression after
that will have a painful punishment.
95. O you who believe! do not kill game while
you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you
kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a
domestic animal comparable to what he
killed, as determined by two honest persons
among you—an offering delivered to the
Kaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the
needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he
may taste the consequences of his conduct.
Allah forgives what is past. But whoever re-
peats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is
Almighty, Avenger.
96. Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and
its food—as sustenance for you and for trav-
elers. But forbidden for you is the game of
land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And
fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.
97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred
House, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sa-
cred Month, and the offerings, and the gar-
landed. That you may know that Allah knows
everything in the heavens and the earth, and
that Allah is Cognizant of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution,
and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al-
lah knows what you reveal and what you con-
ceal.
100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal,
even though the abundance of the bad may
impress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you
who possess intelligence, that you may suc-
ceed.”
101. O you who believe! Do not ask about
things that would trouble you if disclosed to
you. But if you were to ask about them while
the Quran is being revealed, they will become
obvious to you. Allah forgives that. Allah is
Forgiving and Clement.
102. A people before you asked about them, but
then came to reject them.
103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of
Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but
those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al-
lah—most of them do not understand.
104. And when it is said to them, “Come to
what Allah has revealed, and to the Messen-
ger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we
found our forefathers upon.” Even if their
forefathers knew nothing, and were not
guided?
105. O you who believe! You are responsible
for your own souls. He who has strayed can-
not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is
you return, all of you, and He will inform you
of what you used to do.
106. O you who believe! When death ap-
proaches one of you, let two reliable persons
from among you act as witnesses to the mak-
ing of a bequest, or two persons from another
people if you are travelling in the land and the
event of death approaches you. Engage them
after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them
swear by Allah: “We will not sell our testi-
mony for any price, even if he was a near rel-
ative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testi-
mony, for then we would be sinners.”
107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of
perjury: let two others take their place, two

of us, and a sign from You; and provide for
us; You are the Best of providers.”
115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But
whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I
will punish him with a punishment the like of
which I never punish any other being.”
116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary,
did you say to the people, `Take me and my
mother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will
say, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say
what I have no right to. Had I said it, You
would have known it. You know what is in
my soul, and I do not know what is in your
soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.
117. I only told them what You commanded
me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord
and your Lord. And I was a witness over them
while I was among them; but when You took
me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over
them—You are Witness over everything.
118. If You punish them, they are Your serv-
ants; but if You forgive them, You are the
Mighty and Wise.”
119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the
truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.”
They will have Gardens beneath which rivers
flow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah
is pleased with them, and they are pleased
with Him. That is the great attainment.
120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the
heavens and the earth and what lies in them,
and He has power over everything.
from among those responsible for the claim,
and have them swear by Allah, “Our testi-
mony is more truthful than their testimony,
and we will not be biased, for then we would
be wrongdoers.”
108. That makes it more likely that they will
give true testimony, fearing that their oaths
might be contradicted by subsequent oaths.
So fear Allah, and listen. Allah does not guide
the disobedient people.
109. On the Day when Allah will gather the
messengers, then say, “What response were
you given?” They will say, “We have no
knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of
the unseen.”
110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary,
recall My favor upon you and upon your
mother, how I supported you with the Holy
Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib,
and in maturity. How I taught you the Scrip-
ture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos-
pel. And recall that you molded from clay the
shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you
breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My
leave. And you healed the blind and the lep-
rous, by My leave; and you revived the dead,
by My leave. And recall that I restrained the
Children of Israel from you when you
brought them the clear miracles. But those
who disbelieved among them said, `This is
nothing but obvious sorcery.'“
“And when I inspired the disciples: `Be-
lieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said,
`We have believed, so bear witness that We
have submitted.'“
112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son
of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for
us a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah,
if you are believers.'“
113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that
our hearts may be reassured, and know that
you have told us the truth, and be among
those who witness it.”
114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord,
send down for us a table from heaven, to be a
festival for us, for the first of us, and the last
111.

1. Praise
be to Allah, Who created the heavens
and the earth, and made the darkness and the
light. Yet those who disbelieve ascribe equals
to their Lord.

cided a term—a term determined by him. Yet

who submit.” And do not be among the idol-
aters.
15. Say, “I fear, should I defy my Lord, the pun-
ishment of a tremendous Day.”
16. Whoever is spared on that Day—He had
mercy on him. That is the clear victory.
17. If Allah touches you with adversity, none
can remove it except He. And if He touches
you with good—He is Capable of everything.
18. He is the Supreme over His servants. He is
the Wise, the Expert.
19. Say, “What thing is more solemn in testi-
mony?” Say, “Allah is Witness between you
and me. This Quran was revealed to me, that
I may warn you with it, and whomever it may
reach. Do you indeed testify that there are
other gods with Allah?” Say, “I myself do not
testify.” Say, “He is but One God, and I am
innocent of your idolatry.”
20. Those to whom We have given the Book
recognize it as they recognize their own chil-
dren; but those who have lost their souls do
not believe.
21. Who does greater wrong than someone
who fabricates lies against Allah, or denies
His revelations? The wrongdoers will not
succeed.
22. On the Day when We gather them all to-
gether, then say to the idolaters, “Where are
your idols, those you used to claim?”
23. Then their only argument will be to say,
“By Allah, our Lord, we were not idolaters.”
24. Look how they lied to themselves. And
what they invented deserted them.
25. Among them are those who listen to you;
but We place covers over their hearts, to pre-
vent them from understanding it, and heavi-
ness in their ears. Even if they see every sign,
they will not believe in it. Until, when they
come to you, to argue with you, those who
disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but
myths of the ancients.”
26. They keep others from it, and avoid it
themselves; but they ruin only their own
souls, and they do not realize.
3. He is Allah in the heavens and the earth. He
knows what you keep secret and what you
make public; and He knows what you earn.
4. Not one of their Lord’s signs comes to them,
but they turn away from it.
5. They denied the truth when it has come to
them; but soon will reach them the news of
what they used to ridicule.
6. Have they not considered how many gener-
ations We destroyed before them? We had
established them on earth more firmly than
We established you, and We sent the clouds
pouring down abundant rain on them, and
We made rivers flow beneath them. But We
destroyed them for their sins, and established
other civilizations after them.
7. Had We sent down upon you a book on pa-
per, and they had touched it with their hands,
those who disbelieve would have said, “This
is nothing but plain magic.”
8. And they say, “Why was an angel not sent
down to him.” Had We sent down an angel,
the matter would have been settled, and they
would not have been reprieved.
9. Had We made him an angel, We would
have made him a man, and confused them
when they are already confused.
10. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but
those who mocked them became besieged by
what they ridiculed.
11. Say, “Travel the earth and observe the final
fate of the deniers.”
12. Say, “To whom belongs what is in the heav-
ens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has
inscribed for Himself mercy. He will gather
you to the Day of Resurrection, in which
there is no doubt. Those who lost their souls
do not believe.
13. To Him belongs whatever rests in the night
and the day. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
14. Say, “Shall I take for myself a protector
other than Allah, Originator of the heavens
and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed?”
Say, “I am instructed to be the first of those
456. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
27. If only you could see, when they are made
to stand before the Fire; they will say, “If only
we could be sent back, and not reject the rev-
elations of our Lord, and be among the faith-
ful.”
28. What they used to conceal before will be-
come clear to them. And even if they were
sent back, they would revert to what they
were forbidden. They are liars.
29. And they say, “There is nothing but our life
in this world, and we will not be resurrected.”
30. If only you could see, when they are sta-
tioned before their Lord. He will say, “Is this
not real?” They will say, “Yes indeed, by our
Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the torment
for having disbelieved.”
31. Losers are those who deny the encounter
with Allah. Then, when the Hour comes
upon them suddenly, they will say, “Alas for
us, how we have neglected it.” And they will
carry their burdens on their backs—evil is
what they carry.
32. The life of this world is nothing but game
and distraction, but the Home of the Hereaf-
ter is better for those who are righteous. Do
you not understand?
33. We know that what they say grieves you. It
is not you they reject, but it is Allah's revela-
tions that the wicked deny.
34. Other messengers before you were re-
jected, but they endured rejection and perse-
cution until Our help came to them. There
can be no change to Allah’s words. News of
the Messengers has already reached you.
35. If you find their rejection hard to bear, then
if you can, seek a tunnel into the earth, or a
stairway into the heaven, and bring them a
sign. Had Allah willed, He could have gath-
ered them to guidance. So do not be of the ig-
norant.
36. Only those who listen will respond. As for
the dead, Allah will resurrect them; then to
Him they will be returned.
37. And they say, “If only a sign could come
down to him from his Lord.” Say, “Allah is
Able to send down a sign, but most of them
do not know.”
38. There is no animal on land, nor a bird fly-
ing with its wings, but are communities like
you. We neglected nothing in the Scripture.
Then to their Lord they will be gathered.
39. Those who reject Our revelations are deaf
and dumb, in total darkness. Whomever Al-
lah wills, He leaves astray; and whomever He
wills, He sets on a straight path.
40. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun-
ishment came upon you, or the Hour over-
took you, would you call upon any other than
Allah, if you are sincere?”
41. In fact, it is Him you will call upon; and if
He wills, he will remove what you called Him
for, and you will forget what you idolized.
42. We sent messengers to communities be-
fore you, and We afflicted them with suffer-
ing and hardship, that they may humble
themselves.
43. If only, when Our calamity came upon
them, they humbled themselves. But their
hearts hardened, and Satan made their deeds
appear good to them.
44. Then, when they disregarded what they
were reminded of, We opened for them the
gates of all things. Until, when they delighted
in what they were given, We seized them sud-
denly; and at once, they were in despair.
45. Thus the last remnant of the people who
did wrong was cut off. And praise be to Allah,
Lord of the Worlds.
46. Say, “Have you considered? If Allah took
away your hearing and your sight, and set a
seal on your hearts, what god other than Al-
lah would restore them to you?” Note how
We explain the revelations in various ways,
yet they still turn away.
47. Say, “Have you considered? if Allah's pun-
ishment descended on you suddenly or grad-
ually, would any be destroyed except the
wrongdoing people?”
48. We sent the messengers only as bearers of
good news and as warners. Those who believe

would have been settled. Allah is well aware
of the unjust.”
59. With Him are the keys of the unseen; none
knows them except He. And He knows eve-
rything on land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls
but He knows it; and there is not a single
grain in the darkness of earth, nor is there an-
ything wet or dry, but is in a clear record.
60. It is He Who takes you by night, and He
knows what you earn by day. Then He raises
you up in it, until a fixed term is fulfilled.
Then to Him is your return, then He will in-
form you of what you used to do.
61. He is the Conqueror over His servants, and
He sends guardians over you, until, when
death overtakes one of you, Our envoys take
him away, and they never fail.
62. Then they are brought back to Allah, their
True Master. Unquestionably, His is the
judgment, and He is the Swiftest of reckon-
ers.
63. Say, “Who delivers you from the darkness
of land and sea?” You call upon Him humbly
and inwardly: “If He delivers us from this,
We will surely be among the thankful.”
64. Say, “It is Allah who delivers you from it,
and from every disaster. Yet then you associ-
ate others with Him.”
65. Say, “He is Able to send upon you an afflic-
tion, from above you, or from under your
feet. Or He can divide you into factions, and
make you taste the violence of one another.
Note how We explain the revelations, so that
they may understand.”
66. But your people rejected it, though it is the
truth. Say, “I am not responsible for you.”
67. For every happening is a finality, and you
will surely know.
68. When you encounter those who gossip
about Our revelations, turn away from them,
until they engage in another topic. But should
Satan make you forget, do not sit after the
recollection with the wicked people.
and reform have nothing to fear, nor shall
they grieve.
49. But as for those who reject Our revelations,
torment will afflict them because of their de-
fiance.
50. Say, “I do not say to you that I possess the
treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the future,
nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I only
follow what is inspired to me.” Say, “Are the
blind and the seeing alike? Do you not
think?”
51. And warn with it those who fear to be gath-
ered before their Lord—they have no protec-
tor or intercessor apart from him—perhaps
they will grow in piety.
52. And do not drive away those who call upon
their Lord, morning and evening, seeking His
attention. You are not accountable for them
in any way, nor are they accountable for you
in any way. If you drive them away, you
would be one of the unjust.
53. Thus We try some of them by means of
others, that they may say, “Are these the ones
whom Allah has favored from among us?” Is
Allah not aware of the appreciative?
54. When those who believe in Our revelations
come to you, say, “Peace be upon you, your
Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself.
Whoever among you does wrong out of igno-
rance, and then repents afterwards and re-
forms—He is Forgiving and Merciful.”
55. Thus We explain the revelations, and ex-
pose the path of the unrighteous.
56. Say, “I am forbidden from worshiping
those you pray to besides Allah.” Say, “I will
not follow your desires; else I would be lost
and not be of those guided.”
57. Say, “I stand on clear evidence from my
Lord, and you have rejected Him. I do not
possess what you seek me to hasten; the deci-
sion belongs solely to Allah. He states the
truth, and He is the Best of Judges.”
58. Say, “If I possessed what you seek me to
hasten, the matter between you and me
476. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
set, he said, “O my people, I am innocent of
your idolatry.
79. I have directed my attention towards Him
Who created the heavens and the earth—a
monotheist—and I am not of the idolaters.”
80. And his people argued with him. He said,
“Do you argue with me about Allah, when He
has guided me? I do not fear what you asso-
ciate with Him, unless my Lord wills it. My
Lord comprehends all things in knowledge.
Will you not reconsider?
81. And why should I fear those you associate
with Him, and you do not fear associating
others with Allah for which He sent down to
you no authority? Which side is more enti-
tled to security, if you are aware?”
82. Those who believe, and do not obscure
their faith with wrongdoing—those will have
security, and they are guided.
83. That was Our argument which We gave to
Abraham against his people. We elevate by
degrees whomever We will. Your Lord is
Wise and Informed.
84. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob—each
of them We guided. And We guided Noah
previously; and from his descendants David,
and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Mo-
ses, and Aaron. Thus We reward the right-
eous.
85. And Zechariah, and John, and Jesus, and
Elias—every one of them was of the upright.
86. And Ishmael, and Elijah, and Jonah, and
Lot—We favored each one of them over all
other people.
87. And of their ancestors, and their descend-
ants, and their siblings—We chose them, and
guided them to a straight path.
88. Such is Allah’s guidance. He guides with it
whomever He wills of His servants. Had they
associated, their deeds would have gone in
vain.
89. Those are they to whom We gave the Book,
and wisdom, and prophethood. If these reject
them, We have entrusted them to others who
do not reject them.
The righteous are in no way accountable
for them; it is only a reminder, that they may
be careful.
70. So leave alone those who take their religion
for play and pastime, and whom the worldly
life has deceived. But remind with it, lest a
soul becomes damned on account of what it
has earned. It has no helper or intercessor be-
sides Allah. Even if it offers every equivalent,
none will be accepted from it. These are the
ones who are delivered to perdition by their
actions. They will have a drink of scalding
water, and a painful punishment, because
they used to disbelieve.
71. Say, “Shall we invoke besides Allah some-
thing that can neither benefit us nor harm us,
and turn back on our heels after Allah has
guided us; like someone seduced by the devils
and confused on earth, who has friends call-
ing him to guidance: 'Come to us'?” Say, “The
guidance of Allah is the guidance, and we are
commanded to surrender to the Lord of the
Universe.”
72. “And to perform the prayers, and to revere
Him; it is to Him that you will be gathered.”
73. It is He who created the heavens and the
earth in truth. On the Day when He says:
“Be,” it will be. His saying is the truth, and
His is the sovereignty on the Day when the
trumpet is blown. The Knower of secrets and
declarations. He is the Wise, the Expert.
74. Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you
take idols for gods? I see that you and your
people are in evident error.”
75. Thus We showed Abraham the empire of
the heavens and the earth, that he might be
one of those with certainty.
76. When the night fell over him, he saw a
planet. He said, “This is my lord.” But when
it set, he said, “I do not love those that set.”
77. Then, when he saw the moon rising, he
said, “This is my lord.” But when it set, he
said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will be
one of the erring people.”
78. Then, when he saw the sun rising, he said,
“This is my lord, this is bigger.” But when it

486. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
90. Those are they whom Allah has guided, so
follow their guidance. Say, “I ask of you no
compensation for it; it is just a reminder for
all mankind.”
91. They do not value Allah as He should be
valued, when they say, “Allah did not reveal
anything to any human being.” Say, “Who re-
vealed the Scripture which Moses brought—
a light and guidance for humanity?” You put
it on scrolls, displaying them, yet concealing
much. And you were taught what you did not
know—neither you, nor your ancestors. Say,
“Allah;” then leave them toying away in their
speculation.
92. This too is a Scripture that We revealed—
blessed—verifying what preceded it, that you
may warn the Mother of Cities and all around
it. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe
in it, and are dedicated to their prayers.
93. Who does greater wrong than someone
who invents falsehood against Allah, or says,
“It was revealed to me,” when nothing was re-
vealed to him, or says, “I will reveal the like of
what Allah revealed”? If only you could see
the wrongdoers in the floods of death, as the
angels with arms outstretched: “Give up your
souls. Today you are being repaid with the
torment of shame for having said about Allah
other than the truth, and for being too proud
to accept His revelations.”
94. “You have come to Us individually, just as
We created you the first time, leaving behind
you everything We gave you. We do not see
with you your intercessors—those you
claimed were your partners. The link be-
tween you is cut, and what you had asserted
has failed you.”
95. It is Allah Who splits the grain and the
seed. He brings the living from the dead, and
He brings the dead from the living. Such is
Allah. So how could you deviate?
96. It is He Who breaks the dawn. And He
made the night for rest, and the sun and the
moon for calculation. Such is the disposition
of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.
97. And it is He Who created the stars for you,
that you may be guided by them in the dark-
ness of land and sea. We thus explain the rev-
elations for people who know.
98. And it is He who produced you from a sin-
gle person, then a repository, then a deposi-
tory. We have detailed the revelations for
people who understand.
99. And it is He who sends down water from
the sky. With it We produce vegetation of all
kinds, from which We bring greenery, from
which We produce grains in clusters. And
palm-trees with hanging clusters, and vine-
yards, and olives, and pomegranates—similar
and dissimilar. Watch their fruits as they
grow and ripen. Surely in this are signs for
people who believe.
100. Yet they attributed to Allah partners—the
sprites—although He created them. And they
invented for Him sons and daughters, with-
out any knowledge. Glory be to Him. He is
exalted, beyond what they describe.
101. Originator of the heavens and the earth—
how can He have a son when He never had a
companion? He created all things, and He
has knowledge of all things.
102. Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no god
except He, the Creator of all things; so wor-
ship Him. He is responsible for everything.
103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is
over all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert.
104. “Insights have come to you from your
Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his
soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its
detriment. I am not a guardian over you.”
105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they
say, “You have studied,” and to clarify them
for people who know.
106. Follow what was revealed to you from
your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn
away from the polytheists.
107. Had Allah willed, they would not have
practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you as
a guardian over them, and you are not a man-
ager over them.
496. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
108. Do not insult those they call upon besides
Allah, lest they insult Allah out of hostility
and ignorance. We made attractive to every
community their deeds. Then to their Lord is
their return, and He will inform them of what
they used to do.
109. They swear by Allah, with their most sol-
emn oaths, that if a miracle were to come to
them, they would believe in it. Say, “The mir-
acles are only with Allah.” But how do you
know? Even if it did come, they still would
not believe.
110. And We turn away their hearts and their
visions, as they refused to believe in it the first
time, and We leave them blundering in their
rebellion.
111. Even if We sent down the angels to them,
and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered
all things before them, they still would not
believe, unless Allah wills; but most of them
are ignorant.
112. Likewise, We have assigned for every
prophet an enemy—human and jinn devils—
inspiring one another with fancy words in or-
der to deceive. But had your Lord willed, they
would not have done it. So leave them to their
fabrications.
113. So that the hearts of those who do not be-
lieve in the Hereafter may incline to it, and be
content with it, and that they may perpetrate
whatever they perpetrate.
114. “Shall I seek a judge other than Allah,
when He is the One who revealed to you the
Book, explained in detail?” Those to whom
We gave the Book know that it is the truth re-
vealed from your Lord. So do not be of those
who doubt.
115. The Word of your Lord has been com-
pleted, in truth and justice. There is no
changing to His words. He is the Hearer, the
Knower.
116. If you were to obey most of those on earth,
they would divert you from Allah’s path.
They follow nothing but assumptions, and
they only conjecture.
117. Your Lord knows best who strays from His
path, and He knows best the guided ones.
eat of that over which the Name of Al-
lah was pronounced, if you indeed believe in
His revelations.
119. And why should you not eat of that over
which the Name of Allah is pronounced,
when He has detailed for you what is prohib-
ited for you, unless you are compelled by ne-
cessity? Many lead astray with their opinions,
through lack of knowledge. Your Lord knows
best the transgressors.
120. So abandon sin, outward and inward.
Those who commit sins will be repaid for
what they used to perpetrate.
121. And do not eat from that over which the
Name of Allah was not pronounced, for it is
abomination. The devils inspire their follow-
ers to argue with you; but if you obey them,
you would be polytheists.
122. Is he who was dead, then We gave him life,
and made for him a light by which he walks
among the people, like he who is in total
darkness, and cannot get out of it? Thus the
doings of disbelievers are made to appear
good to them.
123. And thus We set up in every city its lead-
ing wicked sinners, to conspire in it, but they
conspire only against themselves, and they do
not realize it.
124. When a sign comes to them, they say, “We
will not believe unless we are given the like of
what was given to Allah’s messengers.” Allah
knows best where to place His message. Hu-
miliation from Allah and severe torment will
afflict the criminals for their scheming.
125. Whomever Allah desires to guide, He
spreads open his heart to Islam; and whom-
ever He desires to misguide, He makes his
heart narrow, constricted, as though he were
climbing up the sky. Allah thus lays defile-
ment upon those who do not believe.
126. This is the straight path of your Lord. We
have explained the revelations in detail for
people who recollect.
118. So
506. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
share of Allah reaches their idols. Evil is their
judgment.
137. Likewise, their idols entice many idolaters
to kill their children, in order to lead them to
their ruin, and confuse them in their religion.
Had Allah willed, they would not have done
it; so leave them to their fraud.
138. And they say, “These animals and crops
are restricted; none may eat them except
those we permit,” by their claims, and ani-
mals whose backs are forbidden, and animals
over which they do not pronounce the name
of Allah—fabricating lies against Him. He
will repay them for what they used to invent.
139. And they say, “What lies in the wombs of
these animals is exclusively for our males,
and prohibited to our wives.” But if it is still-
born, they can share in it. He will surely pun-
ish them for their allegations. He is Wise and
Knowing.
140. Lost are those who kill their children fool-
ishly, with no basis in knowledge, and forbid
what Allah has provided for them—innova-
tions about Allah. They have gone astray.
They are not guided.
141. It is He who produces gardens, both culti-
vated and wild, and date-palms, and crops of
diverse tastes, and olives and pomegranates,
similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it
yields, and give its due on the day of its har-
vest, and do not waste. He does not love the
wasteful.
142. Among the livestock are some for trans-
portation, and some for clothing. Eat of what
Allah has provided for you, and do not follow
the footsteps of Satan. He is to you an out-
right enemy.
143. Eight pairs: two of the sheep, and two of
the goats. Say, “Did He forbid the two males,
or the two females, or what the wombs of the
two females contain? Inform me with
knowledge, if you are truthful.”
144. And two of the camels, and two of the cat-
tle. Say, “Did He forbid the two males, or the
two females, or what the wombs of the two
127. For them is the Home of Peace with their
Lord, and He is their Master—because of
what they used to do.
128. On the Day when He gathers them all to-
gether: “O assembly of jinn, you have ex-
ploited multitudes of humans.” Their adher-
ents among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we
have profited from one another, but we have
reached the term that you have assigned for
us.” He will say, “The Fire is your dwelling,
wherein you will remain, except as Allah
wills. Your Lord is Wise and Informed.
129. Thus We make some of the wrongdoers
befriend one another, because of what they
used to do.
130. “O assembly of jinn and humans, did there
not come to you messengers from among
you, relating to you My revelations, and
warning you of the meeting of this Day of
yours?” They will say, “We testify against
ourselves.” The life of the world seduced
them. They will testify against themselves
that they were disbelievers.
131. That is because your Lord would not de-
stroy towns for injustice while their inhabit-
ants are unaware.
132. They all have ranks according to what they
did; and your Lord is not unaware of what
they do.
133. Your Lord is the Rich Beyond Need, the
Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He can do
away with you, and substitute whomever He
wills in your place, just as He produced you
from the descendants of another people.
134. What you are promised is coming, and
you cannot thwart it.
135. Say, “O my people! Work according to
your ability, and so will I.” You will come to
know to whom will belong the sequel of the
abode.” The wrongdoers will not prevail.
136. And they set aside for Allah a share of the
crops and the livestock He created, and they
say, “This is for Allah,” according to their
claim, “and this is for our idols.” But the share
of their idols does not reach Allah, yet the
516. LIVESTOCK (al-An’am)
outward or inward; and that you do not kill
the soul which Allah has sanctified—except
in the course of justice. All this He has en-
joined upon you, so that you may under-
stand.”
152. And do not come near the property of the
orphan, except with the best intentions, until
he reaches maturity. And give full weight and
full measure, equitably. We do not burden
any soul beyond its capacity. And when you
speak, be fair, even if it concerns a close rela-
tive. And fulfill your covenant with Allah. All
this He has enjoined upon you, so that you
may take heed.
153. This is My path, straight, so follow it. And
do not follow the other paths, lest they divert
you from His path. All this He has enjoined
upon you, that you may refrain from wrong-
doing.
154. Then We gave Moses the Scripture, per-
fect for the righteous, and explaining every-
thing clearly, and a beacon, and mercy, that
they may believe in the encounter with their
Lord.
155. This too is a blessed Scripture that We re-
vealed; so follow it, and be righteous, that you
may receive mercy.
156. Lest you say, “The Scripture was revealed
to two parties before us, and we were una-
ware of their teachings.”
157. Or lest you say, “Had the Scripture been
revealed to us, we would have been better
guided than they.” Clarification has come to
you from your Lord, and guidance, and
mercy. Who then does greater wrong than he
who gives the lie to Allah's messages, and
turns away from them? We will repay those
who turn away from Our messages with the
worst kind of punishment, because of their
turning away.
158. Are they waiting for anything but for the
angels to come to them, or for your Lord to
arrive, or for some of your Lord’s signs to
come? On the Day when some of your Lord’s
signs come, no soul will benefit from its faith
unless it had believed previously, or had
females contain? Were you present when Al-
lah enjoined this upon you?” Who does
greater wrong than he who invents lies and
attributes them to Allah, in order to mislead
people without knowledge? Allah does not
guide the wicked people.
145. Say, “In what was revealed to me, I find
nothing forbidden to a consumer who eats it,
except carrion, or spilled blood, or the flesh
of swine—because it is impure—or a sinful
offering dedicated to other than Allah. But if
someone is compelled by necessity, without
being deliberate or malicious—your Lord is
Forgiving and Merciful.
146. For the Jews We forbade everything with
claws. As of cattle and sheep: We forbade
them their fat, except what adheres to their
backs, or the entrails, or what is mixed with
bone. This is how We penalized them for
their inequity. We are indeed truthful.
147. If they accuse you of lying, say, “Your Lord
is Possessor of infinite mercy, but His wrath
cannot be averted from the guilty people.”
148. The polytheists will say, “Had Allah willed,
we would not have practiced idolatry, nor
would have our forefathers, nor would we
have prohibited anything.” Likewise those
before them lied, until they tasted Our might.
Say, “Do you have any knowledge that you
can produce for us? You follow nothing but
conjecture, and you only guess.”
149. Say, “To Allah belongs the conclusive ar-
gument. Had He willed, He would have
guided you all.”
150. Say, “Produce your witnesses who would
testify that Allah has prohibited this.” If they
testify, do not testify with them. And do not
follow the whims of those who deny Our rev-
elation, and those who do not believe in the
Hereafter, and those who equate others with
their Lord.
151. Say, “Come, let me tell you what your Lord
has forbidden you: that you associate nothing
with Him; that you honor your parents; that
you do not kill your children because of pov-
erty—We provide for you and for them; that
you do not come near indecencies, whether
527. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
earned goodness through its faith. Say, “Wait,
we too are waiting.”
159. As for those who divided their religion
and became sects—you have nothing to do
with them. Their case rests with Allah; then
He will inform them of what they used to do.
160. Whoever comes up with a good deed will
have ten times its like; and whoever comes up
with an evil deed will be repaid only with its
equivalent—they will not be wronged.
161. Say, “My Lord has guided me to a straight
path, an upright religion, the creed of Abra-
ham the Monotheist, who was not a polythe-
ist.”
162. Say, “My prayer and my worship, and my
life and my death, are devoted to Allah, the
Lord of the Worlds.
163. No associate has He. Thus I am com-
manded, and I am the first of those who sub-
mit.
164. Say, “Am I to seek a Lord other than Allah,
when He is the Lord of all things?” No soul
gets except what it is due, and no soul bears
the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is
your return, then He will inform you regard-
ing your disputes.
165. It is He who made you successors on the
earth, and raised some of you in ranks over
others, in order to test you through what He
has given you. Your Lord is Quick in retribu-
tion, and He is Forgiving and Merciful.
4. How many a town have We destroyed? Our
might came upon them by night, or while
they were napping.
5. When Our might came upon them, their
only cry was, “We were indeed wrongdoers.”
6. We will question those to whom messen-
gers were sent, and We will question the mes-
sengers.
7. We will narrate to them with knowledge,
for We were never absent.
8. The scales on that Day will be just. Those
whose weights are heavy—it is they who are
the successful.
9. But as for those whose weights are light—it
is they who have lost their souls, because they
used to mistreat Our revelations.
10. We have established you firmly on earth,
and made for you in it livelihood—but rarely
do you give thanks.
11. We created you, then We shaped you, then
We said to the angels, “Bow down before
Adam;” so they bowed down, except for Sa-
tan; he was not of those who bowed down.
12. He said, “What prevented you from bow-
ing down when I have commanded you?” He
said, “I am better than he; You created me
from fire, and You created him from mud.”
13. He said, “Get down from it! It is not for you
to act arrogantly in it. Get out! You are one of
the lowly!”
14. He said, “Give me respite, until the Day
they are resurrected.”
7. THE ELEVATIONS

15. He
said, “You are of those given respite.”
said, “Because you have lured me, I will
waylay them on Your straight path.
17. Then I will come at them from before
them, and from behind them, and from their
right, and from their left; and you will not
find most of them appreciative.”
18. He said, “Get out of it, despised and van-
quished. Whoever among them follows
you—I will fill up Hell with you all.
19. And you, Adam, inhabit the Garden, you
and your wife, and eat whatever you wish; but

Scripture was revealed to you, so let there
be no anxiety in your heart because of it. You
are to warn with it—and a reminder for the

Lord, and do not follow other masters beside
Him. Little you recollect.

Him alone. Just as He originated you, so you
will return.”
30. Some He has guided, and some have de-
served misguidance. They have adopted the
devils for patrons rather than Allah, and they
assume that they are guided.
31. O Children of Adam! Dress properly at
every place of worship, and eat and drink, but
do not be excessive. He does not love the ex-
cessive.
32. Say, “Who forbade Allah’s finery which He
has produced for His servants, and the de-
lights of livelihood?” Say, “They are for those
who believe, in this present world, but exclu-
sively theirs on the Day of Resurrection.” We
thus detail the revelations for people who
know.
33. Say, “My Lord has forbidden immorali-
ties—both open and secret—and sin, and un-
justified aggression, and that you associate
with Allah anything for which He revealed no
sanction, and that you say about Allah what
you do not know.”
34. For every nation is an appointed time.
When their time has come, they cannot delay
it by one hour, nor can they advance it.
35. O Children of Adam! When messengers
from among you come to you, relating to you
My revelations—whoever practices piety and
reforms—upon them shall be no fear, nor
shall they grieve.
36. But as for those who reject Our revelations,
and are too proud to accept them—these are
the inmates of the Fire, where they will re-
main forever.
37. Who does greater wrong than he who in-
vents lies about Allah, or denies His revela-
tions? These—their share of the decree will
reach them. Until, when Our envoys come to
them, to take their souls away, they will say,
“Where are they whom you used to pray to
besides Allah?” They will say, “They have
abandoned us,” and they will testify against
themselves that they were faithless.
38. He will say, “Join the crowds of jinn and
humans who have gone into the Fire before
do not approach this tree, lest you become
sinners.”
20. But Satan whispered to them, to reveal to
them their nakedness, which was invisible to
them. He said, “Your Lord has only forbid-
den you this tree, lest you become angels, or
become immortals.”
21. And he swore to them, “I am a sincere ad-
visor to you.”
22. So he lured them with deceit. And when
they tasted the tree, their nakedness became
evident to them, and they began covering
themselves with the leaves of the Garden.
And their Lord called out to them, “Did I not
forbid you from this tree, and say to you that
Satan is a sworn enemy to you?”
23. They said, “Our Lord, we have done wrong
to ourselves. Unless You forgive us, and have
mercy on us, we will be among the losers.”
24. He said, “Fall, some of you enemies to one
another. On earth you will have residence
and livelihood for a while.”
25. He said, “In it you will live, and in it you
will die, and from it you will be brought out.”
26. O children of Adam! We have provided
you with clothing to cover your bodies, and
for luxury. But the clothing of piety—that is
best. These are some of Allah’s revelations, so
that they may take heed.
27. O Children of Adam! Do not let Satan se-
duce you, as he drove your parents out of the
Garden, stripping them of their garments, to
show them their nakedness. He sees you, him
and his clan, from where you cannot see
them. We have made the devils friends of
those who do not believe.
28. And when they commit an indecency, they
say, “We found our parents doing this, and
Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “Al-
lah does not command indecencies. Are you
attributing to Allah what you do not know?”
29. Say, “My Lord commands justice, and to
stand devoted at every place of worship. So
call upon Him, and dedicate your faith to
547. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
you.” They have not entered it, but they are
hoping.
47. And when their eyes are directed towards
the inmates of the Fire, they will say, “Our
Lord, do not place us among the wrongdoing
people.”
48. And the dwellers of the Elevations will call
to men they recognize by their features, say-
ing, “Your hoardings did not avail you, nor
did your arrogance.”
49. “Are these the ones you swore Allah will
not touch with mercy?” “Enter the Garden;
you have nothing to fear, and you will not
grieve.”
50. The inmates of the Fire will call on the in-
habitants of the Garden, “Pour some water
over us, or some of what Allah has provided
for you.” They will say, “Allah has forbidden
them for the disbelievers.”
51. Those who took their religion lightly, and
in jest, and whom the worldly life deceived.
Today We will ignore them, as they ignored
the meeting on this Day of theirs, and they
used to deny Our revelations.
52. We have given them a Scripture, which We
detailed with knowledge—guidance and
mercy for people who believe.
53. Are they waiting for anything but its fulfill-
ment? The Day its fulfillment comes true,
those who disregarded it before will say, “The
messengers of our Lord did come with the
truth. Have we any intercessors to intercede
for us? Or, could we be sent back, to behave
differently from the way we behaved before?”
They ruined their souls, and what they used
to invent has failed them.
54. Your Lord is Allah; He who created the
heavens and the earth in six days, then estab-
lished Himself on the Throne. The night
overtakes the day, as it pursues it persistently;
and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are
subservient by His command. His is the cre-
ation, and His is the command. Blessed is Al-
lah, Lord of all beings.
55. Call upon your Lord humbly and privately.
He does not love the aggressors.
you.” Every time a crowd enters, it will curse
its sister-crowd. Until, when they are all in it,
the last of them will say to the first of them,
“Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us,
so inflict on them a double punishment in the
Fire.” He will say, “Each will have a double,
but you do not know.”
39. The first of them will say to the last of them,
“You have no advantage over us, so taste the
torment for what you used to earn.”
40. Those who reject Our revelations and are
too arrogant to uphold them—the doors of
Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will
they enter Paradise, until the camel passes
through the eye of the needle. Thus We repay
the guilty.
41. For them is a couch of hell, and above them
are sheets of fire. Thus We repay the wrong-
doers.
42. As for those who believe and do righteous
works—We never burden any soul beyond its
capacity—these are the inhabitants of the
Garden; abiding therein eternally.
43. We will remove whatever rancor is in their
hearts. Rivers will flow beneath them. And
they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has
guided us to this. Had Allah not guided us,
we would never be guided. The messengers of
our Lord did come with the truth.” And it will
be proclaimed to them, “This is the Garden
you are made to inherit, on account of what
you used to do.”
44. And the inhabitants of the Garden will call
out to the inmates of the Fire, “We found
what our Lord promised us to be true; did
you find what your Lord promised you to be
true?” They will say, “Yes.” Thereupon a
caller will announce in their midst, “The
curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.”
45. “Those who hinder from the path of Allah,
and seek to distort it, and who deny the Here-
after.”
46. And between them is a partition, and on
the Elevations are men who recognize every-
one by their features. They will call to the in-
habitants of the Garden, “Peace be upon
557. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
56. And do not corrupt on earth after its refor-
mation, and pray to Him with fear and hope.
Allah’s mercy is close to the doers of good.
57. It is He who sends the wind ahead of His
mercy. Then, when they have gathered up
heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land,
where We make water come down, and with
it We bring out all kinds of fruits. Thus We
bring out the dead—perhaps you will reflect.
58. As for the good land, it yields its produce
by the leave of its Lord. But as for the bad, it
produces nothing but hardship and misery.
Thus We explain the revelations in various
ways for people who are thankful.
59. We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god
other than Him. I fear for you the punish-
ment of a tremendous Day.”
60. The dignitaries among his people said,
“We see that you are in obvious error.”
61. He said, “O my people, I am not in error,
but I am a messenger from the Lord of the
Worlds.”
62. “I deliver to you the messages of my Lord,
and I advise you, and I know from Allah what
you do not know.”
63. “Do you wonder that a reminder has come
to you from your Lord, through a man from
among you, to warn you, and to lead you to
righteousness, so that you may attain
mercy?”
64. But they called him a liar. So We saved him
and those with him in the Ark, and We
drowned those who rejected Our revelations.
They were blind people.
65. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O
my people! Worship Allah; you have no god
other than Him. Will you not take heed?”
66. The elite of his people who disbelieved
said, “We see foolishness in you, and we think
that you are a liar.”
67. He said, “O my people! There is no foolish-
ness in me, but I am a messenger from the
Lord of the Worlds.
68. “I
convey to you the messages of my Lord,
and I am a trustworthy adviser to you.”
69. “Are you surprised that a reminder has
come to you from your Lord, through a man
from among you, to warn you? Remember
how He made you successors after the people
of Noah, and increased you greatly in stature.
And remember Allah’s blessings, so that you
may prosper.”
70. They said, “Did you come to us to make us
worship Allah alone, and abandon what our
ancestors used to worship? Then bring us
what you threaten us with, if you are truth-
ful.”
71. He said, “Condemnation and wrath have
befallen you from your Lord. Are you arguing
with me over names, which you and your an-
cestors invented, for which Allah sent down
no authority? Just wait; I am waiting with
you.”
72. So We saved him and those with him, by
mercy from Us, and We cut off the roots of
those who rejected Our revelations and were
not believers.
73. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He
said, “O my people! Worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. Clarification has
come to you from your Lord. This she-camel
of Allah is a sign for you. So leave her to graze
on Allah’s earth, and do her no harm, lest a
painful penalty seizes you.”
74. “And remember how He made you succes-
sors after Aad, and settled you in the land.
You make for yourselves mansions on its
plains, and carve out dwellings in the moun-
tains. So remember Allah’s benefits, and do
not roam the earth corruptingly.”
75. The elite of his people, who were arrogant,
said to the common people who had believed,
“Do you know that Saleh is sent from his
Lord?” They said, “We are believers in what
he was sent with.”
76. Those who were arrogant said, “We reject
what you believe in.”
77. So they hamstrung the she-camel, and de-
fied the command of their Lord, and said, “O
567. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
Saleh, bring upon us what you threaten us
with, if you are one of the messengers.”
78. Whereupon the quake overtook them, and
they became lifeless bodies in their homes.
79. Then he turned away from them, and said,
“O my people, I have delivered to you the
message of my Lord, and I have advised you,
but you do not like those who give advice.”
80. And Lot, when he said to his people, “Do
you commit lewdness no people anywhere
have ever committed before you?”
81. “You lust after men rather than women.
You are an excessive people.”
82. And his people's only answer was to say,
“Expel them from your town; they are purist
people.”
83. But We saved him and his family, except
for his wife; she was of those who lagged be-
hind.
84. And We rained down on them a rain; note
the consequences for the sinners.
85. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He
said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. A clear proof has
come to you from your Lord. Give full meas-
ure and weight, and do not cheat people out
of their rights, and do not corrupt the land
once it has been set right. This is better for
you, if you are believers.”
86. “And do not lurk on every path, making
threats and turning away from the path of Al-
lah those who believe in Him, seeking to dis-
tort it. And remember how you were few, and
how He made you numerous. So note the
consequences for the corrupters.”
87. “Since some of you believed in what I was
sent with, and some did not believe, be pa-
tient until Allah judges between us; for He is
the Best of Judges.”
88. The arrogant elite among his people said,
“O Shuaib, We will evict you from our town,
along with those who believe with you, unless
you return to our religion.” He said, “Even if
we are unwilling?”
89. “We would be fabricating falsehood
against Allah, if we were to return to your re-
ligion, after Allah has saved us from it. It is
not for us to return to it, unless Allah, our
Lord, wills. Our Lord embraces all things in
knowledge. In Allah we place our trust. Our
Lord, decide between us and our people in
truth, for You are the Best of Deciders.”
90. The elite of his people who disbelieved
said, “If you follow Shuaib, you will be los-
ers.”
91. Thereupon, the quake struck them; and
they became lifeless bodies in their homes.
92. Those who rejected Shuaib—as if they
never prospered therein. Those who rejected
Shuaib—it was they who were the losers.
93. So he turned away from them, and said, “O
my people, I have delivered to you the mes-
sages of my Lord, and I have advised you, so
why should I grieve over a disbelieving peo-
ple?”
94. We did not send any prophet to any town
but We afflicted its people with misery and
adversity, so that they may humble them-
selves.
95. Then We substituted prosperity in place of
hardship. Until they increased in number,
and said, “Adversity and prosperity has
touched our ancestors.” Then We seized
them suddenly, while they were unaware.
96. Had the people of the towns believed and
turned righteous, We would have opened for
them the blessings of the heaven and the
earth; but they rejected the truth, so We
seized them by what they were doing.
97. Do the people of the towns feel secure that
Our might will not come upon them by night,
while they sleep?
98. Do the people of the towns feel secure that
Our might will not come upon them by day,
while they play?
99. Do they feel safe from Allah’s plan? None
feel safe from Allah’s plan except the losing
people.
577. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
100. Is it not guidance for those who inherit the
land after its inhabitants, that if We willed,
We could strike them for their sins? And seal
up their hearts, so that they would not hear?
101. These towns—We narrate to you some of
their tales. Their messengers came to them
with the clear signs, but they would not be-
lieve in what they had rejected previously.
Thus Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.
102. We found most of them untrue to their
covenants; We found most of them corrupt.
103. Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our
miracles to Pharaoh and his establishment,
but they denounced them. So consider the
end of the evildoers.
104. Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger
from the Lord of the Worlds.”
105. “It is only proper that I should not say
about Allah anything other than the truth. I
have come to you with clear evidence from
your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go
with me.”
106. He said, “If you brought a miracle, then
present it, if you are truthful.”
107. So he threw his staff, and it was an appar-
ent serpent.
108. And He pulled out his hand, and it was
white to the onlookers.
109. The notables among Pharaoh’s people
said, “This is really a skilled magician.”
110. “He wants to evict you from your land, so
what do you recommend?”
111. They said, “Put him off, and his brother,
and send heralds to the cities.”
112. “And let them bring you every skillful ma-
gician.”
113. The magicians came to Pharaoh, and said,
“Surely there is a reward for us, if we are the
victors.”
114. He said, “Yes, and you will be among my
favorites.”
115. They said, “O Moses! Either you throw, or
we are the ones to throw.”
He said, “You throw!” And when they
threw, they beguiled the eyes of the people,
and intimidated them, and produced a
mighty magic.
117. And We inspired Moses: “Throw your
staff.” And at once, it swallowed what they
were faking.
118. So the truth came to pass, and what they
were producing came to nothing.
119. There they were defeated, and utterly re-
duced.
116.
120. And
the magicians fell to their knees.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord
of the Worlds.”
121.
122. “The
Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
said, “Did you believe in Him be-
fore I have given you permission? This is
surely a conspiracy you schemed in the city,
in order to expel its people from it. You will
surely know.”
124. “I will cut off your hands and your feet on
opposite sides; then I will crucify you all.”
125. They said, “It is to our Lord that we will
return.”
126. “You are taking vengeance on us only be-
cause we have believed in the signs of our
Lord when they have come to us.” “Our Lord!
Pour out patience upon us, and receive our
souls in submission.”
127. The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, “Will
you let Moses and his people cause trouble in
the land, and forsake you and your gods?” He
said, “We will kill their sons, and spare their
women. We have absolute power over them.”
128. Moses said to his people, “Seek help in Al-
lah, and be patient. The earth belongs to Al-
lah. He gives it in inheritance to whomever
He wills of His servants, and the future be-
longs to the righteous.”
129. They said, “We were persecuted before
you came to us, and after you came to us.” He
said, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your
enemy, and make you successors in the land;
then He will see how you behave.”
123. Pharaoh
587. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
And We afflicted the people of Pharaoh
with barren years, and with shortage of crops,
that they may take heed.
131. When something good came their way,
they said, “This is ours.” And when some-
thing bad happened to them, they ascribed
the evil omen to Moses and those with him.
In fact, their omen is with Allah, but most of
them do not know.
132. And they said, “No matter what sign you
bring us, to bewitch us with, we will not be-
lieve in you.”
133. So We let loose upon them the flood, and
the locusts, and the lice, and the frogs, and
blood—all explicit signs—but they were too
arrogant. They were a sinful people.
134. Whenever a plague befell them, they
would say, “O Moses, pray to your Lord for
us, according to the covenant He made with
you. If you lift the plague from us, we will be-
lieve in you, and let the Children of Israel go
with you.”
135. But when We lifted the plague from them,
for a term they were to fulfill, they broke their
promise.
136. So We took vengeance on them, and
drowned them in the sea—because they re-
jected Our signs, and paid no heed to them.
137. And We made the oppressed people in-
herit the eastern and western parts of the
land, which We had blessed. Thus the fair
promise of your Lord to the Children of Israel
was fulfilled, because of their endurance. And
We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people
had built, and what they had harvested.
138. And We delivered the Children of Israel
across the sea. And when they came upon a
people who were devoted to some statues of
theirs, they said, “O Moses, make for us a god,
as they have gods.” He said, “You are truly an
ignorant people.”
139. “What these people are concerned with is
perdition, and their deeds are based on false-
hoods.”
140. He said, “Shall I seek for you a god other
than Allah, when He has favored you over all
other people?”
141. Remember how We saved you from Phar-
aoh’s people, who subjected you to the worst
of sufferings—killing your sons and sparing
your women. In that was a tremendous trial
from your Lord.
142. And We appointed to Moses thirty nights,
and completed them with ten; and thus the
time appointed by his Lord was forty nights.
And Moses said to his brother Aaron: “Take
my place among my people, and be upright,
and do not follow the way of the mischief-
makers.”
143. And when Moses came to Our appoint-
ment, and his Lord spoke to him, he said,
“My Lord, allow me to look and see You.” He
said, “You will not see Me, but look at the
mountain; if it stays in its place, you will see
Me.” But when his Lord manifested Himself
to the mountain, He turned it into dust, and
Moses fell down unconscious. Then, when he
recovered, he said, “Glory be to you, I repent
to you, and I am the first of the believers.”
144. He said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over
all people for My messages and for My
Words. So take what I have given you, and be
one of the thankful.”
145. And We inscribed for him in the Tablets
all kinds of enlightenments, and decisive ex-
planation of all things. “Hold fast to them,
and exhort your people to adopt the best of
them. I will show you the fate of the sinners.”
146. I will turn away from My revelations those
who behave proudly on earth without justifi-
cation. Even if they see every sign, they will
not believe in it; and if they see the path of
rectitude, they will not adopt it for a path; and
if they see the path of error, they will adopt it
for a path. That is because they denied Our
revelations, and paid no attention to them.
147. Those who deny Our revelations and the
meeting of the Hereafter—their deeds will
come to nothing. Will they be repaid except
according to what they used to do?
130.

compasses all things. I will specify it for those

charity, and those who believe in Our signs.”
157. Those who follow the Messenger, the Un-
lettered Prophet, whom they find mentioned
in the Torah and the Gospel in their posses-
sion. He directs them to righteousness, and
deters them from evil, and allows for them all
good things, and prohibits for them wicked-
ness, and unloads the burdens and the shack-
les that are upon them. Those who believe in
him, and respect him, and support him, and
follow the light that came down with him—
these are the successful.
158. Say, “O people, I am the Messenger of Al-
lah to you all—He to whom belongs the king-
dom of the heavens and the earth. There is no
god but He. He gives life and causes death.”
So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the
Unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah
and His words. And follow him, that you may
be guided.
159. Among the people of Moses is a commu-
nity that guides by truth, and thereby does
justice.
160. We divided them into twelve tribal com-
munities. And We inspired Moses, when his
people asked him for something to drink:
“Strike the rock with your staff.” Whereupon
twelve springs gushed from it. Each group
recognized its drinking-place. And We
shaded them with clouds, and We sent down
upon them manna and quails: “Eat of the
good things We have provided for you.” They
did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong
their own selves.
161. And it was said to them, “Settle this town,
and eat therein whatever you wish, and speak
modestly, and enter the gate in humility—
We will forgive your sins, and will promote
the righteous.”
162. But the wicked among them substituted
other words for the words given to them; so
We sent down upon them a plague from the
sky, because of their wrongdoing.
In his absence, the people of Moses
adopted a calf made from their ornaments—
a body which lowed. Did they not see that it
could not speak to them, nor guide them in
any way? They took it for worship. They were
in the wrong.
149. Then, when they regretted, and realized
that they had erred, they said, “Unless our
Lord extends His mercy to us, and forgives
us, we will be among the losers.”
150. And when Moses returned to his people,
angry and disappointed, he said, “What an
awful thing you did in my absence. Did you
forsake the commandments of your Lord so
hastily?” And he threw down the tablets; and
he took hold of his brother’s head, dragging
him towards himself. He said, “Son of my
mother, the people have overpowered me,
and were about to kill me; so do not allow the
enemies to gloat over me, and do not count
me among the unjust people.”
151. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and my
brother, and admit us into Your mercy; for
you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”
152. Those who idolized the calf have incurred
wrath from their Lord, and humiliation in
this life. We thus requite the innovators.
153. As for those who commit sins, and then
repent afterwards and believe—your Lord,
thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.
154. When the anger abated in Moses, he took
up the tablets. In their transcript is guidance
and mercy for those in awe of their Lord.
155. And Moses chose from his people seventy
men for Our appointment. When the tremor
shook them, he said, “My Lord, had You
willed, You could have destroyed them be-
fore, and me too. Will you destroy us for what
the fools among us have done? This is but
Your test—with it You misguide whomever
You will, and guide whomever You will. You
are our Protector, so forgive us, and have
mercy on us. You are the Best of Forgivers.”
156. “And inscribe for us goodness in this
world, and in the Hereafter. We have turned
to You.” He said, “My punishment—I inflict
148.
607. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
what We have given you, and remember what
it contains, so that you may be saved.”
172. And when Your Lord summoned the de-
scendants of Adam, and made them testify
about themselves. “Am I not your Lord?”
They said, “Yes, we testify.” Thus you cannot
say on the Day of Resurrection, “We were un-
aware of this.”
173. Nor can you Say, “Our ancestors practiced
idolatry before; and we are their descendants
who came after them; will you destroy us for
what the falsifiers did?”
174. We thus elaborate the revelations, so that
they may return.
175. And relate to them the story of him to
whom We delivered Our signs, but he de-
tached himself from them, so Satan went af-
ter him, and he became one of the perverts.
176. Had We willed, We could have elevated
him through them; but he clung to the
ground, and followed his desires. His meta-
phor is that of a dog: if you chase it, it pants;
and if you leave it alone, it pants. Such is the
metaphor of the people who deny Our signs.
So tell the tale, so that they may ponder.
177. Evil is the metaphor of the people who re-
ject Our signs and wrong themselves.
178. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one.
And whomever He sends astray—these are
the losers.
179. We have destined for Hell multitudes of
jinn and humans. They have hearts with
which they do not understand. They have
eyes with which they do not see. They have
ears with which they do not hear. These are
like cattle. In fact, they are further astray.
These are the heedless.
180. To Allah belong the Most Beautiful
Names, so call Him by them, and disregard
those who blaspheme His names. They will
be repaid for what they used to do.
181. Among those We created is a commu-
nity—they guide by truth, and do justice
thereby.
163. Ask them about the town by the sea, when
they violated the Sabbath. When they ob-
served the Sabbath, their fish would come to
them abundantly. But when they violated the
Sabbath, their fish would not come to them.
Thus We tried them because they disobeyed.
164. And when a group of them said, “Why do
you counsel a people whom Allah will anni-
hilate, or punish with a severe punishment?”
They said, “As an excuse to your Lord, and so
that they may become righteous.”
165. Then, when they neglected what they were
reminded of, We saved those who prohibited
evil, and We seized those who did wrong with
a terrible punishment, because of their sinful-
ness.
166. Then, when they rebelled against the com-
mands to refrain, We said to them, “Be des-
picable apes.”
167. Your Lord has announced that, He would
send against them, until the Day of Resurrec-
tion, those who would inflict terrible suffer-
ing upon them. Your Lord is swift in retribu-
tion, yet He is Forgiving and Merciful.
168. And We scattered them into communities
on earth. Some of them righteous, and some
of them short of that. And We tested them
with fortunes and misfortunes, so that they
may return.
169. They were succeeded by generations who
inherited the Scripture and chose the materi-
als of this world, saying, “We will be for-
given.” And should similar materials come
their way, they would again seize them. Did
they not make a covenant to uphold the
Scripture, and to not say about Allah except
the truth? Did they not study its contents?
But the Home of the Hereafter is better for
the cautious; will you not understand?
170. Those who adhere to the Scripture, and
practice prayer—We will not waste the re-
ward of the reformers.
171. And when We suspended the mountain
over them, as if it was an umbrella, and they
thought it would fall on them: “Hold fast to
617. THE ELEVATIONS (al-A’raf)
182. As for those who reject Our messages, We
will gradually lead them from where they do
not know.
183. And I will encourage them. My plan is
firm.
184. Do they not think? There is no madness in
their friend. He is but a plain warner.
185. Have they not observed the government of
the heavens and the earth, and all the things
that Allah created, and that their time may
have drawn near? Which message, besides
this, will they believe in?
186. Whomever Allah misguides has no guide.
And He leaves them blundering in their
transgression.
187. They ask you about the Hour, “When will
it come?” Say, “Knowledge of it rests with my
Lord. None can reveal its coming except He.
It weighs heavily on the heavens and the
earth. It will not come upon you except sud-
denly.” They ask you as if you are responsible
for it. Say, “Knowledge of it rests with Allah,”
but most people do not know.
188. Say, “I have no control over any benefit or
harm to myself, except as Allah wills. Had I
known the future, I would have acquired
much good, and no harm would have
touched me. I am only a warner, and a herald
of good news to a people who believe.”
189. It is He who created you from a single per-
son, and made from it its mate, that he may
find comfort with her. Then, when he has
covered her, she conceives a light load, and
she carries it around. But when she has grown
heavy, they pray to Allah their Lord, “if You
give us a good child, we will be among the
thankful.”
190. But when He has given them a good child,
they attribute partners to Him in what He has
given them. Allah is exalted above what they
associate.
191. Do they idolize those who create nothing,
and are themselves created?
192. And can neither help them, nor help their
own selves?
And if you invite them to guidance, they
will not follow you. It is the same for you,
whether you invite them, or remain silent.
194. Those you call upon besides Allah are
servants like you. So call upon them, and let
them answer you, if you are truthful.
195. Do they have feet with which they walk?
Or do they have hands with which they
strike? Or do they have eyes with which they
see? Or do they have ears with which they
hear? Say, “Call upon your partners, then plot
against me, and do not wait.”
196. “My Master is Allah, He Who sent down
the Book, and He takes care of the righteous.”
197. Those you call upon besides Him cannot
help you, nor can they help themselves.
198. And if you call them to guidance, they will
not hear. And you see them looking at you,
yet they do not see.
199. Be tolerant, and command decency, and
avoid the ignorant.
200. And when a suggestion from Satan assails
you, take refuge with Allah. He is Hearing
and Knowing.
201. Those who are righteous—when an im-
pulse from Satan strikes them, they remind
themselves, and immediately see clearly.
202. But their brethren lead them relentlessly
into error, and they never stop short.
203. If you do not produce a miracle for them,
they say, “Why don’t you improvise one.”
Say, “I only follow what is inspired to me
from my Lord.” These are insights from your
Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for a people
who believe.
204. When the Quran is recited, listen to it, and
pay attention, so that you may experience
mercy.
205. And remember your Lord within yourself,
humbly and fearfully, and quietly, in the
morning and the evening, and do not be of
the neglectful.
206. Those who are in the presence of your
Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They

you water from the sky, to cleanse you with
it, and to rid you of Satan’s pollution, and to
fortify your hearts, and to strengthen your
foothold.
12. Your Lord inspired the angels: “I am with
you, so support those who believe. I will cast
terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve.
So strike above the necks, and strike off every
fingertip of theirs.”
13. That is because they opposed Allah and His
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah and His
Messenger—Allah is severe in retribution.
14. “Here it is; so taste it.” For the disbelievers
there is the suffering of the Fire.
15. O you who believe! When you meet those
who disbelieve on the march, never turn your
backs on them.
16. Anyone who turns his back on them on that Day, except while maneuvering for bat-
tle, or to join another group, has incurred
wrath from Allah, and his abode is Hell!

17. It was not you who killed them, but it was
Allah who killed them. And it was not you
who launched when you launched, but it was
Allah who launched. That He may bestow
upon the believers an excellent reward. Allah
is Hearing and Knowing.
18. Such is the case. Allah will undermine the
strategy of the disbelievers.

19. If you desire a verdict, the verdict has come
to you. 

And if you desist, it would be best for
you. And if you return, We will return; and
your troops, however numerous, will not
benefit you. Allah is with the believers.
<!-- 20. O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him
when you hear. -->
21. And be not like those who say, “We hear,” when they do not hear.
22. The worst of animals to Allah are the deaf and dumb—those who do not reason.
23. Had Allah recognized any good in them, He would have made them hear; and had He
recite His praises, and to Him they bow down.
