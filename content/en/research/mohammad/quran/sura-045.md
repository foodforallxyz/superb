45. KNEELING (al-Jathiyah)

1. Ha, Meem.
The revelation of the Book is from Allah,
the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
3. In the heavens and the earth are proofs for
the believers.
4. And in your own creation, and in the crea-
tures He scattered, are signs for people of
firm faith.
5. And in the alternation of night and day, and
in the sustenance Allah sends down from the
sky, with which He revives the earth after its
death, and in the circulation of the winds, are
marvels for people who reason.
6. These are Allah’s Verses which We recite to
you in truth. In which message, after Allah
and His revelations, will they believe?
7. Woe to every sinful liar.
hears Allah's revelations being recited
to him, yet he persists arrogantly, as though
he did not hear them. Announce to him a
painful punishment.
9. And when he learns something of Our rev-
elations, he takes them in mockery. For such
there is a shameful punishment.
10. Beyond them lies Hell. What they have
earned will not benefit them at all, nor will
those they adopted as lords instead of Allah.
They will have a terrible punishment.
11. This is guidance. Those who blaspheme
their Lord’s revelations will have a punish-
ment of agonizing pain.
12. It is Allah who placed the sea at your ser-
vice, so that ships may run through it by His
command, and that you may seek of His
bounty, and that you may give thanks.
13. And He placed at your service whatever is
in the heavens and whatever is on earth—all
is from Him. In that are signs for a people
who think.
14. Tell those who believe to forgive those who
do not hope for the Days of Allah. He will
8. Who
fully recompense people for whatever they
have earned.
15. Whoever does a good deed, it is for his soul;
and whoever commits evil, it is against it;
then to your Lord you will be returned.
16. We gave the Children of Israel the Book,
and wisdom, and prophecy; and We pro-
vided them with the good things; and We
gave them advantage over all other people.
17. And We gave them precise rulings. They
fell into dispute only after knowledge came to
them, out of mutual rivalry. Your Lord will
judge between them on the Day of Resurrec-
tion regarding the things they differed about.
18. Then We set you upon a pathway of faith,
so follow it, and do not follow the inclina-
tions of those who do not know.
19. They will not help you against Allah in any
way. The wrongdoers are allies of one an-
other, while Allah is the Protector of the
righteous.
20. This is an illumination for mankind, and
guidance, and mercy for people who believe
with certainty.
21. Do those who perpetrate the evil deeds as-
sume that We will regard them as equal to
those who believe and do righteous deeds,
whether in their life or their death? Evil is
their judgment!
22. Allah created the heavens and the earth
with justice, so that every soul will be repaid
for what it has earned. And they will not be
wronged.
23. Have you considered him who has taken
his desire for his god? Allah has knowingly
led him astray, and has sealed his hearing and
his heart, and has placed a veil over his vision.
Who will guide him after Allah? Will you not
reflect?
24. And they say, “There is nothing but this
our present life; we die and we live, and noth-
ing destroys us except time.” But they have no
knowledge of that; they are only guessing.
19146. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)
25. When Our clarifying Verses are recited to
them, their only argument is to say, “Bring
back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”
26. Say, “Allah gives you life, then He makes
you die; then He gathers you for the Day of
Resurrection, about which there is no doubt.
But most people do not know.”
27. To Allah belongs the kingship of the heav-
ens and the earth. On the Day when the Hour
takes place, on that Day the falsifiers will lose.
28. You will see every community on its knees;
every community will be called to its Book:
“Today you are being repaid for what you
used to do.
29. This Book of Ours speaks about you in
truth. We have been transcribing what you
have been doing.”
30. As for those who believed and did right-
eous deeds, their Lord will admit them into
His mercy. That is the clear triumph.
31. But as for those who disbelieved: “Were My
revelations not recited to you? But you
turned arrogant, and were guilty people.”
32. And when it was said, “The promise of Al-
lah is true, and of the Hour there is no doubt,”
you said, “We do not know what the Hour is;
we think it is only speculation; we are not
convinced.”
33. The evils of what they did will become evi-
dent to them, and the very thing they ridi-
culed will haunt them.
34. And it will be said, “Today We forget you,
as you forgot the encounter of this Day of
yours. Your abode is the Fire, and there are
no saviors for you.
35. That is because you took Allah’s revela-
tions for a joke, and the worldly life lured
you.” So today they will not be brought out of
it, and they will not be allowed to repent.
36. Praise belongs to Allah; Lord of the heav-
ens, Lord of the earth, Lord of humanity.
37. To Him belongs all supremacy in the heav-
ens and the earth. He is the Majestic, the
Wise.
46. THE DUNES
(al-Ahqaf)

1. Ha,
Meem.
The sending down of the Scripture is from
Allah, the Honorable, the Wise.
3. We did not create the heavens and the earth
and what lies between them except with rea-
son, and for a finite period. But the blas-
phemers continue to ignore the warnings
they receive.
4. Say, “Have you considered those you wor-
ship instead of Allah? Show me which por-
tion of the earth they have created. Or do they
own a share of the heavens? Bring me a scrip-
ture prior to this one, or some trace of
knowledge, if you are truthful.”
5. Who is more wrong than him who invokes,
besides Allah, those who will not answer him
until the Day of Resurrection, and are heed-
less of their prayers?
6. And when humanity is gathered, they will
be enemies to them, and will renounce their
worship of them.
7. When Our revelations are recited to them,
plain and clear, those who disbelieve say of
the truth when it has come to them, “This is
obviously magic.”
8. Or do they say, “He invented it himself”?
Say, “If I invented it myself, there is nothing
you can do to protect me from Allah. He
knows well what you are engaged in. He is
sufficient witness between me and you. He is
the Forgiver, the Merciful.”
9. Say, “I am not different from the other mes-
sengers; and I do not know what will be done
with me, or with you. I only follow what is in-
spired in me, and I am only a clear warner.”
10. Say, “Have you considered? What if it is
from Allah and you disbelieve in it? A witness
from the Children of Israel testified to its like,
2.
19246. THE DUNES (al-Ahqaf)
and has believed, while you turned arrogant.
Allah does not guide the unjust people.”
11. Those who disbelieve say to those who be-
lieve, “If it were anything good, they would
not have preceded us to it.” And since they
were not guided by it, they will say, “This is
an ancient lie.”
12. And before it was the Book of Moses, a
model and a mercy. And this is a confirming
Book, in the Arabic language, to warn those
who do wrong—and good news for the doers
of good.
13. Those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” then
lead a righteous life—they have nothing to
fear, nor shall they grieve.
14. These are the inhabitants of Paradise,
where they will dwell forever—a reward for
what they used to do.
15. We have enjoined upon man kindness to
his parents. His mother carried him with dif-
ficulty, and delivered him with difficulty. His
bearing and weaning takes thirty months.
Until, when he has attained his maturity, and
has reached forty years, he says, “Lord, enable
me to appreciate the blessings You have be-
stowed upon me and upon my parents, and
to act with righteousness, pleasing You. And
improve my children for me. I have sincerely
repented to You, and I am of those who have
surrendered.”
16. Those are they from whom We accept the
best of their deeds, and We overlook their
misdeeds, among the dwellers of Paradise—
the promise of truth which they are prom-
ised.
17. As for him who says to his parents,
“Enough of you! Are you promising me that
I will be raised up, when generations have
passed away before me?” While they cry for
Allah’s help, “Woe to you! Believe! The
promise of Allah is true!” But he says, “These
are nothing but tales of the ancients.”
18. Those are they upon whom the sentence is
justified, among the communities that have
passed away before them, of jinn and hu-
mans. They are truly losers.
19. There are degrees for everyone, according
to what they have done, and He will repay
them for their works in full, and they will not
be wronged.
20. On the Day when the faithless will be pa-
raded before the Fire: “You have squandered
your good in your worldly life, and you took
pleasure in them. So today you are being re-
paid with the torment of shame, because of
your unjust arrogance on earth, and because
you used to sin.”
21. And mention the brother of Aad, as he
warned his people at the dunes. Warnings
have passed away before him, and after him:
“Worship none but Allah; I fear for you the
punishment of a tremendous Day.”
22. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us
from our gods? Then bring us what you
threaten us with, if you are being truthful.”
23. He said, “The knowledge is only with Al-
lah, and I inform you of what I was sent with;
but I see you are an ignorant people.”
24. Then, when they saw a cloud approaching
their valley, they said, “This is a cloud that
will bring us rain.” “In fact, it is what you
were impatient for: a wind in which is griev-
ous suffering.”
25. It will destroy everything by the command
of its Lord. And when the morning came
upon them, there was nothing to be seen ex-
cept their dwellings. Thus We requite the
guilty people.
26. We had empowered them in the same way
as We empowered you; and We gave them
the hearing, and the sight, and the minds. But
neither their hearing, nor their sight, nor
their minds availed them in any way. That is
because they disregarded the revelations of
Allah; and so they became surrounded by
what they used to ridicule.
27. We have destroyed many townships
around you, and diversified the signs, so that
they may return.
28. Why then did the idols, whom they wor-
shiped as means of nearness to Allah, not
help them? In fact, they abandoned them. It
19347. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)
was their lie, a fabrication of their own mak-
ing.
29. Recall when We dispatched towards you a
number of jinn, to listen to the Quran. When
they came in its presence, they said, “Pay at-
tention!” Then, when it was concluded, they
rushed to their people, warning them.
30. They said, “O our people, we have heard a
Scripture, sent down after Moses, confirming
what came before it. It guides to the truth,
and to a straight path.
31. O our people! Answer the caller to Allah,
and believe in Him; and He will forgive you
your sins, and will save you from a painful
punishment.”
32. He who does not answer the caller to Allah
will not escape on earth, and has no protec-
tors besides Him. Those are in obvious error.
33. Do they not realize that Allah, who created
the heavens and the earth, and was never
tired by creating them, is Able to revive the
dead? Yes indeed; He is Capable of every-
thing.
34. On the Day when those who disbelieved
are presented to the Fire: “Is this not real?”
They will say, “Yes, indeed, by our Lord.” He
will say, “Then taste the suffering for having
disbelieved.”
35. So be patient, as the messengers with re-
solve were patient, and do not be hasty re-
garding them. On the Day when they witness
what they are promised, it will seem as if they
had lasted only for an hour of a day. A proc-
lamation: Will any be destroyed except the
sinful people?
47. MUHAMMAD
(Muhammad)

Those who disbelieve and repel from the
path of Allah—He nullifies their works.
2. While those who believe, and work right-
eousness, and believe in what was sent down
1.
to Muhammad—and it is the truth from their
Lord—He remits their sins, and relieves their
concerns.
3. That is because those who disbelieve follow
falsehoods, while those who believe follow
the truth from their Lord. Allah thus cites for
the people their examples.
4. When you encounter those who disbelieve,
strike at their necks. Then, when you have
routed them, bind them firmly. Then, either
release them by grace, or by ransom, until
war lays down its burdens. Had Allah willed,
He could have defeated them Himself, but He
thus tests some of you by means of others. As
for those who are killed in the way of Allah,
He will not let their deeds go to waste.
5. He will guide them, and will improve their
state of mind.
6. And will admit them into Paradise, which
He has identified for them.
7. O you who believe! If you support Allah, He
will support you, and will strengthen your
foothold.
8. But as for those who disbelieve, for them is
perdition, and He will waste their deeds.
9. That is because they hated what Allah re-
vealed, so He nullified their deeds.
10. Have they not journeyed through the earth
and seen the consequences for those before
them? Allah poured destruction upon them,
and for the unbelievers is something compa-
rable.
11. That is because Allah is the Master of those
who believe, while the disbelievers have no
master.
12. Allah will admit those who believe and do
good deeds into gardens beneath which riv-
ers flow. As for those who disbelieve, they en-
joy themselves, and eat as cattle eat, and the
Fire will be their dwelling.
13. How many a town was more powerful than
your town which evicted you? We destroyed
them, and there was no helper for them.
14. Is he who stands upon evidence from his
Lord, like someone whose evil deed is made
19447. MUHAMMAD (Muhammad)
to appear good to him? And they follow their
own desires?
15. The likeness of the Garden promised to the
righteous: in it are rivers of pure water, and
rivers of milk forever fresh, and rivers of wine
delightful to the drinkers, and rivers of
strained honey. And therein they will have of
every fruit, and forgiveness from their Lord.
Like one abiding in the Fire forever, and are
given to drink boiling water, that cuts-up
their bowels?
16. Among them are those who listen to you,
but when they leave your presence, they say
to those given knowledge, “What did he say
just now?” Those are they whose hearts Allah
has sealed, and they follow their own desires.
17. As for those who are guided, He increases
them in guidance, and He has granted them
their righteousness.
18. Are they just waiting until the Hour comes
to them suddenly? Its tokens have already
come. But how will they be reminded when it
has come to them?
19. Know that there is no god but Allah, and
ask forgiveness for your sin, and for the be-
lieving men and believing women. Allah
knows your movements, and your resting-
place.
20. Those who believe say, “If only a chapter is
sent down.” Yet when a decisive chapter is
sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it,
you see those in whose hearts is sickness
looking at you with the look of someone
fainting at death. So woe to them!
21. Obedience and upright speech. Then,
when the matter is settled, being true to Allah
would have been better for them.
22. If you turn away, you are likely to make
mischief on earth, and sever your family ties.
23. Those are they whom Allah has cursed. He
made them deaf, and blinded their sight.
24. Will they not ponder the Quran? Or are
there locks upon their hearts?
25. Those who reverted after the guidance be-
came clear to them—Satan has enticed them,
and has given them latitude.
26. That is because they said to those who
hated what Allah has revealed, “We will obey
you in certain matters.” But Allah knows
their secret thoughts.
27. How about when the angels take them at
death, beating their faces and their backs?
28. That is because they pursued what dis-
pleases Allah, and they disliked His approval,
so He nullified their works.
29. Do those in whose hearts is sickness think
that Allah will not expose their malice?
30. Had We willed, We could have shown
them to you, and you would have recognized
them by their marks. Yet you will recognize
them by their tone of speech. And Allah
knows your actions.
31. We will certainly test you, until We know
those among you who strive, and those who
are steadfast, and We will test your reactions.
32. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from the
path of Allah, and oppose the Messenger af-
ter guidance has become clear to them—they
will not hurt Allah in the least, but He will
nullify their deeds.
33. O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey
the Messenger, and do not let your deeds go
to waste.
34. Those who disbelieve, and hinder from Al-
lah’s path, and then die as disbelievers—Al-
lah will not forgive them.
35. So do not waver and call for peace while
you have the upper hand. Allah is with you,
and He will not waste your efforts.
36. The life of this world is nothing but play
and pastime. But if you have faith and lead a
righteous life, He will grant you your re-
wards, and He will not ask you for your pos-
sessions.
37. Were He to ask you for it, and press you,
you would become tightfisted, and He would
expose your unwillingness.
19548. VICTORY (al-Fath)
38. Here you are, being called to spend in the
cause of Allah. Among you are those who
withhold; but whoever withholds is with-
holding against his own soul. Allah is the
Rich, while you are the needy. And if you
turn away, He will replace you with another
people, and they will not be like you.
48. VICTORY
(al-Fath)

1. We have granted you a conspicuous victory.
2. That Allah may forgive you your sin, past
and to come, and complete His favors upon
you, and guide you in a straight path.
3. And
help you with an unwavering support.
is He who sent down tranquility into the
hearts of the believers, to add faith to their
faith. To Allah belong the forces of the heav-
ens and the earth. Allah is Knowing and
Wise.
5. He will admit the believers, male and fe-
male, into Gardens beneath which rivers
flow, to abide therein forever, and He will re-
mit their sins. That, with Allah, is a great tri-
umph.
6. And He will punish the hypocrites, male
and female, and the idolaters, male and fe-
male, those who harbor evil thoughts about
Allah. They are surrounded by evil; and Allah
is angry with them, and has cursed them, and
has prepared for them Hell—a miserable des-
tination.
7. To Allah belong the troops of the heavens
and the earth. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
8. We sent you as a witness, and a bearer of
good news, and a warner.
9. That you may believe in Allah and His Mes-
senger, and support Him, and honor Him,
and praise Him morning and evening.
10. Those who pledge allegiance to you are
pledging allegiance to Allah. The hand of Al-
lah is over their hands. Whoever breaks his
4. It
pledge breaks it to his own loss. And whoever
fulfills his covenant with Allah, He will grant
him a great reward.
11. The Desert-Arabs who remained behind
will say to you, “Our belongings and our fam-
ilies have preoccupied us, so ask forgiveness
for us.” They say with their tongues what is
not in their hearts. Say, “Who can avail you
anything against Allah, if He desires loss for
you, or desires gain for you?” In fact, Allah is
Informed of what you do.
12. But you thought that the Messenger and
the believers will never return to their fami-
lies, and this seemed fine to your hearts; and
you harbored evil thoughts, and were uncivi-
lized people.
13. He who does not believe in Allah and His
Messenger—We have prepared for the disbe-
lievers a Blazing Fire.
14. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heav-
ens and the earth. He forgives whomever He
wills, and He punishes whomever He wills.
Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
15. Those who lagged behind will say when
you depart to collect the gains, “Let us follow
you.” They want to change the Word of Al-
lah. Say, “You will not follow us; Allah has
said so before.” Then they will say, “But you
are jealous of us.” In fact, they understand
only a little.
16. Say to the Desert-Arabs who lagged be-
hind, “You will be called against a people of
great might; you will fight them, unless they
submit. If you obey, Allah will give you a fine
reward. But if you turn away, as you turned
away before, He will punish you with a pain-
ful punishment.”
17. There is no blame on the blind, nor any
blame on the lame, nor any blame on the sick.
Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger—
He will admit him into gardens beneath
which rivers flow; but whoever turns away—
He will punish him with a painful punish-
ment.
18. Allah was pleased with the believers, when
they pledged allegiance to you under the tree.
19649. THE CHAMBERS (al-Hujurat)
He knew what was in their hearts, and sent
down serenity upon them, and rewarded
them with an imminent conquest.
19. And abundant gains for them to capture.
Allah is Mighty and Wise.
20. Allah has promised you abundant gains,
which you will capture. He has expedited this
for you, and has restrained people’s hands
from you; that it may be a sign to the believ-
ers, and that He may guide you on a straight
path.
21. And other things, of which you were inca-
pable, but Allah has encompassed them. Al-
lah is Capable of everything.
22. If those who disbelieve had fought you,
they would have turned back and fled, then
found neither protector nor helper.
23. It is Allah’s pattern, ongoing since the past.
You will never find any change in Allah’s pat-
tern.
24. It is He who withheld their hands from
you, and your hands from them, in the valley
of Mecca, after giving you advantage over
them. Allah is Observer of what you do.
25. It is they who disbelieved, and barred you
from the Sacred Mosque, and prevented the
offering from reaching its destination. Were
it not for faithful men and faithful women,
whom you did not know, you were about to
hurt them, and became guilty of an uninten-
tional crime. Thus Allah admits into His
mercy whomever He wills. Had they dis-
persed, We would have punished those who
disbelieved among them with a painful pen-
alty.
26. Those who disbelieved filled their hearts
with rage—the rage of the days of ignorance.
But Allah sent His serenity down upon His
Messenger, and upon the believers, and im-
posed on them the words of righteousness—
of which they were most worthy and deserv-
ing. Allah is aware of everything.
27. Allah has fulfilled His Messenger’s vision
in truth: “You will enter the Sacred Mosque,
Allah willing, in security, heads shaven, or
hair cut short, not fearing. He knew what you
did not know, and has granted besides that an
imminent victory.”
28. It is He who sent His Messenger with the
guidance and the religion of truth, to make it
prevail over all religions. Allah suffices as
Witness.
29. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
Those with him are stern against the disbe-
lievers, yet compassionate amongst them-
selves. You see them kneeling, prostrating,
seeking blessings from Allah and approval.
Their marks are on their faces from the ef-
fects of prostration. Such is their description
in the Torah, and their description in the
Gospel: like a plant that sprouts, becomes
strong, grows thick, and rests on its stem, im-
pressing the farmers. Through them He en-
rages the disbelievers. Allah has promised
those among them who believe and do good
deeds forgiveness and a great reward.
49. THE CHAMBERS
(al-Hujurat)

1. O
you who believe! Do not place your opin-
ions above that of Allah and His Messenger,
and fear Allah. Allah is Hearing and Know-
ing.
2. O you who believe! Do not raise your voices
above the voice of the Prophet, and do not
speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to
one another, lest your works be in vain with-
out you realizing.
3. Those who lower their voices before Allah’s
Messenger—those are they whose hearts Al-
lah has tested for piety. They will have for-
giveness and a great reward.
4. Those who call you from behind the cham-
bers—most of them do not understand.
5. Had they remained patient until you came
out to them, it would have been better for
them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19750. QAF (Qaf)
6. O you who believe! If a troublemaker
brings
you any news, investigate, lest you harm peo-
ple out of ignorance, and you become regret-
ful for what you have done.
7. And know that among you is the Messenger
of Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things,
you would have suffered hardship. But Allah
has given you the love of faith, and adorned
it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mis-
chief, and rebellion hateful to you. These are
the rightly guided.
8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is
Knowing and Wise.
9. If two groups of believers fight each other,
reconcile between them. But if one group ag-
gresses against the other, fight the aggressing
group until it complies with Allah’s com-
mand. Once it has complied, reconcile be-
tween them with justice, and be equitable. Al-
lah loves the equitable.
10. The believers are brothers, so reconcile be-
tween your brothers, and remain conscious
of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.
11. O you who believe! No people shall ridicule
other people, for they may be better than
they. Nor shall any women ridicule other
women, for they may be better than they. Nor
shall you slander one another, nor shall you
insult one another with names. Evil is the re-
turn to wickedness after having attained
faith. Whoever does not repent—these are
the wrongdoers.
12. O you who believe! Avoid most suspi-
cion—some suspicion is sinful. And do not
spy on one another, nor backbite one an-
other. Would any of you like to eat the flesh
of his dead brother? You would detest it. So
remain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re-
lenting, Most Merciful.
13. O people! We created you from a male and
a female, and made you races and tribes, that
you may know one another. The best among
you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous.
Allah is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced.
14. The Desert-Arabs say, “We have believed.”
Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We
have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered
into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and
His Messenger, He will not diminish any of
your deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”
15. The believers are those who believe in Al-
lah and His Messenger, and then have not
doubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with
their wealth and their persons. These are the
sincere.
16. Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about
your religion, when Allah knows everything
in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is
aware of all things?”
17. They regarded it a favor to you that they
have submitted. Say, “Do not consider your
submission a favor to me; it is Allah who has
done you a favor by guiding you to the faith,
if you are sincere.”
18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and
the earth, and Allah is seeing of everything
you do.
50. QAF
(Qaf)

1. Qaf.
By the Glorious Quran.
They marveled that a warner has come to
them from among them. The disbelievers say,
“This is something strange.
3. When we have died and become dust? This
is a farfetched return.”
4. We know what the earth consumes of them,
and with Us is a comprehensive book.
5. But they denied the truth when it has come
to them, so they are in a confused state.
6. Have they not observed the sky above them,
how We constructed it, and decorated it, and

7. And the earth, how We spread it out, and
set on it mountains, and grew in it all kinds
of delightful pairs?

19850. QAF (Qaf)
8. A
lesson and a reminder for every penitent
worshiper.
9. And We brought down from the sky blessed
water, and produced with it gardens and
grain to harvest.
10. And the soaring palm trees, with clustered
dates.
11. As sustenance for the servants. And We re-
vive thereby a dead town. Likewise is the res-
urrection.
12. Before them the people of Noah denied the
truth, and so did the dwellers of Russ, and
Thamood.
13. And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of
Lot.
14. And the Dwellers of the Woods, and the
people of Tubba. They all rejected the mes-
sengers, so My threat came true.
15. Were We fatigued by the first creation? But
they are in doubt of a new creation.
16. We created the human being, and We
know what his soul whispers to him. We are
nearer to him than his jugular vein.
17. As the two receivers receive, seated to the
right and to the left.
18. Not a word does he utter, but there is a
watcher by him, ready.
19. The daze of death has come in truth: “This
is what you tried to evade.”
20. And the Trumpet is blown: “This is the
Promised Day.”
21. And every soul will come forward, accom-
panied by a driver and a witness.
22. “You were in neglect of this, so We lifted
your screen from you, and your vision today
is keen.”
23. And His escort will say, “This is what I have
ready with me.”
24. “Throw into Hell every stubborn disbe-
liever.
25. Preventer
of good, aggressor, doubter.
Who fabricated another god with Allah;
toss him into the intense agony.”
His escort will say, “Our Lord, I did not
make him rebel, but he was far astray.”
28. He will say, “Do not feud in My presence—
I had warned you in advance.
29. The decree from Me will not be changed,
and I am not unjust to the servants.”
30. On the Day when We will say to Hell, “Are
you full?” And it will say, “Are there any
more?”
31. And Paradise will be brought closer to the
pious, not far away.
32. “This is what you were promised—for
every careful penitent.
33. Who inwardly feared the Most Gracious,
and came with a repentant heart.
34. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eter-
nity.”
35. Therein they will have whatever they de-
sire—and We have even more.
36. How many generations before them, who
were more powerful than they, did We de-
stroy? They explored the lands—was there
any escape?
37. In that is a reminder for whoever possesses
a heart, or cares to listen and witness.
38. We created the heavens and the earth and
what is between them in six days, and no fa-
tigue touched Us.
39. So endure what they say, and proclaim the
praises of your Lord before the rising of the
sun, and before sunset.
40. And glorify Him during the night, and at
the end of devotions.
41. And listen for the Day when the caller calls
from a nearby place.
42. The Day when they will hear the Shout in
all truth. That is the Day of Emergence.
43. It is We who control life and death, and to
Us is the destination.
44. The Day when the earth will crack for them
at once. That is an easy gathering for Us.
27.

25. When they entered upon him, they said,
“Peace.” He said, “Peace, strangers.”
26. Then he slipped away to his family, and
brought a fatted calf.
27. He set it before them. He said, “Will you
not eat?”
28. And he harbored fear of them. They said,
“Do not fear,” and they announced to him the
good news of a knowledgeable boy.
29. His wife came forward crying. She clasped
her face, and said, “A barren old woman?”
30. They said, “Thus spoke your Lord. He is
the Wise, the Knowing.”
31. He said, “What is your business, O en-

37. And We left in it a sign for those who fear
the painful punishment.
38. And in Moses. We sent him to Pharaoh
with a clear authority.
39. But he turned away with his warlords, and
said, “A sorcerer or a madman.”
40. So We seized him and his troops, and
threw them into the sea, and He was to
blame.
41. And in Aad. We unleashed against them
the devastating wind.
42. It spared nothing it came upon, but ren-
dered it like decayed ruins.
43. And in Thamood. They were told, “Enjoy
yourselves for a while.”
20052. THE MOUNT (at-Tur)
44. But they defied the command of their Lord,
so the lightning struck them as they looked
on.
45. They could not rise up, nor could they find
help.
46. And before that, the people of Noah. They
were immoral people.
47. We constructed the universe with power,
and We are expanding it.
48. And the earth—We spread it out—How
well We prepared it!
49. We created all things in pairs, so that you
may reflect and ponder.
50. “So flee towards Allah. I am to you from
Him a clear warner.”
51. “And do not set up any other god with Al-
lah. I am to you from Him a clear warner.”
52. Likewise, no messenger came to those be-
fore them, but they said, “A sorcerer or a
madman.”
53. Did they recommend it to one another? In
fact, they are rebellious people.
54. So turn away from them; you are not to
blame.
55. And remind, for the reminder benefits the
believers.
56. I did not create the jinn and the humans
except to worship Me.
57. I need no livelihood from them, nor do I
need them to feed Me.
58. Allah is the Provider, the One with Power,
the Strong.
59. Those who do wrong will have their turn,
like the turn of their counterparts, so let them
not rush Me.
60. So woe to those who disbelieve because of
that Day of theirs which they are promised.

17. But the righteous will be amid gardens and
bliss.
18. Enjoying what their Lord has given them,
and their Lord has spared them the suffering
of Hell.
19. Eat and drink happily, for what you used to
do.
20. Relaxing on luxurious furnishings; and We
will couple them with gorgeous spouses.
21. Those who believed, and their offspring
followed them in faith—We will unite them
with their offspring, and We will not deprive
them of any of their works. Every person is
hostage to what he has earned.
22. And We will supply them with fruit, and
meat; such as they desire.
23. They will exchange therein a cup; wherein
is neither harm, nor sin.
24. Serving them will be youths like hidden
pearls.

And they will approach one another, in-
quiring.
26. They will say, “Before this, we were fearful
for our families.
27. But Allah blessed us, and spared us the ag-
ony of the Fiery Winds.
28. Before this, we used to pray to Him. He is
the Good, the Compassionate.”
29. So remind. By the grace of your Lord, you
are neither a soothsayer, nor a madman.
30. Or do they say, “A poet—we await for him
a calamity of time”?
31. Say, “Go on waiting; I will be waiting with
you.”
32. Or is it that their dreams compel them to
this? Or are they aggressive people?
33. Or do they say, “He made it up”? Rather,
they do not believe.
34. So let them produce a discourse like it, if
they are truthful.
35. Or were they created out of nothing? Or
are they the creators?
36. Or did they create the heavens and the
earth? In fact, they are not certain.
37. Or do they possess the treasuries of your
Lord? Or are they the controllers?
38. Or do they have a stairway by means of
which they listen? Then let their listener pro-
duce a clear proof.
39. Or for Him the daughters, and for you the
sons?
40. Or do you demand a payment from them,
and they are burdened by debt?
41. Or do they know the future, and they are
writing it down?
42. Or are they planning a conspiracy? The
conspiracy will befall the disbelievers.
43. Or do they have a god besides Allah? Allah
transcends what they associate.
44. Even if they were to see lumps of the sky
falling down, they would say, “A mass of
clouds.”
25.
45. So
leave them until they meet their Day in
which they will be stunned.
46. The Day when their ploys will avail them
nothing; and they will not be helped.
47. For those who do wrong, there is a punish-
ment besides that; but most of them do not
know.
48. So patiently await the decision of your
Lord, for you are before Our Eyes; and pro-
claim the praises of your Lord when you
arise.
49. And glorify Him during the night, and at
the receding of the stars.

These are nothing but names, which you
have devised, you and your ancestors, for
which Allah sent down no authority. They
follow nothing but assumptions, and what
the ego desires, even though guidance has
come to them from their Lord.

many an angel is there in the heavens
whose intercession avails nothing, except af-
ter Allah gives permission to whomever He
wills, and approves?
27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
give the angels the names of females.
28. They have no knowledge of that. They only
follow assumptions, and assumptions are no
substitute for the truth.
29. So avoid him who has turned away from
Our remembrance, and desires nothing but
the present life.
30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your
Lord knows best who has strayed from His
path, and He knows best who has accepted
guidance.
31. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heav-
ens and whatever is on earth. He will repay
those who do evil according to their deeds,
and recompense those who do good with the
best.
32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen-
cies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is
of Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever
since He created you from the earth, and ever
since you were embryos in your mothers’
wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue;
He is fully aware of the righteous.
26. How
Have you considered him who turned

54. THE MOON
(al-Qamar)

1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon
has split.
2. Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn
away, and say, “Continuous magic.”
3. They lied, and followed their opinions, but
everything has its time.
4. And there came to them news containing a
deterrent.
5. Profound wisdom—but warnings are of no
avail.
6. So turn away from them. On the Day when
the Caller calls to something terrible.
7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge
from the graves, as if they were swarming lo-
custs.
8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe-
lievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”
9. Before them the people of Noah disbelieved.
They rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,”
and he was rebuked.
10. So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over-
whelmed, so help me.”
11. So We opened the floodgates of heaven
with water pouring down.
12. And We made the earth burst with springs,
and the waters met for a purpose already des-
tined.
13. And We carried him on a craft of planks
and nails.
14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him
who was rejected.
23. Thamood
rejected the warnings.
They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a
human being? We would then go astray, and
end up in Hell.
25. Was the message given to him, out of all of
us? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”
26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked
liar is.
27. We are sending the she-camel as a test for
them; so watch them and be patient.
28. And inform them that the water is to be
shared between them; each share of drink
made available.
29. But they called their friend, and he dared,
and he slaughtered.
30. So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
31. We sent against them a single Scream, and
they became like crushed hay.
32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is
there anyone who would understand?
24.
33. The
people of Lot rejected the warnings.
We unleashed upon them a shower of
stones, except for the family of Lot; We res-
cued them at dawn.

41. The warnings also came to the people of
Pharaoh.
42. They rejected Our signs, all of them, so We
seized them—the seizure of an Almighty
Omnipotent.
43. Are your unbelievers better than all those?
Or do you have immunity in the scriptures?
44. Or do they say, “We are united, and we will
be victorious”?
45. The multitude will be defeated, and they
will turn their backs.
