43. Do not approach the prayer:
- while you are drunk, so that you know what you say
- after sexual orgasm—unless you are travelling—until you have bathed. 

If you are sick, or traveling, or one of you comes from the toilet, or you have had
intercourse with women, and cannot find water, find clean sand and wipe your faces and your hands with it.


44. Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They buy error,
and wish you would lose the way.

45. But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi-
cient as a Supporter.

46. Among the Jews are some who take words out of context, and say, “We hear and we dis-
obey”, and “Hear without listening”, and “Observe us,” twisting with their tongues and
slandering the religion. Had they said, “We
hear and we obey”, and “Listen”, and “Give
us your attention,” it would have been better
for them, and more upright. But Allah has
cursed them for their disbelief; they do not
believe except a little.
47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in
what We sent down, confirming what you
have, before We obliterate faces and turn
them inside out, or curse them as We cursed
the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah
is always done.

48. Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives anything less than that
to whomever He wills. Whoever associates anything with Allah has devised a monstrous
sin.

49. Have you not considered those who claim purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies
whom He wills, and they will not be wronged a whit.

50. See how they devise lies against Allah. That alone is an outright sin.

51. Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They believe in superstition and evil powers, and say of those who disbelieve, “These are better guided on the way than the believers.”

52. Those are they whom Allah has cursed.
Whomever Allah curses, you will find no sav-
ior for him.
53. Or do they own a share of the kingdom?
Then they would not give people a speck.
54. Or do they envy the people for what Allah
has given them of His grace? We have given
the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom,
and We have given them a great kingdom.
55. Among them are those who believed in it,
and among them are those who held back
from it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno.
56. Those who reject Our revelations—We will
scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins
are cooked, We will replace them with other
skins, so they will experience the suffering.
Allah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.
57. As for those who believe and do good
deeds, We will admit them into Gardens be-
neath which rivers flow, abiding therein for-
ever. They will have purified spouses therein,
and We will admit them into a shady shade.
58. Allah instructs you to give back things en-
trusted to you to their owners. And when you
judge between people, judge with justice. Al-
lah’s instructions to you are excellent. Allah
is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
59. O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey
the Messenger and those in authority among
you. And if you dispute over anything, refer
it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe
in Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a
most excellent determination.
60. Have you not observed those who claim
that they believe in what was revealed to you,
and in what was revealed before you, yet they
seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of
being commanded to reject them? Satan
means to mislead them far away.
61. And when it is said to them, “Come to what
Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,”
you see the hypocrites shunning you completely.

62. How about when a disaster strikes them
because what their hands have put forward,
and then they come to you swearing by Allah:
“We only intended goodwill and reconcilia-
tion”?
63. They are those whom Allah knows what is
in their hearts. So ignore them, and admon-
ish them, and say to them concerning them-
selves penetrating words.
64. We did not send any messenger except to
be obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when
they wronged themselves, come to you, and
prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes-
senger had prayed for their forgiveness, they
would have found Allah Relenting and Merciful.

65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe
until they call you to arbitrate in their dis-
putes, and then find within themselves no re-
sentment regarding your decisions, and sub-
mit themselves completely.
66. Had We decreed for them: “Kill your-
selves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would
not have done it, except for a few of them. But
had they done what they were instructed to
do, it would have been better for them, and a
firmer confirmation.
67. And We would have given them from Our
presence a rich compensation.
68. And We would have guided them on a
straight path.
69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger—
these are with those whom Allah has
blessed—among the prophets, and the sin-
cere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel-
lent are those as companions.
70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices
as Knower.
71. O you who believe! Take your precautions,
and mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto-
gether.
72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then,
when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah
has favored me, that I was not martyred with
them.”
73. But when some bounty from Allah comes
to you, he says—as if no affection existed be-
tween you and him—“If only I had been with
them, I would have achieved a great victory.”
74. Let those who sell the life of this world for
the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah.
Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and
then is killed, or achieves victory, We will
grant him a great compensation.
75. And why would you not fight in the cause
of Allah, and the helpless men, and women,
and children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us
from this town whose people are oppressive,
and appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro-
tector, and appoint for us from Your Pres-
ence a Victor.”
76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al-
lah, while those who disbelieve fight in the
cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil.
Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.
77. Have you not considered those who were
told, “Restrain your hands, and perform your
prayers, and spend in regular charity”? But
when fighting was ordained for them, a fac-
tion of them feared the people as Allah is
ought to be feared, or even more. And they
said, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting
for us? If only You would postpone it for us
for a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of
this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better
for the righteous, and you will not be
wronged one bit.”
78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up
with you, even if you were in fortified towers.
When a good fortune comes their way, they
say, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor-
tune befalls them, they say, “This is from
you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the
matter with these people, that they hardly un-
derstand a thing?
79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al-
lah, and whatever bad happens to you is from
your own self. We sent you to humanity as a
messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.
80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying
Allah. And whoever turns away—We did not
send you as a watcher over them.


you may find them; and do not take from
among them allies or supporters.

90. Except those who join people with whom you have a treaty, or those who come to you
reluctant to fight you or fight their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given
them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they withdraw from you, and
do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah assigns no excuse for you against them.
91. You will find others who want security from you, and security from their own people. But whenever they are tempted into civil discord, they plunge into it. So if they do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor
restrain their hands, seize them and execute
them wherever you find them. Against these,
We have given you clear authorization.
92. Never should a believer kill another be-
liever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be-
liever by error must set free a believing slave,
and pay compensation to the victim’s family,
unless they remit it as charity. If the victim
belonged to a people who are hostile to you,
but is a believer, then the compensation is to
free a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo-
ple with whom you have a treaty, then com-
pensation should be handed over to his fam-
ily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who
lacks the means must fast for two consecutive
months, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah
is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the
penalty for him is Hell, where he will remain
forever. And Allah will be angry with him,
and will curse him, and will prepare for him
a terrible punishment.
94. O you who believe! When you journey in
the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say
to him who offers you peace, “You are not a
believer,” aspiring for the goods of this world.
With Allah are abundant riches. You your-
selves were like this before, and Allah be-
stowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is
well aware of what you do.
They profess obedience, but when they
leave your presence, some of them conspire
something contrary to what you said. But Al-
lah writes down what they conspire. So avoid
them, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is
Guardian enough.

82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it
been from any other than Allah, they would
have found in it much discrepancy.
83. When some news of security or alarm
comes their way, they broadcast it. But had
they referred it to the Messenger, and to those
in authority among them, those who can
draw conclusions from it would have com-
prehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing
and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.

84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re-
sponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be-
lievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might
of those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in
Might, and More Punishing.
85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a
share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil
cause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch
over everything.
86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re-
spond with a better greeting, or return it. Al-
lah keeps count of everything.
87. Allah—there is no god except He. He will
gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in
which there is no doubt. And who speaks
more truly than Allah?
88. What is the matter with you, divided into
two factions regarding the hypocrites, when
Allah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac-
count of what they did? Do you want to guide
those whom Allah has led astray? Whomever
Allah leads astray—you will never find for
him a way.
89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just
as they disbelieve, so you would become
equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless
they emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn
away, seize them and execute them wherever
81.




or are sick, by putting down your weapons; but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a demeaning punishment.

96. 

Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

97. While the angels are removing the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they
will say, “What was the matter with you?”

They will say, “We were oppressed in the
land.” They will say, “Was Allah’s earth not
vast enough for you to emigrate in it?”
These—their refuge is Hell. What a wretched
retreat!

98. Except for the weak among men, and
women, and children who have no means to
act, and no means to find a way out.
99. These—Allah may well pardon them. Allah
is Pardoning and Forgiving.
100. Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Al-
lah will find on earth many places of refuge,
and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home,
emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and
then is overtaken by death, his compensation
falls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merci-
ful.
101. When you travel in the land, there is no
blame on you for shortening the prayers, if
you fear that the disbelievers may harm you.
The disbelievers are your manifest enemies.
102. When you are among them, and you stand
to lead them in prayer, let a group of them
stand with you, and let them hold their weap-
ons. Then, when they have done their pros-
trations, let them withdraw to the rear, and
let another group, that have not prayed yet,
come forward and pray with you; and let
them take their precautions and their weap-
ons. Those who disbelieve would like you to
neglect your weapons and your equipment,
so they can attack you in a single assault. You
commit no error, if you are hampered by rain

103. When you have completed the prayer, re-
member Allah, standing, or sitting, or on
your sides. And when you feel secure, per-
form the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for
believers at specific times.
104. And do not falter in the pursuit of the en-
emy. If you are aching, they are aching as you
are aching, but you expect from Allah what
they cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable
and Wise.
105. We have revealed to you the Scripture,
with the truth, so that you judge between
people in accordance with what Allah has
shown you. And do not be an advocate for the
traitors.
106. And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is
Forgiver and Merciful.
107. And do not argue on behalf of those who
deceive themselves. Allah does not love the
deceitful sinner.
108. They hide from the people, but they can-
not hide from Allah. He is with them, as they
plot by night with words He does not ap-
prove. Allah comprehends what they do.
109. There you are, arguing on their behalf in
the present life, but who will argue with Allah
on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection?
Or who will be their representative?
110. Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul,
then implores Allah for forgiveness, will find
Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
111. And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against
himself. Allah is Aware and Wise.
112. And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin,
and then blames it on an innocent person,
has taken a slander and a clear sin.
113. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you,
and His mercy, a faction of them would have
managed to mislead you. But they only mislead themselves, and they cannot harm you in
Not equal are the inactive among the believers—except the disabled—and the strivers in the cause of Allah with their possessions and their persons. Allah prefers the
strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. But Allah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah
favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward.



any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Allah’s goodness towards you is great.

114. There is no good in much of their private
counsels, except for him who advocates char-
ity, or kindness, or reconciliation between
people. Whoever does that, seeking Allah’s
approval, We will give him a great compen-
sation.
115. Whoever makes a breach with the Messen-
ger, after the guidance has become clear to
him, and follows other than the path of the
believers, We will direct him in the direction
he has chosen, and commit him to Hell—
what a terrible destination!
116. Allah will not forgive that partners be as-
sociated with Him; but will forgive anything
less than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone
who ascribes partners to Allah has strayed
into far error.
117. They invoke in His stead only females. In
fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.
118. Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will
take to myself my due share of Your serv-
ants.”
119. “And I will mislead them, and I will entice
them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears
of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the
creation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a
lord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a
profound loss.
120. He promises them, and he raises their ex-
pectations, but Satan promises them nothing
but delusions.
121. These—their place is Hell, and they will
find no escape from it.
122. But as for those who believe and do right-
eous deeds, We will admit them into gardens
beneath which rivers flow, where they will
abide forever. The promise of Allah is true—
and who is more truthful in speech than Allah?

It is not in accordance with your wishes,
nor in accordance with the wishes of the Peo-
ple of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will
pay for it, and will not find for himself, be-
sides Allah, any protector or savior.

124. But whoever works righteousness,
whether male or female, and is a believer—
those will enter Paradise, and will not be
wronged a whit.
125. And who is better in religion than he who
submits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer
of good, and follows the faith of Abraham the
Monotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a
friend.
126. To Allah belongs what is in the heavens
and what is on earth, and Allah encompasses
everything.
127. They ask you for a ruling about women.
Say, “Allah gives you a ruling about them,
and so does what is stated to you in the Book
about widowed women from whom you
withhold what is decreed for them, yet you
desire to marry them, and about helpless chil-
dren: that you should treat the orphans
fairly.” Whatever good you do, Allah knows
it.
128. If a woman fears maltreatment or deser-
tion from her husband, there is no fault in
them if they reconcile their differences, for
reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to ava-
rice; yet if you do what is good, and practice
piety—Allah is Cognizant of what you do.
129. You will not be able to treat women with
equal fairness, no matter how much you de-
sire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an-
other suspended. If you make amends, and
act righteously—Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.
130. And if they separate, Allah will enrich each from His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and Wise.
131. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. We have in-
structed those who were given the Book before you, and you, to be conscious of Allah.

they say, “Did we not side with you, and de-
fend you from the believers?” Allah will judge
between you on the Day of Resurrection; and
Allah will give the disbelievers no means of
overcoming the believers.

<!-- 
132. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as
Manager.

133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring others. Allah is Able to do that.

134. Whoever desires the reward of this world—with Allah is the reward of this world
and the next. Allah is All-Hearing, All-See-
ing.
