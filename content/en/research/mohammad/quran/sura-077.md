77. THE UNLEASHED
(al-Mursalat)

1. [The Day of Judgement will be] unleashed in succession. It will:
- storm turbulently
- scatter far and wide
- separate decisively
- delivering a message, either excusing or warning

On that day:
- the stars will be obliterated
- the sky is fractured
- the mountains are blown away
- the messengers are alerted

It will be deferred until the Day of Decision.

And what will teach you what the Day of
Decision is?
