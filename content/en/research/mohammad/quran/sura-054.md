{{< s v="1" >}}  The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split.

{{< s v="2" >}}  Yet whenever they see a miracle, they turn away, and say, “Continuous magic.”{{< s v="3" >}}  They lied, and followed their opinions, but everything has its time.

{{< s v="4" >}}  And there came to them news containing a deterrent.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Profound wisdom—but warnings are of no avail.

6. So turn away from them. On the Day when the Caller calls to something terrible.

7. Their eyes humiliated, they will emerge from the graves, as if they were swarming locusts.

8. Scrambling towards the Caller, the disbe-
lievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”{{< s v="9" >}}  Before them the people of Noah disbelieved.
They rejected Our servant, and said, “Crazy,”
and he was rebuked.{{< s v="10" >}}  So he appealed to his Lord, “I am over-
whelmed, so help me.”{{< s v="11" >}}  So We opened the floodgates of heaven
with water pouring down.
12. And We made the earth burst with springs,
and the waters met for a purpose already des-
tined.
13. And We carried him on a craft of planks
and nails.
14. Sailing before Our eyes; a reward for him
who was rejected.
23. Thamood
rejected the warnings.
They said, “Are we to follow one of us, a
human being? We would then go astray, and
end up in Hell.
25. Was the message given to him, out of all of
us? In fact, he is a wicked liar.”
26. They will know tomorrow who the wicked
liar is.
27. We are sending the she-camel as a test for
them; so watch them and be patient.
28. And inform them that the water is to be
shared between them; each share of drink
made available.
29. But they called their friend, and he dared,
and he slaughtered.
30. So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
31. We sent against them a single Scream, and
they became like crushed hay.
32. We made the Quran easy to understand. Is
there anyone who would understand?
24.
33. The
people of Lot rejected the warnings.
We unleashed upon them a shower of
stones, except for the family of Lot; We res-
cued them at dawn.
34.
20455. THE COMPASSIONATE (ar-Rahman)
A blessing from Us. Thus We reward the
thankful.
36. He had warned them of Our onslaught, but
they dismissed the warnings.
37. They even lusted for his guest, so We oblit-
erated their eyes. “So taste My punishment
and My warnings.”
38. Early morning brought upon them endur-
ing punishment.
