2. Allah sent down to you:
- the Book with the Truth, confirming what came before it
- the Torah
- the Gospel.

4. He also sent down the the Criterion before those, <!-- aforetime, --> as guidance for mankind. 

Those who have rejected Allah’s signs will have a severe punishment. Allah is able to take revenge.

5. Nothing is hidden from Allah, on earth or in the heaven.

6. It is He who forms you in the wombs as He wills. There is no god except He, the Almighty, the Wise.

7. It is He who revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are definitive; they are the foun-
dation of the Book, and others are unspecific.

As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow the unspecific part, seeking descent,
and seeking to derive an interpretation. But none knows its interpretation except Allah
and those firmly rooted in knowledge say, “We believe in it; all is from our Lord.” But
none recollects except those with understanding.

8. “Our Lord, do not cause our hearts to swerve after You have guided us, and bestow
on us mercy from Your presence; You are the Giver.”

9. “Our Lord, You will gather the people for a Day in which there is no doubt.” Allah will never break His promise.

10. As for those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children will avail them any-
thing against Allah. These will be fuel for the Fire.

11. Like the behavior of Pharaoh’s people and those before them. They rejected Our signs,
so Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is Strict in retribution.

12. Say to those who disbelieve, “You will be defeated, and rounded up into Hell—an awful resting-place.”

13. There was a sign for you in the two parties that met. One party fighting in the way of Al-
lah, and the other was disbelieving. They saw them with their own eyes twice their number.
But Allah supports with His help whomever He wills. In that is a lesson for those with insight.

14. Adorned for the people is the love of desires, such as women, and children, and piles
upon piles of gold and silver, and branded horses, and livestock, and fields. These are
the conveniences of the worldly life, but with Allah lies the finest resort.

15. Say, “Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who are righteous, with their Lord are Gardens beneath which
rivers flow, where they will remain forever, and purified spouses, and acceptance from
Allah.” Allah is Observant of the servants.

16. Those who say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us our sins, and save us
from the suffering of the Fire.”

17. The patient, and the truthful, and the reverent, and the charitable, and the seekers of
forgiveness at dawn.

18. Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, as do the angels, and those endowed with
knowledge—upholding justice. <!-- There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. -->

19. Religion with Allah is Islam. Those to whom the Scripture was given differed only
after knowledge came to them, out of envy among themselves. Whoever rejects the signs
of Allah—Allah is quick to take account.

20. If they argue with you, say, “I have surrendered myself to Allah, and those who follow
me.” And say to those who were given the Scripture, and to the unlearned, “Have you
surrendered?” If they have surrendered, then they are guided; but if they turn away, then
your duty is to convey. Allah is Seeing of the servants.
21. As for those who defy Allah’s revelations, and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those
who advocate justice among the people—promise them a painful retribution.
22. They are those whose deeds will come to nothing, in this world and in the Hereafter;
and they will have no saviors.

23. Have you not considered those who were given a share of the Scripture, as they were
called to the Scripture of Allah to arbitrate between them; then some of them turned back,
and declined?

24. That is because they said, “The Fire will not touch us except for a limited number of
days.” They have been misled in their religion by the lies they fabricated.
25. How about when We gather them for a Day in which there is no doubt, and each soul
will be paid in full for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged?
26. Say, “O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty. You grant sovereignty to whom You will, and You
strip sovereignty from whom you will. You honor whom you will, and You humiliate whom you will. In Your hand is all goodness. You are Capable of all things.”
27. “You merge the night into the day, and You merge the day into the night; and you
bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living; and You provide for whom you will without measure.”
