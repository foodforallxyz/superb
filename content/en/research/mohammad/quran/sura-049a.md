{{< s v="1" >}}  Do not place your opinions above that of Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah. 
{{< s v="2" >}}  Muslims,  Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loudly to him, as you speak loudly to one another, lest your works be in vain without you realizing. 
{{< s v="3" >}}  Those who lower their voices before Allah’s Messenger—those are they whose hearts Al-
lah has tested for piety. They will have forgiveness and a great reward.{{< s v="4" >}}  Those who call you from behind the chambers—most of them do not understand.{{< s v="5" >}}  Had they remained patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for
them. But Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

6. Muslims,  If a troublemaker brings you any news, investigate, lest you harm peo-
ple out of ignorance, and you become regretful for what you have done.
7. And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah. Had he obeyed you in many things,
you would have suffered hardship. But Allah has given you the love of faith, and adorned
it in your hearts, and made disbelief, mischief, and rebellion hateful to you. These are
the rightly guided.

8. A Grace and Favor from Allah. Allah is Knowing and Wise.{{< s v="9" >}}  If two groups of believers fight each other,
reconcile between them. But if one group ag-
gresses against the other, fight the aggressing
group until it complies with Allah’s com-
mand. Once it has complied, reconcile be-
tween them with justice, and be equitable. Al-
lah loves the equitable.{{< s v="10" >}}  The believers are brothers, so reconcile be-
tween your brothers, and remain conscious
of Allah, so that you may receive mercy.{{< s v="11" >}}  Muslims,  No people shall ridicule
other people, for they may be better than
they. Nor shall any women ridicule other
women, for they may be better than they. Nor
shall you slander one another, nor shall you
insult one another with names. Evil is the re-
turn to wickedness after having attained
faith. Whoever does not repent—these are
the wrongdoers.
12. Muslims,  Avoid most suspi-
cion—some suspicion is sinful. And do not
spy on one another, nor backbite one an-
other. Would any of you like to eat the flesh
of his dead brother? You would detest it. So
remain mindful of Allah. Allah is Most Re-
lenting, Most Merciful.
13. O people! We created you from a male and
a female, and made you races and tribes, that
you may know one another. The best among
you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous.
Allah is All-Knowing, Well-Experienced.
14. The Desert-Arabs say, “We have believed.”
Say, “You have not believed; but say, ‘We
have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered
into your hearts. But if you obey Allah and
His Messenger, He will not diminish any of
your deeds. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.”
15. The believers are those who believe in Al-
lah and His Messenger, and then have not
doubted, and strive for Allah’s cause with
their wealth and their persons. These are the
sincere.
{{< s v="16" >}}Say, “Are you going to teach Allah about
your religion, when Allah knows everything
in the heavens and the earth, and Allah is
aware of all things?”
17. They regarded it a favor to you that they
have submitted. Say, “Do not consider your
submission a favor to me; it is Allah who has
done you a favor by guiding you to the faith,
if you are sincere.”
18. Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is seeing of everything you do.
