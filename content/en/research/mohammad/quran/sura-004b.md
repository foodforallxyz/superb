15. Those of your women who commit lewdness, you must have four witnesses against
them, from among you. 

If they testify, confine them to the homes until death claims them, or Allah makes a way for them.

16. If two men among you commit it, punish them both. But if they repent and reform,
leave them alone. Allah is Full of Mercy.

17. Repentance is available from Allah for those who commit evil out of ignorance, and
then repent soon after. These—Allah will relent towards them. Allah is Knowing and Wise.

But repentance is not available for those who commit evils, until when death ap-
proaches one of them, he says, “Now I repent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers.
These—We have prepared for them a painful torment.

19. O you who believe! It is not permitted for you to inherit women against their will. And
do not coerce them in order to take away some of what you had given them, unless they
commit a proven adultery. And live with them in kindness. If you dislike them, it may
be that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good.

20. If you wish to replace one wife with another, and you have given one of them a for-
tune, take nothing back from it. Would you take it back fraudulently and sinfully?

21. And how can you take it back, when you have been intimate with one another, and
they have received from you a solid commitment?

22. Do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what is already past. That is improper, indecent, and a bad custom.

23. Forbidden for you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts,
your maternal aunts, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your foster-mothers who nursed you, your sisters

through nursing, your wives' mothers, and your stepdaughters in your guardianship—
born of wives you have gone into—but if you
have not gone into them, there is no blame on
you. And the wives of your genetic sons, and
marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except
what is past.


24. And all married women, except those you rightfully possess. This is Allah’s decree,
binding upon you. Permitted for you are those that lie outside these limits, provided
you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts from your property, seeking wedlock, not
prostitution. 

If you wish to enjoy them, then give them their dowry—a legal obligation. You commit no error by agreeing to any change to the dowry. 


25. If any of you lack the means to marry free believing women, he may marry one of the
believing maids under your control. Allah is well aware of your faith. You are from one
another. Marry them with the permission of their guardians, and give them their recompense fairly—to be protected—neither committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers.
When they are married, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half that of
free women. That is for those among you who fear falling into decadence. But to practice self-restraint is better for you. 


26. Allah intends to make things clear to you,
and to guide you in the ways of those before
you, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Knowing, Most Wise.
27. Allah intends to redeem you, but those who follow their desires want you to turn
away utterly. 
28. Allah intends to lighten your burden, for
the human being was created weak.
29. O you who believe! Do not consume each
other’s wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual
consent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah
is Merciful towards you.
30. Whoever does that, out of hostility and
wrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire.
And that would be easy for Allah.
31. If you avoid the worst of what you are for-
bidden, We will remit your sins, and admit
you by a Gate of Honor.
32. Do not covet what Allah has given to some
of you in preference to others. For men is a
share of what they have earned, and for
women is a share of what they have earned.
And ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has
knowledge of everything.
33. To everyone We have assigned beneficiar-
ies in what is left by parents and relatives.
Those with whom you have made an agree-
ment, give them their share. Allah is Witness
over all things.
34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of
women, as Allah has given some of them an
advantage over others, and because they
spend out of their wealth. The good women
are obedient, guarding what Allah would
have them guard. As for those from whom
you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and
abandon them in their beds, then strike them.
But if they obey you, seek no way against
them. Allah is Sublime, Great.
35. If you fear a breach between the two, ap-
point an arbiter from his family and an arbi-
ter from her family. If they wish to reconcile,
Allah will bring them together. Allah is
Knowledgeable, Expert.
36. Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to
Him, and be good to the parents, and the rel-
atives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the
neighbor next door, and the distant neighbor,
and the close associate, and the traveler, and
your servants. Allah does not love the arro-
gant showoff.
37. Those who are stingy, and exhort people to
stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given
them from His bounty. We have prepared for
the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.
38. And those who spend their money to be
seen by people, and believe neither in Allah
nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a
companion—what an evil companion.
39. What would they have lost, had they be-
lieved in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out
of what Allah has provided for them? Allah
knows them very well.
40. Allah does not commit an atom's weight of
injustice; and if there is a good deed, He dou-
bles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime
compensation.
41. Then how will it be, when We bring a wit-
ness from every community, and We bring
you as a witness against these?
42. On that Day, those who disbelieved and
disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the
earth were leveled over them. They will con-
ceal nothing from Allah.
