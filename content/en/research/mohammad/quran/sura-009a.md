{{< s v="1" >}} Give a declaration of immunity coming from Allah and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.

{{< s v="2" >}} Travel the land for 4 months. 

{{< s v="3" >}}  And a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the
Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If
you repent, it will be better for you. 

But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape Allah. And announce to those who disbelieve a
painful punishment.
{{< s v="4" >}}  Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. 

So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term.
{{< s v="5" >}}  When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. 

6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allah; then escort him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.

7. How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of Allah and His Messenger,
except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? 

As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them.

8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they
respect neither kinship nor treaty with you.
They satisfy you with lip service, but their
hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.
{{< s v="9" >}}  They traded away Allah's revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others from His
path. How evil is what they did.
{{< s v="10" >}}  Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the transgressors.
{{< s v="11" >}}  But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity, then they are
your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people who know.

12. But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion, then fight
the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith so that they may desist.

13. Will you not fight a people who violated their oaths, and planned to exile the Messenger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do
you fear them? It is Allah you should fear, if you are believers.

14. Fight them. Allah will punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help you
against them, and heal the hearts of a believing people.

15. And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah redeems whomever He wills.
Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise.
{{< s v="16" >}}Or do you think that you will be left alone,
without Allah identifying which of you will
strive, and take no supporters apart from Al-
lah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah
is well Aware of what you do.
17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Allah’s
places of worship while professing their dis-
belief. These—their works are in vain, and in
the Fire they will abide.
18. The only people to attend Allah’s places of
worship are those who believe in Allah and
the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice
regular charity, and fear none but Allah.
These are most likely to be guided.
19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims
and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same
as believing in Allah and the Last Day and
striving in Allah’s path? They are not equal in
Allah’s sight. Allah does not guide the unjust
people.
20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and
strive in Allah’s path with their possessions
and their persons, are of a higher rank with
Allah. These are the winners.
21. Their Lord announces to them good news
of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar-
dens wherein they will have lasting bliss.
22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a
great reward.
23. Muslims,  Do not ally yourselves
with your parents and your siblings if they
prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you al-
lies himself with them—these are the wrong-
doers.
24. Say, “If your parents, and your children,
and your siblings, and your spouses, and your
relatives, and the wealth you have acquired,
and a business you worry about, and homes
you love, are more dear to you than Allah,
and His Messenger, and the struggle in His
cause, then wait until Allah executes His
judgment.” Allah does not guide the sinful
people.
25. Allah has given you victory in numerous
regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great
number impressed you, but it availed you
nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was,
narrowed for you; and you turned your backs
in retreat.
26. Then Allah sent down His serenity upon
His Messenger, and upon the believers; and
He sent down troops you did not see; and He
punished those who disbelieved. Such is the
recompense of the disbelievers.
27. Then, after that, Allah will relent towards
whomever He wills. Allah is Forgiving and
Merciful.
28. Muslims,  The polytheists are pol-
luted, so let them not approach the Sacred
Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you collectively, as they fight you collectively, and
know that Allah is with the righteous.

37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief—by which those who disbelieve are led astray.
They allow it one year, and forbid it another
year, in order to conform to the number
made sacred by Allah, thus permitting what
Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds
seems good to them. Allah does not guide the
disbelieving people.
38. Muslims,  What is the matter with
you, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the
cause of Allah,” you cling heavily to the
earth? Do you prefer the present life to the
Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life,
compared to the Hereafter, is only a little.
39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you
most painfully, and will replace you with an-
other people, and you will not harm Him at
all. Allah has power over all things.
40. If you do not help him, Allah has already
helped him, when those who disbelieved ex-
pelled him, and he was the second of two in
the cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry,
Allah is with us.” And Allah made His tran-
quility descend upon him, and supported
him with forces you did not see, and made the
word of those who disbelieved the lowest,
while the Word of Allah is the Highest. Allah
is Mighty and Wise.
41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with
your possessions and your lives in the cause
of Allah. That is better for you, if you only
knew.
42. Had the gain been immediate, and the
journey shorter, they would have followed
you; but the distance seemed too long for
them. Still they swear by Allah: “Had we been
able, we would have marched out with you.”
They damn their own souls, and Allah knows
that they are lying.
43. May Allah pardon you! Why did you give
them permission before it became clear to
you who are the truthful ones, and who are
the liars?


fear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His
grace, if He wills. Allah is Aware and Wise.
29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah,
nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah
and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide
by the religion of truth—from among those
who received the Scripture—until they pay
the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.
30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Allah,”
and the Christians said, “The Messiah is the
son of Allah.” These are their statements, out
of their mouths. They emulate the statements
of those who blasphemed before. May Allah
assail them! How deceived they are!
31. They have taken their rabbis and their
priests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the
Messiah son of Mary. Although they were
commanded to worship none but The One
God. There is no god except He. Glory be to
Him; High above what they associate with
Him.
32. They want to extinguish Allah’s light with
their mouths, but Allah refuses except to
complete His light, even though the disbe-
lievers dislike it.
33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the
guidance and the religion of truth, in order to
make it prevail over all religions, even though
the idolaters dislike it.
34. Muslims,  Many of the rabbis and
priests consume people's wealth illicitly, and
hinder from Allah’s path. Those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend them in Allah’s cause, inform them of a painful punishment.

35. On the Day when they will be heated in the Fire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their
sides, and their backs will be branded with them: “This is what you hoarded for your-
selves; so taste what you used to hoard.”

36. The number of months, according to Allah, is twelve months—in the decree of Al-
lah—since the Day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are sacred. This
is the correct religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them. And fight the polytheists that they do not approach the prayer except
lazily, and that they do not spend except grudgingly.

55. Let neither their possessions nor their children impress you. Allah intends to torment
them through them in this worldly life, and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers.

56. They swear by Allah that they are of you.

But they are not of you. They are divisive people.

57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a hideout, they would go to it, rushing.
58. And among them are those who criticize you in regard to charities. If they are given
some of it, they become pleased; but if they are not given any, they grow resentful.
59. If only they were content with what Allah and His Messenger have given them, and
said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger;
to Allah we eagerly turn.”

60. Charities are for the poor, and the destitute, and those who administer them, and for
reconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and
for those in debt, and in the path of Allah, and
for the traveler in need—an obligation from
Allah. 

61. And among them are those who insult the Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He lis-
tens for your own good. He believes in Allah, and trusts the believers, and is mercy for
those of you who believe.” Those who insult the Messenger of Allah will have a painful penalty.

62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. But it is more proper for them to please Allah
and His Messenger, if they are believers. 

63. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the supreme disgrace.

64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from striving with their possessions and their lives. Allah is fully aware of the righteous.

45. Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their
hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in their doubts.
46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would
have made preparations for it; but Allah disliked their participation, so he held them
back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those who stay behind.”

47. Had they mobilized with you, they would
have added only to your difficulties, and they
would have spread rumors in your midst, try-
ing to sow discord among you. Some of you
are avid listeners to them. Allah is Aware of
the wrongdoers.
48. They tried to cause conflict before, and
they hatched plots against you, until the truth
prevailed, and the command of Allah became
evident—in spite of their dislike.
49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me,
and do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk
into trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the dis-
believers.
50. If something good happens to you, it up-
sets them; and if a calamity befalls you, they
say, “We took our precautions in advance,”
and they depart, happy.
51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except
what Allah has ordained for us; He is our Pro-
tector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.
52. Say, “Are you expecting for us anything
other than one of the two excellences? As for
us: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you
with a punishment from Himself, or at our
hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”
53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or un-
willingly, it will not be accepted from you.
You are evil people.”
54. What prevents the acceptance of their con-
tributions is nothing but the fact that they
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and

the Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al-
lah is even greater. That is the supreme
achievement.

73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers
and the hypocrites, and be stern with them.
Their abode is Hell—what a miserable destination!

74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing;
but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and
they renounced faith after their submission.
And they plotted what they could not attain.

They were resentful only because Allah and
His Messenger have enriched them out of His
grace. If they repent, it would be best for
them; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict
them with a painful punishment—in this life
and in the Hereafter—and they will have on
earth no protector and no savior.

75. Among them are those who promised Al-
lah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do-
nate and be among the upright.”
76. But when He has given them of His bounty,
they became stingy with it, and turned away
in aversion.
77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in
their hearts, until the Day they face Him—be-
cause they broke their promise to Allah, and
because they used to lie.
78. Do they not know that Allah knows their
secrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah
is the Knower of the unseen?
79. Those who criticize the believers who give
charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who
find nothing to give except their own ef-
forts—Allah ridicules them. They will have a
painful punishment.
80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or
do not ask forgiveness for them—even if you
ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah
will not forgive them. That is because they
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Al-
lah does not guide the immoral people.
81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their
staying behind the Messenger of Allah. And
they hated to strive with their wealth and
their lives in Allah’s way. And they said, “Do
is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah
will bring out what you fear.”
65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were
just joking and playing.” Say, “Were you
making jokes about Allah, His revelations,
and His Messenger?”
66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved af-
ter your belief. If We pardon some of you, We
will punish others, because they are guilty.
67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women
are of one another. They advocate evil, and
prohibit righteousness, and withhold their
hands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them.
The hypocrites are the sinners.
68. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and
hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the
Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their
due. And Allah has cursed them. They will
have a lasting punishment.
69. Like those before you. They were more
powerful than you, and had more wealth and
children. They enjoyed their share, and you
enjoyed your share, as those before you en-
joyed their share. And you indulged, as they
indulged. It is they whose works will fail in
this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who
are the losers.
70. Have they not heard the stories of those be-
fore them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and
Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and
the inhabitants of Median, and the Over-
turned Cities? Their messengers came to
them with the clear proofs. Allah never
wronged them, but they used to wrong their
own selves.
71. The believing men and believing women
are friends of one another. They advocate vir-
tue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice
charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger.
These—Allah will have mercy on them. Allah
is Noble and Wise.
72. Allah promises the believers, men and
women, gardens beneath which rivers flow,
abiding therein forever, and fine homes in



not venture out in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of
Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.”

82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in recompense for what they used to earn.

83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, and they ask your permission to go out, say,
“You will not go out with me, ever, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were
content to sit back the first time, so sit back with those who stay behind.”

84. You are never to pray over anyone of them who dies, nor are you to stand at his grave-
side. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were sinners.

85. Do not let their possessions and their children impress you. Allah desires to torment
them through them in this world, and their souls expire while they are disbelievers.

86. When a chapter is revealed, stating: “Be-
lieve in Allah and strive with His Messenger,”
the prominent among them ask you for ex-
emption. They say, “Allow us to stay with
those who stay behind.”
87. They prefer to be with those who stay be-
hind. Their hearts were sealed, so they do not
understand.
88. But the Messenger and those who believe
with him struggle with their possessions and
their lives. These have deserved the good
things. These are the successful.
89. Allah has prepared for them gardens be-
neath which rivers flow, wherein they will
abide forever. That is the great victory.
90. Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make
excuses, asking to be granted exemption,
while those who were untrue to Allah and His
Messenger stayed behind. A painful punish-
ment will afflict those among them who dis-
believed.
91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the
sick, nor on those who have nothing to give,
provided they are true to Allah and His Mes-
senger. In no way can the righteous be
blamed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing
to ride with you, and you said, “I have noth-
ing to carry you on.” So they went away, with
their eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing
for not finding the means to spend.
93. But blame is on those who ask you for ex-
emption, although they are rich. They are
content to be with those who stay behind. Al-
lah has sealed their hearts, so they do not
know.
94. They present excuses to you when you re-
turn to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we
do not trust you; Allah has informed us of
you. And Allah will watch your actions, and
so will the Messenger; then you will be re-
turned to the Knower of the Invisible and the
Visible, and He will inform you of what you
used to do.”
95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you
return to them, that you may leave them
alone. So leave them alone. They are a dis-
grace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for
what they used to earn.
96. They will swear to you that you may accept
them. But even if you accept them, Allah does
not accept the wicked people.
97. The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in
disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to
ignore the limits that Allah revealed to His
Messenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
98. And among the Desert-Arabs are those
who consider their contribution to be a fine.
And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes.
Upon them will fall the cycle of misfortune.
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
99. Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who
believe in Allah and the Last Day, and con-
sider their contribution to be a means to-
wards Allah, and the prayers of the Messen-
ger. Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah
will admit them into His mercy. Allah is For-
giving and Compassionate.
100. The Pioneers—The first of the Migrants
and the Supporters, and those who followed
them in righteousness. Allah is pleased with
them, and they are pleased with Him. He has
719. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with
him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not
guide the unjust people.
110. The structure which they built will remain
questionable in their hearts, until their hearts
are stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
111. Allah has purchased from the believers
their lives and their properties in exchange
for Paradise. They fight in Allah’s way, and
they kill and get killed. It is a promise binding
on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the
Quran. And who is more true to his promise
than Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex-
change—that is the supreme triumph.
112. Those who repent, those who worship,
those who praise, those who journey, those
who kneel, those who bow down, those who
advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and
those who keep Allah’s limits—give good
news to the believers.
113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be-
lieve to ask forgiveness for the polytheists,
even if they are near relatives, after it has be-
come clear to them that they are people of
Hellfire.
114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father
only because of a promise he had made to
him. But when it became clear to him that he
was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him.
Abraham was kind and clement.
115. Allah would never lead a people astray, af-
ter He had guided them, until He makes clear
to them what they should guard against. Al-
lah has knowledge of all things.
1{{< s v="16" >}}To Allah belongs the dominion of the
heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He
causes death. And besides Allah, you have
neither protector, nor supporter.
117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the
Emigrants, and the Supporters—those who
followed him in the hour of difficulty—after
the hearts of some of them almost swerved.
Then He pardoned them. He is Kind towards
them, Compassionate.
118. Also towards the three who were left be-
hind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is,
prepared for them Gardens beneath which
rivers flow, where they will abide forever.
That is the sublime triumph.
101. Among the Desert-Arabs around you
there are some hypocrites, and among the in-
habitants of Medina too. They have become
adamant in hypocrisy. You do not know
them, but We know them. We will punish
them twice; then they will be returned to a se-
vere torment.
102. Others have confessed their sins, having
mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps
Allah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.
103. Receive contributions from their wealth,
to purify them and sanctify them with it; and
pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for
them. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
104. Do they not know that Allah accepts the
repentance of His servants, and that He re-
ceives the contributions, and that Allah is the
Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful?
105. Say, “Work. Allah will see your work, and
so will His Messenger, and the believers.
Then you will be returned to the Knower of
secrets and declarations, and He will inform
you of what you used to do.”
106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al-
lah’s decree, as to whether He will punish
them, or accept their repentance. Allah is
Aware and Wise.
107. Then there are those who establish a
mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis-
unity among the believers, and as an outpost
for those who fight Allah and His Messenger.
They will swear: “Our intentions are nothing
but good.” But Allah bears witness that they
are liars.
108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque
founded upon piety from the first day is wor-
thier of your standing in it. In it are men who
love to be purified. Allah loves those who pu-
rify themselves.
109. Is he who founds his structure upon piety
and acceptance from Allah better, or he who
founds his structure on the brink of a cliff



hearts, because they are a people who do not
understand.
128. There has come to you a messenger from
among yourselves, concerned over your suf-
fering, anxious over you. Towards the believ-
ers, he is compassionate and merciful.
129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for
me; there is no god except He; in Him I have
put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime
Throne.”
closed in on them, and their very souls closed
in on them, and they realized that there was
no refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re-
deemed them, so that they may repent. Allah
is the Redeemer, the Merciful.
119. Muslims,  Be conscious of Allah,
and be with the sincere.
120. It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and
the Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind
the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them-
selves to him. That is because they never suf-
fer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the
cause of Allah, nor do they take one step that
enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain an-
ything from an enemy, but it is recorded to
their credit as a righteous deed. Allah does
not waste the reward of the righteous.
121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small
or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is
recorded to their credit. That Allah may re-
ward them in accordance with the best of
their deeds.
122. It is not advisable for the believers to
march out altogether. Of every division that
marches out, let a group remain behind, to
gain understanding of the religion, and to no-
tify their people when they have returned to
them, that they may beware.
123. Muslims,  Fight those of the dis-
believers who attack you, and let them find
severity in you, and know that Allah is with
the righteous.
124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of
them say, “Which of you has this increased in
faith?” As for those who believe: it increases
them in faith, and they rejoice.
125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick-
ness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and
they die as unbelievers.
126. Do they not see that they are tested once
or twice every year? Yet they do not repent,
and they do not learn.
127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they
look at one another, “Does anyone see you?”
Then they slip away. Allah has diverted their



{{< s v="10" >}}  JONAH (Yunus)

<!-- Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the Wise Book. -->
{{< s v="2" >}}  Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired
a man from among them: “Warn mankind,
and give good news to those who believe that
they are on a sound footing with their Lord”?
The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor-
cerer.”{{< s v="3" >}}  Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens
and the earth in six days, then settled over the
Throne, governing all things. There is no in-
tercessor except after His permission. Such is
Allah, your Lord—so serve Him. Will you not
reflect?{{< s v="4" >}}  To Him is your return, altogether. The
promise of Allah is true. He originates crea-
tion, and then He repeats it, to reward those
who believe and do good deeds with equity.
As for those who disbelieve, for them is a
drink of boiling water, and agonizing tor-
ment, on account of their disbelief.{{< s v="5" >}}  It is He who made the sun radiant, and the
moon a light, and determined phases for it—
that you may know the number of years and
the calculation. Allah did not create all this
except with truth. He details the revelations
for a people who know.

6. In the alternation of night and day, and in
what Allah created in the heavens and the
earth, are signs for people who are aware.
7. Those who do not hope to meet Us, and are
content with the worldly life, and are at ease
in it, and those who pay no heed to Our signs.
8. These—their dwelling is the Fire—on ac-
count of what they used to do.{{< s v="9" >}}  As for those who believe and do good deeds,
their Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers
will flow beneath them in the Gardens of
Bliss.{{< s v="10" >}}  Their call therein is, “Glory be to You, our
God.” And their greeting therein is, “Peace.”
And the last of their call is, “Praise be to Al-
lah, Lord of the Worlds.”{{< s v="11" >}}  If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the
people, as they wish to accelerate the good,
their term would have been fulfilled. But We
leave those who do not expect Our encounter
to blunder in their excesses.
12. Whenever adversity touches the human
being, he prays to Us—reclining on his side,
or sitting, or standing. But when We have re-
lieved his adversity from him, he goes away,
as though he had never called on Us for trou-
ble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of
the transgressors appear good to them.
13. We destroyed generations before you when
they did wrong. Their messengers came to
them with clear signs, but they would not be-
lieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.
14. Then We made you successors on earth af-
ter them, to see how you would behave.
15. And when Our clear revelations are recited
to them, those who do not hope to meet Us
say, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change
it.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my
own accord. I only follow what is revealed to
me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor-
ment of a terrible Day.”
{{< s v="16" >}}Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have
recited it to you, and He would not have
made it known to you. I have lived among you for a lifetime before it.

17. Who does greater wrong than someone who fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His
revelations? The guilty will never prosper.

18. And they worship, besides Allah, what neither harms them nor benefits them. And they
say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.”

Say, “Are you informing Allah about what He
does not know in the heavens or on earth?”
Glorified be He, High above the associations
they make.

19. Mankind was a single community; then they differed. Were it not for a prior decree
from your Lord, the matters over which they
had disputed would have been settled.

20. And they say, “If only a miracle was sent
down to him from his Lord.” Say, “The realm
of the unseen belongs to Allah; so wait, I am
waiting with you.”

21. When We make the people taste mercy af-
ter some adversity has touched them, they
begin to scheme against Our revelations. Say,
“Allah is swifter in scheming.” Our envoys
are writing down what you scheme.
22. It is He who transports you across land and
sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a
favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging
wind arrives. The waves surge over them
from every side, and they realize that they are
besieged. Thereupon they pray to Allah, pro-
fessing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save
us from this, we will be among the apprecia-
tive.”
23. But then, when He has saved them, they
commit violations on earth, and oppose jus-
tice. O people! Your violations are against
your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the
present life. Then to Us is your return, and
We will inform you of what you used to do.
24. The likeness of the present life is this: water
that We send down from the sky is absorbed by the plants of the earth, from which the people and the animals eat. Until, when the earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beautified, and its inhabitants think that they have mastered it, Our command descends upon it
by night or by day, and We turn it into stubble, as if it had not flourished the day before.
We thus clarify the revelations for people who reflect.
25. Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and
guides whomever He wills to a straight path.
26. For those who have done good is goodness,
and more. Neither gloom nor shame will
come over their faces. These are the inhabit-
ants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a
reward of similar evil, and shame will cover
them. They will have no defense against Al-
lah—as if their faces are covered with dark
patches of night. These are the inmates of the
Fire, abiding therein forever.
28. On the Day when We will gather them al-
together, then say to those who ascribed part-
ners, “To your place, you and your partners.”
Then We will separate between them, and
their partners will say, “It was not us you were
worshiping.”
29. “Allah is sufficient witness between us and
you. We were unaware of your worshiping us.”
30. There, every soul will experience what it
had done previously; and they will be returned to Allah, their True Master; and what
they used to invent will fail them.

31. Say, “Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? And who controls the
hearing and the sight? And who produces the
living from the dead, and produces the dead
from the living? And who governs the Order?” They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not be careful?”

32. Such is Allah, your Lord—the True. What is there, beyond the truth, except falsehood?
How are you turned away? 

33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true
against those who disobeyed, for they do not
believe.
34. Say, “Can any of your partners initiate cre-
ation, and then repeat it?” Say, “Allah initi-
ates creation, and then repeats it. How are
you so deluded?”
35. Say, “Can any of your partners guide to the
truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is He
who guides to the truth more worthy of being
followed, or he who does not guide, unless he
himself is guided? What is the matter with
you? How do you judge?”
36. Most of them follow nothing but assump-
tions; and assumptions avail nothing against
the truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.
37. This Quran could not have been produced
by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a
confirmation of what preceded it, and an
elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt
about it—it is from the Lord of the Universe.
38. Or do they say, “He has forged it”? Say,
“Then produce a single chapter like it, and
call upon whomever you can, apart from Al-
lah, if you are truthful.”
39. In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits
of their knowledge, and whose explanation
has not yet reached them. Thus those before
them refused to believe. So note the conse-
quences for the wrongdoers.
40. Among them are those who believe in it,
and among them are those who do not be-
lieve in it. Your Lord is fully aware of the mis-
chief-makers.
41. If they accuse you of lying, say, “I have my
deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit
of what I do, and I am quit of what you do.”
42. And among them are those who listen to
you. But can you make the deaf hear, even
though they do not understand?
43. And among them are those who look at
you. But can you guide the blind, even
though they do not see?
44. Allah does not wrong the people in the
least, but the people wrong their own selves.
45. On the Day when He rounds them up—as
if they had tarried only one hour of a day—
they will recognize one another. Those who denied the meeting with Allah will be the los-
ers. They were not guided.
46. Whether We show you some of what We promise them, or take you, to Us is their re-
turn. Allah is witness to everything they do.
47. Every community has a messenger. When their messenger has come, judgment will be
passed between them with fairness, and they will not be wronged.
48. And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
49. Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit myself, except as Allah wills. To every nation
is an appointed time. Then, when their time
arrives, they can neither postpone it by one
hour, nor advance it.

50. Say, “Have you considered? If His punishment overtakes you by night or by day, what
part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?”

51. “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it? Now? When before you tried to hasten it?”
52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong,
“Taste the torment of eternity. Will you be re-
warded except for what you used to do?”
53. And they inquire of you, “Is it true?” Say,
“Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot
evade it.”
54. Had every soul which had done wrong pos-
sessed everything on earth, it would offer it as
a ransom. They will hide the remorse when
they witness the suffering, and it will be
judged between them equitably, and they will
not be wronged.
55. Assuredly, to Allah belongs everything in
the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the
promise of Allah is true. But most of them do
not know.
56. He gives life and causes death, and to Him
you will be returned.
57. O people! There has come to you advice
from your Lord, and healing for what is in the
hearts, and guidance and mercy for the be-
lievers.
Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them
rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”
59. Say, “Have you considered the sustenance
Allah has sent down for you, some of which
you made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say,
“Did Allah give you permission, or do you
fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah?”
60. What will they think—those who fabricate
lies and attribute them to Allah—on the Day
of Resurrection? Allah is bountiful towards
the people, but most of them do not give
thanks.
61. You do not get into any situation, nor do
you recite any Quran, nor do you do any-
thing, but We are watching over you as you
undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom,
on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor
is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a
clear record.
62. Unquestionably, Allah’s friends have noth-
ing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

63. Those who believe and are aware.
For them is good news in this life, and in
the Hereafter. There is no alteration to the
words of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.
65. And let not their sayings dishearten you.
66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the
heavens and everyone on earth. Those who
invoke other than Allah do not follow part-
ners; they follow only assumptions, and they
only guess.
67. It is He who made the night for your rest,
and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that
are signs for people who listen.
68. And they said, “Allah has taken a son.” Be
He glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is
everything in the heavens and everything on
earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are
you saying about Allah what you do not
know?
69. Say, “Those who fabricate lies about Allah
will not succeed.”
64.

70. Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us
is their return; then We will make them taste
the severe punishment on account of their disbelief.
71. And relate to them the story of Noah, when
he said to his people, “O my people, if my
presence among you and my reminding you
of Allah’s signs is too much for you, then in
Allah I have put my trust. So come to a deci-
sion, you and your partners, and do not let
the matter perplex you; then carry out your
decision on me, and do not hold back.”
72. “But if you turn away, I have not asked you
for any wage. My wage falls only on Allah,
and I was commanded to be of those who
submit.”
73. But they denounced him, so We saved him
and those with him in the Ark, and We made
them successors, and We drowned those who
rejected Our signs. So consider the fate of
those who were warned.
74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to
their people. They came to them with the
clear proofs, but they would not believe in an-
ything they had already rejected. Thus We set
a seal on the hearts of the hostile.
75. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aa-
ron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig-
nitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were
sinful people.
76. And when the truth came to them from Us,
they said, “This is clearly sorcery.”
77. Moses said, “Is this what you say of the
truth when it has come to you? Is this sor-
cery? Sorcerers do not succeed.”
78. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us
from what we found our ancestors following,
and so that you become prominent in the
land? We will never believe in you.”
79. Pharaoh said, “Bring me every experienced
sorcerer.”
80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said
to them, “Throw whatever you have to
throw.”
81. And when they threw, Moses said, “What
you produced is sorcery, and Allah will make
it fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the
corrupt.”
82. “And Allah upholds the truth with His
words, even though the sinners detest it.”
83. But none believed in Moses except some
children of his people, for fear that Pharaoh
and his chiefs would persecute them. Phar-
aoh was high and mighty in the land. He was
a tyrant.
84. Moses said, “O my people, if you have be-
lieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if
you have submitted.”
85. They said, “In Allah we have put our trust.
Our Lord, do not make us victims of the op-
pressive people.”
86. “And deliver us, by Your mercy, from the
disbelieving people.”
87. And We inspired Moses and his brother,
“Settle your people in Egypt, and make your
homes places of worship, and perform the
prayer, and give good news to the believers.”
88. Moses said, “Our Lord, you have given
Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth
in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead
away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate
their wealth, and harden their hearts, they
will not believe until they see the painful tor-
ment.”
89. He said, “Your prayer has been answered,
so go straight, and do not follow the path of
those who do not know.”
90. And We delivered the Jews
across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur-
sued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until,
when he was about to drown, he said, “I be-
lieve that there is no god except the One the
Jews believe in, and I am of
those who submit.”
91. Now? When you have rebelled before, and
been of the mischief-makers?
92. Today We will preserve your body, so that
you become a sign for those after you. But
most people are heedless of Our signs. 

93. And We settled the Jews in a
position of honor, and provided them with
good things. They did not differ until
knowledge came to them. Your Lord will
judge between them on the Day of Resurrec-
tion regarding their differences.
94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed
to you, ask those who read the Scripture be-
fore you. The truth has come to you from
your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s
revelations, lest you become one of the losers.
96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is
justified will not believe.
97. Even if every sign comes to them—until
they see the painful punishment.
98. If only there was one town that believed
and benefited by its belief. Except for the peo-
ple of Jonah. When they believed, We re-
moved from them the suffering of disgrace in
the worldly life, and We gave them comfort
for a while.
99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth
would have believed. Will you compel people
to become believers?
100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s
leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who
refuse to understand.
101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and
the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no
avail for people who do not believe.
102. Do they expect anything but the likes of
the days of those who passed away before
them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with
you.”
103. Then We save Our messengers and those
who believe. It is binding on Us to save the
believers.
104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about
my religion—I do not serve those you serve
apart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one
who will terminate your lives. And I was
commanded to be of the believers.”
105. And dedicate yourself to the true reli-
gion—a monotheist—and never be of the
polytheists.
106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what
neither benefits you nor harms you. If you
do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.
107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can
remove it except He. And if He wants good
for you, none can repel His grace. He makes
it reach whomever He wills of His servants.
He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you
from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is
guided for his own soul; and whoever strays
only strays to its detriment. I am not a guard-
ian over you.”
109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be
patient until Allah issues His judgment, for
He is the Best of judges.
