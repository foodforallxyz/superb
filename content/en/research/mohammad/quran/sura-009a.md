{{< s v="1" >}} Give a declaration of immunity coming from Allah and His Messenger to the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty.

{{< s v="2" >}} Travel the land for 4 months. 

3. And a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the
Greater Pilgrimage, that Allah has disowned the polytheists, and so did His Messenger. If
you repent, it will be better for you. 

But if you turn away, know that you cannot escape Allah. And announce to those who disbelieve a
painful punishment.

4. Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. 

So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term.

5. When the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists wherever you find them. And capture them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. 

6. And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, give him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allah; then escort him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.

7. How can there be a treaty with the polytheists on the part of Allah and His Messenger,
except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque? 

As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them.

8. How? Whenever they overcome you, they
respect neither kinship nor treaty with you.
They satisfy you with lip service, but their
hearts refuse, and most of them are immoral.

9. They traded away Allah's revelations for a cheap price, so they barred others from His
path. How evil is what they did.

10. Towards a believer they respect neither kinship nor treaty. These are the transgressors.

11. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and give the obligatory charity, then they are
your brethren in faith. We detail the revelations for a people who know.

12. But if they violate their oaths after their pledge, and attack your religion, then fight
the leaders of disbelief—they have no faith so that they may desist.

13. Will you not fight a people who violated their oaths, and planned to exile the Messenger, and initiated hostilities against you? Do
you fear them? It is Allah you should fear, if you are believers.

14. Fight them. Allah will punish them at your hands, and humiliate them, and help you
against them, and heal the hearts of a believing people.

15. And He will remove the anger of their hearts. Allah redeems whomever He wills.
Allah is Knowledgeable and Wise.
16. Or do you think that you will be left alone,
without Allah identifying which of you will
strive, and take no supporters apart from Al-
lah, His Messenger, and the believers? Allah
is well Aware of what you do.
17. It is not for the polytheists to attend Allah’s
places of worship while professing their dis-
belief. These—their works are in vain, and in
the Fire they will abide.
18. The only people to attend Allah’s places of
worship are those who believe in Allah and
the Last Day, and pray regularly, and practice
regular charity, and fear none but Allah.
These are most likely to be guided.
19. Do you consider giving water to pilgrims
and maintaining the Sacred Mosque the same
as believing in Allah and the Last Day and
striving in Allah’s path? They are not equal in
Allah’s sight. Allah does not guide the unjust
people.
20. Those who believe, and emigrate, and
strive in Allah’s path with their possessions
and their persons, are of a higher rank with
Allah. These are the winners.
21. Their Lord announces to them good news
of mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gar-
dens wherein they will have lasting bliss.
22. Abiding therein forever. With Allah is a
great reward.
23. O you who believe! Do not ally yourselves
with your parents and your siblings if they
prefer disbelief to belief. Whoever of you al-
lies himself with them—these are the wrong-
doers.
24. Say, “If your parents, and your children,
and your siblings, and your spouses, and your
relatives, and the wealth you have acquired,
and a business you worry about, and homes
you love, are more dear to you than Allah,
and His Messenger, and the struggle in His
cause, then wait until Allah executes His
judgment.” Allah does not guide the sinful
people.
25. Allah has given you victory in numerous
regions; but on the day of Hunayn, your great
number impressed you, but it availed you
nothing; and the land, as spacious as it was,
narrowed for you; and you turned your backs
in retreat.
26. Then Allah sent down His serenity upon
His Messenger, and upon the believers; and
He sent down troops you did not see; and He
punished those who disbelieved. Such is the
recompense of the disbelievers.
27. Then, after that, Allah will relent towards
whomever He wills. Allah is Forgiving and
Merciful.
28. O you who believe! The polytheists are pol-
luted, so let them not approach the Sacred
Mosque after this year of theirs. And if you collectively, as they fight you collectively, and
know that Allah is with the righteous.

37. Postponement is an increase in disbelief—by which those who disbelieve are led astray.
They allow it one year, and forbid it another
year, in order to conform to the number
made sacred by Allah, thus permitting what
Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds
seems good to them. Allah does not guide the
disbelieving people.
38. O you who believe! What is the matter with
you, when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the
cause of Allah,” you cling heavily to the
earth? Do you prefer the present life to the
Hereafter? The enjoyment of the present life,
compared to the Hereafter, is only a little.
39. Unless you mobilize, He will punish you
most painfully, and will replace you with an-
other people, and you will not harm Him at
all. Allah has power over all things.
40. If you do not help him, Allah has already
helped him, when those who disbelieved ex-
pelled him, and he was the second of two in
the cave. He said to his friend, “Do not worry,
Allah is with us.” And Allah made His tran-
quility descend upon him, and supported
him with forces you did not see, and made the
word of those who disbelieved the lowest,
while the Word of Allah is the Highest. Allah
is Mighty and Wise.
41. Mobilize, light or heavy, and strive with
your possessions and your lives in the cause
of Allah. That is better for you, if you only
knew.
42. Had the gain been immediate, and the
journey shorter, they would have followed
you; but the distance seemed too long for
them. Still they swear by Allah: “Had we been
able, we would have marched out with you.”
They damn their own souls, and Allah knows
that they are lying.
43. May Allah pardon you! Why did you give
them permission before it became clear to
you who are the truthful ones, and who are
the liars?


fear poverty, Allah will enrich you from His
grace, if He wills. Allah is Aware and Wise.
29. Fight those who do not believe in Allah,
nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what Allah
and His Messenger have forbidden, nor abide
by the religion of truth—from among those
who received the Scripture—until they pay
the due tax, willingly or unwillingly.
30. The Jews said, “Ezra is the son of Allah,”
and the Christians said, “The Messiah is the
son of Allah.” These are their statements, out
of their mouths. They emulate the statements
of those who blasphemed before. May Allah
assail them! How deceived they are!
31. They have taken their rabbis and their
priests as lords instead of Allah, as well as the
Messiah son of Mary. Although they were
commanded to worship none but The One
God. There is no god except He. Glory be to
Him; High above what they associate with
Him.
32. They want to extinguish Allah’s light with
their mouths, but Allah refuses except to
complete His light, even though the disbe-
lievers dislike it.
33. It is He who sent His Messenger with the
guidance and the religion of truth, in order to
make it prevail over all religions, even though
the idolaters dislike it.
34. O you who believe! Many of the rabbis and
priests consume people's wealth illicitly, and
hinder from Allah’s path. Those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend them in Allah’s cause, inform them of a painful punishment.

35. On the Day when they will be heated in the Fire of Hell, then their foreheads, and their
sides, and their backs will be branded with them: “This is what you hoarded for your-
selves; so taste what you used to hoard.”

36. The number of months, according to Allah, is twelve months—in the decree of Al-
lah—since the Day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are sacred. This
is the correct religion. So do not wrong yourselves during them. And fight the polytheists that they do not approach the prayer except
lazily, and that they do not spend except grudgingly.

55. Let neither their possessions nor their children impress you. Allah intends to torment
them through them in this worldly life, and that their souls depart while they are disbelievers.

56. They swear by Allah that they are of you.

But they are not of you. They are divisive people.

57. Were they to find a shelter, or a cave, or a hideout, they would go to it, rushing.
58. And among them are those who criticize you in regard to charities. If they are given
some of it, they become pleased; but if they are not given any, they grow resentful.
59. If only they were content with what Allah and His Messenger have given them, and
said, “Allah is sufficient for us; Allah will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger;
to Allah we eagerly turn.”

60. Charities are for the poor, and the destitute, and those who administer them, and for
reconciling hearts, and for freeing slaves, and
for those in debt, and in the path of Allah, and
for the traveler in need—an obligation from
Allah. 

61. And among them are those who insult the Prophet, and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He lis-
tens for your own good. He believes in Allah, and trusts the believers, and is mercy for
those of you who believe.” Those who insult the Messenger of Allah will have a painful penalty.

62. They swear to you by Allah to please you. But it is more proper for them to please Allah
and His Messenger, if they are believers. 

63. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, will have the Fire of Hell, abiding in it forever? That is the supreme disgrace.

64. The hypocrites worry lest a chapter may be revealed about them, informing them of what
Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from striving with their possessions and their lives. Allah is fully aware of the righteous.

45. Only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their
hearts are full of doubts, so they waver in their doubts.
46. Had they wanted to mobilize, they would
have made preparations for it; but Allah disliked their participation, so he held them
back, and it was said, “Stay behind with those who stay behind.”

47. Had they mobilized with you, they would
have added only to your difficulties, and they
would have spread rumors in your midst, try-
ing to sow discord among you. Some of you
are avid listeners to them. Allah is Aware of
the wrongdoers.
48. They tried to cause conflict before, and
they hatched plots against you, until the truth
prevailed, and the command of Allah became
evident—in spite of their dislike.
49. Among them is he who says, “Excuse me,
and do not trouble me.” In fact, they sunk
into trouble. In fact, Hell will engulf the dis-
believers.
50. If something good happens to you, it up-
sets them; and if a calamity befalls you, they
say, “We took our precautions in advance,”
and they depart, happy.
51. Say, “Nothing will happen to us except
what Allah has ordained for us; He is our Pro-
tector.” In Allah let the faithful put their trust.
52. Say, “Are you expecting for us anything
other than one of the two excellences? As for
us: we are expecting that Allah will afflict you
with a punishment from Himself, or at our
hands. So wait, we are waiting with you.”
53. Say, “Whether you spend willingly or un-
willingly, it will not be accepted from you.
You are evil people.”
54. What prevents the acceptance of their con-
tributions is nothing but the fact that they
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and

the Gardens of Eden. But approval from Al-
lah is even greater. That is the supreme
achievement.

73. O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers
and the hypocrites, and be stern with them.
Their abode is Hell—what a miserable destination!

74. They swear by Allah that they said nothing;
but they did utter the word of blasphemy, and
they renounced faith after their submission.
And they plotted what they could not attain.

They were resentful only because Allah and
His Messenger have enriched them out of His
grace. If they repent, it would be best for
them; but if they turn away, Allah will afflict
them with a painful punishment—in this life
and in the Hereafter—and they will have on
earth no protector and no savior.

75. Among them are those who promised Al-
lah: “If He gives us of His bounty, we will do-
nate and be among the upright.”
76. But when He has given them of His bounty,
they became stingy with it, and turned away
in aversion.
77. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in
their hearts, until the Day they face Him—be-
cause they broke their promise to Allah, and
because they used to lie.
78. Do they not know that Allah knows their
secrets and their conspiracies? And that Allah
is the Knower of the unseen?
79. Those who criticize the believers who give
charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who
find nothing to give except their own ef-
forts—Allah ridicules them. They will have a
painful punishment.
80. Whether you ask forgiveness for them, or
do not ask forgiveness for them—even if you
ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah
will not forgive them. That is because they
disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. Al-
lah does not guide the immoral people.
81. Those who stayed behind rejoiced at their
staying behind the Messenger of Allah. And
they hated to strive with their wealth and
their lives in Allah’s way. And they said, “Do
is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking; Allah
will bring out what you fear.”
65. If you ask them, they will say, “We were
just joking and playing.” Say, “Were you
making jokes about Allah, His revelations,
and His Messenger?”
66. Do not apologize. You have disbelieved af-
ter your belief. If We pardon some of you, We
will punish others, because they are guilty.
67. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women
are of one another. They advocate evil, and
prohibit righteousness, and withhold their
hands. They forgot Allah, so He forgot them.
The hypocrites are the sinners.
68. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and
hypocrite women, and the disbelievers, the
Fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is their
due. And Allah has cursed them. They will
have a lasting punishment.
69. Like those before you. They were more
powerful than you, and had more wealth and
children. They enjoyed their share, and you
enjoyed your share, as those before you en-
joyed their share. And you indulged, as they
indulged. It is they whose works will fail in
this world and in the Hereafter. It is they who
are the losers.
70. Have they not heard the stories of those be-
fore them? The people of Noah, and Aad, and
Thamood; and the people of Abraham, and
the inhabitants of Median, and the Over-
turned Cities? Their messengers came to
them with the clear proofs. Allah never
wronged them, but they used to wrong their
own selves.
71. The believing men and believing women
are friends of one another. They advocate vir-
tue, forbid evil, perform the prayers, practice
charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger.
These—Allah will have mercy on them. Allah
is Noble and Wise.
72. Allah promises the believers, men and
women, gardens beneath which rivers flow,
abiding therein forever, and fine homes in



not venture out in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of
Hell is much hotter, if they only understood.”

82. Let them laugh a little, and weep much; in recompense for what they used to earn.

83. If Allah brings you back to a party of them, and they ask your permission to go out, say,
“You will not go out with me, ever, nor will you ever fight an enemy with me. You were
content to sit back the first time, so sit back with those who stay behind.”

84. You are never to pray over anyone of them who dies, nor are you to stand at his grave-
side. They rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were sinners.

85. Do not let their possessions and their children impress you. Allah desires to torment
them through them in this world, and their souls expire while they are disbelievers.

86. When a chapter is revealed, stating: “Be-
lieve in Allah and strive with His Messenger,”
the prominent among them ask you for ex-
emption. They say, “Allow us to stay with
those who stay behind.”
87. They prefer to be with those who stay be-
hind. Their hearts were sealed, so they do not
understand.
88. But the Messenger and those who believe
with him struggle with their possessions and
their lives. These have deserved the good
things. These are the successful.
89. Allah has prepared for them gardens be-
neath which rivers flow, wherein they will
abide forever. That is the great victory.
90. Some of the Desert-Arabs came to make
excuses, asking to be granted exemption,
while those who were untrue to Allah and His
Messenger stayed behind. A painful punish-
ment will afflict those among them who dis-
believed.
91. There is no blame on the weak, nor on the
sick, nor on those who have nothing to give,
provided they are true to Allah and His Mes-
senger. In no way can the righteous be
blamed. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
92. Nor on those who approach you, wishing
to ride with you, and you said, “I have noth-
ing to carry you on.” So they went away, with
their eyes overflowing with tears, sorrowing
for not finding the means to spend.
93. But blame is on those who ask you for ex-
emption, although they are rich. They are
content to be with those who stay behind. Al-
lah has sealed their hearts, so they do not
know.
94. They present excuses to you when you re-
turn to them. Say, “Do not offer excuses; we
do not trust you; Allah has informed us of
you. And Allah will watch your actions, and
so will the Messenger; then you will be re-
turned to the Knower of the Invisible and the
Visible, and He will inform you of what you
used to do.”
95. They will swear to you by Allah, when you
return to them, that you may leave them
alone. So leave them alone. They are a dis-
grace, and their destiny is Hell; a reward for
what they used to earn.
96. They will swear to you that you may accept
them. But even if you accept them, Allah does
not accept the wicked people.
97. The Desert-Arabs are the most steeped in
disbelief and hypocrisy, and the most likely to
ignore the limits that Allah revealed to His
Messenger. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
98. And among the Desert-Arabs are those
who consider their contribution to be a fine.
And they wait for a reversal of your fortunes.
Upon them will fall the cycle of misfortune.
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
99. Yet among the Desert-Arabs are those who
believe in Allah and the Last Day, and con-
sider their contribution to be a means to-
wards Allah, and the prayers of the Messen-
ger. Surely it will draw them closer, and Allah
will admit them into His mercy. Allah is For-
giving and Compassionate.
100. The Pioneers—The first of the Migrants
and the Supporters, and those who followed
them in righteousness. Allah is pleased with
them, and they are pleased with Him. He has
719. REPENTANCE (at-Tawbah)
that is about to tumble, so it tumbles with
him into the Fire of Hell? Allah does not
guide the unjust people.
110. The structure which they built will remain
questionable in their hearts, until their hearts
are stopped. Allah is Knowing and Wise.
111. Allah has purchased from the believers
their lives and their properties in exchange
for Paradise. They fight in Allah’s way, and
they kill and get killed. It is a promise binding
on Him in the Torah, and the Gospel, and the
Quran. And who is more true to his promise
than Allah? So rejoice in making such an ex-
change—that is the supreme triumph.
112. Those who repent, those who worship,
those who praise, those who journey, those
who kneel, those who bow down, those who
advocate righteousness and forbid evil, and
those who keep Allah’s limits—give good
news to the believers.
113. It is not for the Prophet and those who be-
lieve to ask forgiveness for the polytheists,
even if they are near relatives, after it has be-
come clear to them that they are people of
Hellfire.
114. Abraham asked forgiveness for his father
only because of a promise he had made to
him. But when it became clear to him that he
was an enemy of Allah, he disowned him.
Abraham was kind and clement.
115. Allah would never lead a people astray, af-
ter He had guided them, until He makes clear
to them what they should guard against. Al-
lah has knowledge of all things.
116. To Allah belongs the dominion of the
heavens and the earth. He gives life, and He
causes death. And besides Allah, you have
neither protector, nor supporter.
117. Allah has redeemed the Prophet, and the
Emigrants, and the Supporters—those who
followed him in the hour of difficulty—after
the hearts of some of them almost swerved.
Then He pardoned them. He is Kind towards
them, Compassionate.
118. Also towards the three who were left be-
hind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is,
prepared for them Gardens beneath which
rivers flow, where they will abide forever.
That is the sublime triumph.
101. Among the Desert-Arabs around you
there are some hypocrites, and among the in-
habitants of Medina too. They have become
adamant in hypocrisy. You do not know
them, but We know them. We will punish
them twice; then they will be returned to a se-
vere torment.
102. Others have confessed their sins, having
mixed good deeds with bad deeds. Perhaps
Allah will redeem them. Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.
103. Receive contributions from their wealth,
to purify them and sanctify them with it; and
pray for them. Your prayer is comfort for
them. Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
104. Do they not know that Allah accepts the
repentance of His servants, and that He re-
ceives the contributions, and that Allah is the
Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful?
105. Say, “Work. Allah will see your work, and
so will His Messenger, and the believers.
Then you will be returned to the Knower of
secrets and declarations, and He will inform
you of what you used to do.”
106. Others are held in suspense, awaiting Al-
lah’s decree, as to whether He will punish
them, or accept their repentance. Allah is
Aware and Wise.
107. Then there are those who establish a
mosque to cause harm, and disbelief, and dis-
unity among the believers, and as an outpost
for those who fight Allah and His Messenger.
They will swear: “Our intentions are nothing
but good.” But Allah bears witness that they
are liars.
108. Do not stand in it, ever. A mosque
founded upon piety from the first day is wor-
thier of your standing in it. In it are men who
love to be purified. Allah loves those who pu-
rify themselves.
109. Is he who founds his structure upon piety
and acceptance from Allah better, or he who
founds his structure on the brink of a cliff
7210. JONAH (Yunus)
hearts, because they are a people who do not
understand.
128. There has come to you a messenger from
among yourselves, concerned over your suf-
fering, anxious over you. Towards the believ-
ers, he is compassionate and merciful.
129. If they turn away, say, “Allah is enough for
me; there is no god except He; in Him I have
put my trust; He is the Lord of the Sublime
Throne.”
closed in on them, and their very souls closed
in on them, and they realized that there was
no refuge from Allah, except in Him, He re-
deemed them, so that they may repent. Allah
is the Redeemer, the Merciful.
119. O you who believe! Be conscious of Allah,
and be with the sincere.
120. It is not for the inhabitants of Medina and
the Desert-Arabs around them to stay behind
the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer them-
selves to him. That is because they never suf-
fer any thirst, nor fatigue, nor hunger in the
cause of Allah, nor do they take one step that
enrages the disbelievers, nor do they gain an-
ything from an enemy, but it is recorded to
their credit as a righteous deed. Allah does
not waste the reward of the righteous.
121. Nor do they spend any expenditure, small
or large, nor do they cross any valley, but it is
recorded to their credit. That Allah may re-
ward them in accordance with the best of
their deeds.
122. It is not advisable for the believers to
march out altogether. Of every division that
marches out, let a group remain behind, to
gain understanding of the religion, and to no-
tify their people when they have returned to
them, that they may beware.
123. O you who believe! Fight those of the dis-
believers who attack you, and let them find
severity in you, and know that Allah is with
the righteous.
124. Whenever a chapter is revealed, some of
them say, “Which of you has this increased in
faith?” As for those who believe: it increases
them in faith, and they rejoice.
125. But as for those in whose hearts is sick-
ness: it adds disgrace to their disgrace, and
they die as unbelievers.
126. Do they not see that they are tested once
or twice every year? Yet they do not repent,
and they do not learn.
127. And whenever a chapter is revealed, they
look at one another, “Does anyone see you?”
Then they slip away. Allah has diverted their

10. JONAH (Yunus)

Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the Wise Book.

2. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired
a man from among them: “Warn mankind,
and give good news to those who believe that
they are on a sound footing with their Lord”?
The disbelievers said, “This is a manifest sor-
cerer.”
3. Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens
and the earth in six days, then settled over the
Throne, governing all things. There is no in-
tercessor except after His permission. Such is
Allah, your Lord—so serve Him. Will you not
reflect?
4. To Him is your return, altogether. The
promise of Allah is true. He originates crea-
tion, and then He repeats it, to reward those
who believe and do good deeds with equity.
As for those who disbelieve, for them is a
drink of boiling water, and agonizing tor-
ment, on account of their disbelief.
5. It is He who made the sun radiant, and the
moon a light, and determined phases for it—
that you may know the number of years and
the calculation. Allah did not create all this
except with truth. He details the revelations
for a people who know.
1. 

you for a lifetime before it. Do you not un-
derstand?”
17. Who does greater wrong than someone
who fabricates lies about Allah, or denies His
revelations? The guilty will never prosper.
18. And they worship, besides Allah, what nei-
ther harms them nor benefits them. And they
say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.”
Say, “Are you informing Allah about what He
does not know in the heavens or on earth?”
Glorified be He, High above the associations
they make.
19. Mankind was a single community; then
they differed. Were it not for a prior decree
from your Lord, the matters over which they
had disputed would have been settled.
20. And they say, “If only a miracle was sent
down to him from his Lord.” Say, “The realm
of the unseen belongs to Allah; so wait, I am
waiting with you.”
21. When We make the people taste mercy af-
ter some adversity has touched them, they
begin to scheme against Our revelations. Say,
“Allah is swifter in scheming.” Our envoys
are writing down what you scheme.
22. It is He who transports you across land and
sea. Until, when you are on ships, sailing in a
favorable wind, and rejoicing in it, a raging
wind arrives. The waves surge over them
from every side, and they realize that they are
besieged. Thereupon they pray to Allah, pro-
fessing sincere devotion to Him: “If You save
us from this, we will be among the apprecia-
tive.”
23. But then, when He has saved them, they
commit violations on earth, and oppose jus-
tice. O people! Your violations are against
your own souls. It is the enjoyment of the
present life. Then to Us is your return, and
We will inform you of what you used to do.
24. The likeness of the present life is this: water
that We send down from the sky is absorbed
by the plants of the earth, from which the
people and the animals eat. Until, when the
earth puts on its fine appearance, and is beau-
tified, and its inhabitants think that they have
6. In the alternation of night and day, and in
what Allah created in the heavens and the
earth, are signs for people who are aware.
7. Those who do not hope to meet Us, and are
content with the worldly life, and are at ease
in it, and those who pay no heed to Our signs.
8. These—their dwelling is the Fire—on ac-
count of what they used to do.
9. As for those who believe and do good deeds,
their Lord guides them in their faith. Rivers
will flow beneath them in the Gardens of
Bliss.
10. Their call therein is, “Glory be to You, our
God.” And their greeting therein is, “Peace.”
And the last of their call is, “Praise be to Al-
lah, Lord of the Worlds.”
11. If Allah were to accelerate the ill for the
people, as they wish to accelerate the good,
their term would have been fulfilled. But We
leave those who do not expect Our encounter
to blunder in their excesses.
12. Whenever adversity touches the human
being, he prays to Us—reclining on his side,
or sitting, or standing. But when We have re-
lieved his adversity from him, he goes away,
as though he had never called on Us for trou-
ble that had afflicted him. Thus the deeds of
the transgressors appear good to them.
13. We destroyed generations before you when
they did wrong. Their messengers came to
them with clear signs, but they would not be-
lieve. Thus We requite the sinful people.
14. Then We made you successors on earth af-
ter them, to see how you would behave.
15. And when Our clear revelations are recited
to them, those who do not hope to meet Us
say, “Bring a Quran other than this, or change
it.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my
own accord. I only follow what is revealed to
me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the tor-
ment of a terrible Day.”
16. Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have
recited it to you, and He would not have
made it known to you. I have lived among
7410. JONAH (Yunus)
mastered it, Our command descends upon it
by night or by day, and We turn it into stub-
ble, as if it had not flourished the day before.
We thus clarify the revelations for people
who reflect.
25. Allah invites to the Home of Peace, and
guides whomever He wills to a straight path.
26. For those who have done good is goodness,
and more. Neither gloom nor shame will
come over their faces. These are the inhabit-
ants of Paradise, abiding therein forever.
27. As for those who have earned evil deeds: a
reward of similar evil, and shame will cover
them. They will have no defense against Al-
lah—as if their faces are covered with dark
patches of night. These are the inmates of the
Fire, abiding therein forever.
28. On the Day when We will gather them al-
together, then say to those who ascribed part-
ners, “To your place, you and your partners.”
Then We will separate between them, and
their partners will say, “It was not us you were
worshiping.”
29. “Allah is sufficient witness between us and
you. We were unaware of your worshiping
us.”
30. There, every soul will experience what it
had done previously; and they will be re-
turned to Allah, their True Master; and what
they used to invent will fail them.
31. Say, “Who provides for you from the
heaven and the earth? And who controls the
hearing and the sight? And who produces the
living from the dead, and produces the dead
from the living? And who governs the Or-
der?” They will say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you
not be careful?”
32. Such is Allah, your Lord—the True. What
is there, beyond the truth, except falsehood?
How are you turned away?
33. Thus your Lord’s Word proved true
against those who disobeyed, for they do not
believe.
34. Say, “Can any of your partners initiate cre-
ation, and then repeat it?” Say, “Allah initi-
ates creation, and then repeats it. How are
you so deluded?”
35. Say, “Can any of your partners guide to the
truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth. Is He
who guides to the truth more worthy of being
followed, or he who does not guide, unless he
himself is guided? What is the matter with
you? How do you judge?”
36. Most of them follow nothing but assump-
tions; and assumptions avail nothing against
the truth. Allah is fully aware of what they do.
37. This Quran could not have been produced
by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a
confirmation of what preceded it, and an
elaboration of the Book. There is no doubt
about it—it is from the Lord of the Universe.
38. Or do they say, “He has forged it”? Say,
“Then produce a single chapter like it, and
call upon whomever you can, apart from Al-
lah, if you are truthful.”
39. In fact, they deny what is beyond the limits
of their knowledge, and whose explanation
has not yet reached them. Thus those before
them refused to believe. So note the conse-
quences for the wrongdoers.
40. Among them are those who believe in it,
and among them are those who do not be-
lieve in it. Your Lord is fully aware of the mis-
chief-makers.
41. If they accuse you of lying, say, “I have my
deeds, and you have your deeds. You are quit
of what I do, and I am quit of what you do.”
42. And among them are those who listen to
you. But can you make the deaf hear, even
though they do not understand?
43. And among them are those who look at
you. But can you guide the blind, even
though they do not see?
44. Allah does not wrong the people in the
least, but the people wrong their own selves.
45. On the Day when He rounds them up—as
if they had tarried only one hour of a day—
they will recognize one another. Those who
7510. JONAH (Yunus)
denied the meeting with Allah will be the los-
ers. They were not guided.
46. Whether We show you some of what We
promise them, or take you, to Us is their re-
turn. Allah is witness to everything they do.
47. Every community has a messenger. When
their messenger has come, judgment will be
passed between them with fairness, and they
will not be wronged.
48. And they say, “When will this promise be
fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
49. Say, “I have no power to harm or benefit
myself, except as Allah wills. To every nation
is an appointed time. Then, when their time
arrives, they can neither postpone it by one
hour, nor advance it.
50. Say, “Have you considered? If His punish-
ment overtakes you by night or by day, what
part of it will the guilty seek to hasten?”
51. “Then, when it falls, will you believe in it?
Now? When before you tried to hasten it?”
52. Then it will be said to those who did wrong,
“Taste the torment of eternity. Will you be re-
warded except for what you used to do?”
53. And they inquire of you, “Is it true?” Say,
“Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot
evade it.”
54. Had every soul which had done wrong pos-
sessed everything on earth, it would offer it as
a ransom. They will hide the remorse when
they witness the suffering, and it will be
judged between them equitably, and they will
not be wronged.
55. Assuredly, to Allah belongs everything in
the heavens and the earth. Assuredly, the
promise of Allah is true. But most of them do
not know.
56. He gives life and causes death, and to Him
you will be returned.
57. O people! There has come to you advice
from your Lord, and healing for what is in the
hearts, and guidance and mercy for the be-
lievers.
Say, “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them
rejoice. That is better than what they hoard.”
59. Say, “Have you considered the sustenance
Allah has sent down for you, some of which
you made unlawful, and some lawful?” Say,
“Did Allah give you permission, or do you
fabricate lies and attribute them to Allah?”
60. What will they think—those who fabricate
lies and attribute them to Allah—on the Day
of Resurrection? Allah is bountiful towards
the people, but most of them do not give
thanks.
61. You do not get into any situation, nor do
you recite any Quran, nor do you do any-
thing, but We are watching over you as you
undertake it. Not even the weight of an atom,
on earth or in the sky, escapes your Lord, nor
is there anything smaller or larger, but is in a
clear record.
62. Unquestionably, Allah’s friends have noth-
ing to fear, nor shall they grieve.
58.
63. Those
who believe and are aware.
For them is good news in this life, and in
the Hereafter. There is no alteration to the
words of Allah. That is the supreme triumph.
65. And let not their sayings dishearten you.
All power is Allah’s. He is the Hearer, the
Knower.
66. Certainly, to Allah belongs everyone in the
heavens and everyone on earth. Those who
invoke other than Allah do not follow part-
ners; they follow only assumptions, and they
only guess.
67. It is He who made the night for your rest,
and the daylight for visibility. Surely in that
are signs for people who listen.
68. And they said, “Allah has taken a son.” Be
He glorified. He is the Self-Sufficient. His is
everything in the heavens and everything on
earth. Do you have any proof for this? Or are
you saying about Allah what you do not
know?
69. Say, “Those who fabricate lies about Allah
will not succeed.”
64.

70. Some enjoyment in this world; then to Us
is their return; then We will make them taste
the severe punishment on account of their disbelief.
71. And relate to them the story of Noah, when
he said to his people, “O my people, if my
presence among you and my reminding you
of Allah’s signs is too much for you, then in
Allah I have put my trust. So come to a deci-
sion, you and your partners, and do not let
the matter perplex you; then carry out your
decision on me, and do not hold back.”
72. “But if you turn away, I have not asked you
for any wage. My wage falls only on Allah,
and I was commanded to be of those who
submit.”
73. But they denounced him, so We saved him
and those with him in the Ark, and We made
them successors, and We drowned those who
rejected Our signs. So consider the fate of
those who were warned.
74. Then, after him, We sent messengers to
their people. They came to them with the
clear proofs, but they would not believe in an-
ything they had already rejected. Thus We set
a seal on the hearts of the hostile.
75. Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aa-
ron with Our proofs to Pharaoh and his dig-
nitaries. But they acted arrogantly. They were
sinful people.
76. And when the truth came to them from Us,
they said, “This is clearly sorcery.”
77. Moses said, “Is this what you say of the
truth when it has come to you? Is this sor-
cery? Sorcerers do not succeed.”
78. They said, “Did you come to us to divert us
from what we found our ancestors following,
and so that you become prominent in the
land? We will never believe in you.”
79. Pharaoh said, “Bring me every experienced
sorcerer.”
80. And when the sorcerers came, Moses said
to them, “Throw whatever you have to
throw.”
81. And when they threw, Moses said, “What
you produced is sorcery, and Allah will make
it fail. Allah does not foster the efforts of the
corrupt.”
82. “And Allah upholds the truth with His
words, even though the sinners detest it.”
83. But none believed in Moses except some
children of his people, for fear that Pharaoh
and his chiefs would persecute them. Phar-
aoh was high and mighty in the land. He was
a tyrant.
84. Moses said, “O my people, if you have be-
lieved in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if
you have submitted.”
85. They said, “In Allah we have put our trust.
Our Lord, do not make us victims of the op-
pressive people.”
86. “And deliver us, by Your mercy, from the
disbelieving people.”
87. And We inspired Moses and his brother,
“Settle your people in Egypt, and make your
homes places of worship, and perform the
prayer, and give good news to the believers.”
88. Moses said, “Our Lord, you have given
Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth
in the worldly life. Our Lord, for them to lead
away from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate
their wealth, and harden their hearts, they
will not believe until they see the painful tor-
ment.”
89. He said, “Your prayer has been answered,
so go straight, and do not follow the path of
those who do not know.”
90. And We delivered the Children of Israel
across the sea. Pharaoh and his troops pur-
sued them, defiantly and aggressively. Until,
when he was about to drown, he said, “I be-
lieve that there is no god except the One the
Children of Israel believe in, and I am of
those who submit.”
91. Now? When you have rebelled before, and
been of the mischief-makers?
92. Today We will preserve your body, so that
you become a sign for those after you. But
most people are heedless of Our signs. 

93. And We settled the Children of Israel in a
position of honor, and provided them with
good things. They did not differ until
knowledge came to them. Your Lord will
judge between them on the Day of Resurrec-
tion regarding their differences.
94. If you are in doubt about what We revealed
to you, ask those who read the Scripture be-
fore you. The truth has come to you from
your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt.
95. And do not be of those who deny Allah’s
revelations, lest you become one of the losers.
96. Those against whom your Lord’s Word is
justified will not believe.
97. Even if every sign comes to them—until
they see the painful punishment.
98. If only there was one town that believed
and benefited by its belief. Except for the peo-
ple of Jonah. When they believed, We re-
moved from them the suffering of disgrace in
the worldly life, and We gave them comfort
for a while.
99. Had your Lord willed, everyone on earth
would have believed. Will you compel people
to become believers?
100. No soul can believe except by Allah’s
leave; and He lays disgrace upon those who
refuse to understand.
101. Say, “Look at what is in the heavens and
the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no
avail for people who do not believe.
102. Do they expect anything but the likes of
the days of those who passed away before
them? Say, “Then wait, I will be waiting with
you.”
103. Then We save Our messengers and those
who believe. It is binding on Us to save the
believers.
104. Say, “O people, if you are in doubt about
my religion—I do not serve those you serve
apart from Allah. But I serve Allah, the one
who will terminate your lives. And I was
commanded to be of the believers.”
105. And dedicate yourself to the true reli-
gion—a monotheist—and never be of the
polytheists.
106. And do not call, apart from Allah, on what
neither benefits you nor harms you. If you
do, you are then one of the wrongdoers.
107. If Allah afflicts you with harm, none can
remove it except He. And if He wants good
for you, none can repel His grace. He makes
it reach whomever He wills of His servants.
He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
108. Say, “O people, the truth has come to you
from your Lord. Whoever accepts guidance is
guided for his own soul; and whoever strays
only strays to its detriment. I am not a guard-
ian over you.”
109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be
patient until Allah issues His judgment, for
He is the Best of judges.


11. HUD (Hud)

Alif, Lam, Ra. A Scripture whose Verses
were perfected, then elaborated, from One
who is Wise and Informed.
2. That you shall worship none but Allah. “I
am a warner to you from Him, and a bearer
of good news.”
3. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
pent to Him. He will provide you with good
sustenance until a stated term, and will be-
stow His grace on every possessor of virtue.
But if you turn away, then I fear for you the
punishment of a grievous Day.”
4. “To Allah is your return, and He is Capable
of all things.”
5. They wrap their chests to hide from Him.
But even as they cover themselves with their
clothes, He knows what they conceal and
what they reveal. He knows what lies within
the hearts.

6. There is no moving creature on earth but its
sustenance depends on Allah. And He knows
where it lives and where it rests. Everything is
in a Clear Book.

7. It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days—and His Throne was upon
the waters—in order to test you—which of you is best in conduct. And if you were to say,
“You will be resurrected after death,” those who disbelieve would say, “This is nothing
but plain witchcraft.”

8. And if We postponed their punishment un-
til a stated time, they would say, “What holds
it back?” On the Day when it reaches them, it
will not be averted from them, and what they
used to ridicule will besiege them.
9. If We give the human being a taste of mercy
from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he
becomes despairing and ungrateful.
10. And if We give him a taste of prosperity,
after some adversity has afflicted him, he will
say, “Troubles have gone away from me.” He
becomes excited and proud.
11. Except those who are patient and do good
deeds—these will have forgiveness and a
great reward.
12. Perhaps you wish to disregard some of
what is revealed to you, and you may be
stressed because of it, since they say, “If only
a treasure was sent down to him, or an angel
came with him.” You are only a warner, and
Allah is Responsible for all things.
13. Or do they say, “He invented it?” Say,
“Then produce ten chapters like it, invented,
and call upon whomever you can, besides Al-
lah, if you are truthful.”
14. But if they fail to answer you, know that it
was revealed with Allah’s knowledge, and
that there is no god but He. Will you then
submit?
15. Whoever desires the worldly life and its
glitter—We will fully recompense them for
their deeds therein, and therein they will not
be defrauded.
16. These—they will have nothing but the Fire
in the Hereafter. Their deeds are in vain
therein, and their works are null.
17. Is he who possesses a clear proof from his
Lord, recited by a witness from Him, and be-
fore it the Book of Moses, a guide and a
mercy? These believe in it. But whoever defies
it from among the various factions, the Fire is
his promise. So have no doubt about it. It is
the truth from your Lord, but most people do
not believe.
18. Who does greater wrong than he who fab-
ricates lies about Allah? These will be pre-
sented before their Lord, and the witnesses
will say, “These are they who lied about their
Lord.” Indeed, the curse of Allah is upon the
wrongdoers.
19. Those who hinder others from the path of
Allah, and seek to make it crooked; and re-
garding the Hereafter, they are in denial.
20. These will not escape on earth, and they
have no protectors besides Allah. The pun-
ishment will be doubled for them. They have
failed to hear, and they have failed to see.
21. Those are the ones who lost their souls, and
what they had invented has strayed away
from them.
22. Without a doubt, in the Hereafter, they will
be the biggest losers.
23. As for those who believe and do good
deeds, and humble themselves before their
Lord—these are the inhabitants of Paradise,
where they will abide forever.
24. The parable of the two groups is that of the
blind and the deaf, and the seeing and the
hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Will
you not reflect?
25. We sent Noah to his people, “I am to you a
clear warner.”
26. “That you shall worship none but Allah. I
fear for you the agony of a painful Day.”
27. The notables who disbelieved among his
people said, “We see in you nothing but a
man like us, and we see that only the worst among us have followed you, those of immature judgment. And we see that you have no
advantage over us. In fact, we think you are liars.”
28. He said, “O my people, Have you consid-
ered? If I stand on clear evidence from my
Lord, and He has given me a mercy from
Himself, but you were blind to it, can we
compel you to accept it, even though you dis-
like it?”
29. “O my people! I ask of you no money for it.
My reward lies only with Allah. And I am not
about to dismiss those who believed; they will
surely meet their Lord. And I see that you are
ignorant people.”
30. “O my people! Who will support me
against Allah, if I dismiss them? Will you not
give a thought?”
31. “I do not say to you that I possess the treas-
ures of Allah, nor do I know the future, nor
do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say of
those who are despicable in your eyes that Al-
lah will never give them any good. Allah is
Aware of what lies in their souls. If I did, I
would be one of the wrongdoers.”
32. They said, “O Noah, you have argued with
us, and argued a great deal. Now bring upon
us what you threaten us with, if you are truth-
ful.”
33. He said, “It is Allah who will bring it upon
you, if He wills, and you will not be able to
escape.”
34. “My advice will not benefit you, much as I
may want to advise you, if Allah desires to
confound you. He is your Lord, and to Him
you will be returned.”
35. Or do they say, “He made it up?” Say, “If I
made it up, upon me falls my crime, and I am
innocent of the crimes you commit.”
36. And it was revealed to Noah: “None of
your people will believe, except those who
have already believed, so do not grieve over
what they do.”
37. “And build the Ark, under Our eyes, and
with Our inspiration, and do not address Me
regarding those who did wrong; they are to
be drowned.”
38. As he was building the ark, whenever some
of his people passed by him, they ridiculed
him. He said, “If you ridicule us, we will ridi-
cule you, just as you ridicule.”
39. “You will surely know upon whom will
come a torment that will abase him, and upon
whom will fall a lasting torment.”
40. Until, when Our command came, and the
volcano erupted, We said, “Board into it a
pair of every kind, and your family—except
those against whom the sentence has already
been passed—and those who have believed.”
But those who believed with him were only a
few.
41. He said, “Embark in it. In the name of Al-
lah shall be its sailing and its anchorage. My
Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful.”
42. And so it sailed with them amidst waves
like hills. And Noah called to his son, who
had kept away, “O my son! Embark with us,
and do not be with the disbelievers.”
43. He said, “I will take refuge on a moun-
tain—it will protect me from the water.” He
said, “There is no protection from Allah’s de-
cree today, except for him on whom He has
mercy.” And the waves surged between them,
and he was among the drowned.
44. And it was said, “O earth, swallow your wa-
ters,” and “O heaven, clear up.” And the wa-
ters receded, and the event was concluded,
and it settled on Judi, and it was proclaimed:
“Away with the wicked people.”
45. And Noah called to his Lord. He said, “O
My Lord, my son is of my family, and Your
promise is true, and You are the Wisest of the
wise.”
46. He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family.
It is an unrighteous deed. So do not ask Me
about something you know nothing about. I
admonish you, lest you be one of the igno-
rant.”
47. He said, “O My Lord, I seek refuge with
You, from asking You about what I have no knowledge of. Unless You forgive me, and have mercy on me, I will be one of the losers.”

48. It was said, “O Noah, disembark with peace
from Us; and with blessings upon you, and
upon communities from those with you. And
other communities We will grant prosperity,
and then a painful torment from Us will be-
fall them.”
49. These are some stories from the past that
we reveal to you. Neither you, nor your peo-
ple knew them before this. So be patient. The
future belongs to the pious.
50. And to Aad, their brother Hud. He said, “O
my people, worship Allah, you have no other
god besides Him. You do nothing but invent
lies.”
51. “O my people, I ask you no wage for it; my
wage lies with Him who originated me. Do
you not understand?”
52. “O my people, ask forgiveness from your
Lord, and repent to Him. He will release the
sky pouring down upon you, and will add
strength to your strength. And do not turn
away and be wicked.”
53. They said, “O Hud, you did not bring us
any evidence, and we are not about to aban-
don our gods at your word, and we are not
believers in you.”
54. “We only say that some of our gods have
possessed you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah
to witness, and you to witness, that I am in-
nocent of what you associate.
55. Besides Him. So scheme against me, all of
you, and do not hesitate.
56. I have placed my trust in Allah, my Lord
and your Lord. There is not a creature but He
holds it by the forelock. My Lord is on a
straight path.
57. If you turn away, I have conveyed to you
what I was sent to you with; and my Lord will
replace you with another people, and you will
not cause Him any harm. My Lord is Guard-
ian over all things.”
58. And when Our decree came, We saved
Hud and those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, and We delivered them from
a harsh punishment.

59. That was Aad; they denied the signs of
their Lord, and defied His messengers, and
followed the lead of every stubborn tyrant.
60. And they were pursued by a curse in this
world, and on the Day of Resurrection. In-
deed, Aad blasphemed against their Lord—so
away with Aad, the people of Hud.
61. And to Thamood, their brother Saleh. He
said, “O my people, worship Allah, you have
no god other than Him. He initiated you
from the earth, and settled you in it. So seek
His forgiveness, and repent to Him. My Lord
is Near and Responsive.”
62. They said, “O Saleh, we had hopes in you
before this. Are you trying to prevent us from
worshiping what our parents worship? We
are in serious doubt regarding what you are
calling us to.”
63. He said, “O my people, have you consid-
ered? If I stand upon clear evidence from my
Lord, and He has given me mercy from Him,
who would protect me from Allah, if I diso-
beyed Him? You add nothing for me except
loss.”
64. “O my people, this is the she-camel of Al-
lah, a sign for you. Let her graze on Allah’s
land, and do not harm her, lest an imminent
punishment overtakes you.”
65. But they hamstrung her, and so He said,
“Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three
days. This is a prophecy that is infallible.”
66. Then, when Our command came, We
saved Saleh and those who believed with him,
by a mercy from Us, from the disgrace of that
day. Your Lord is the Strong, the Mighty.
67. And the Scream struck those who trans-
gressed, and they became motionless bodies
in their homes.
68. As if they had never prospered therein. In-
deed, Thamood rejected their Lord, so away
with Thamood.
69. Our messengers came to Abraham with
good news. They said, “Peace.” He said, 


strike them. Their appointed time is the
morning. Is not the morning near?”
82. And when Our command came about, We
turned it upside down, and We rained down
on it stones of baked clay.
83. Marked from your Lord, and never far
from the wrongdoers.
84. And to Median, their brother Shuaib. He
said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have
no god other than Him. And do not short
measure or short weight. I see you in good
circumstances, but I fear for you the agony of
an encompassing Day.”
85. “O my people! Give full measure and full
weight, in all fairness, and do not cheat the
people out of their rights, and do not spread
corruption in the land.
86. What is left by Allah is best for you, if you
are believers. And I am not a guardian over
you.”
87. They said, “O Shuaib, does your prayer
command you that we abandon what our an-
cestors worshiped, or doing with our wealth
what we want? You are the one who is intel-
ligent and wise.”
88. He said, “O my people, have you consid-
ered? What if I have clear evidence from my
Lord, and He has given me good livelihood
from Himself? I have no desire to do what I
forbid you from doing. I desire nothing but
reform, as far as I can. My success lies only
with Allah. In Him I trust, and to Him I
turn.”
89. “O my people, let not your hostility to-
wards me cause you to suffer what was suf-
fered by the people of Noah, or the people of
Hud, or the people of Saleh. The people of Lot
are not far away from you.”
90. “And ask your Lord for forgiveness, and re-
pent to Him. My Lord is Merciful and Lov-
ing.”
91. They said, “O Shuaib, we do not under-
stand much of what you say, and we see that
you are weak among us. Were it not for your

“Peace.” Soon after, he came with a roasted
calf.
70. But when he saw their hands not reaching
towards it, he became suspicious of them,
and conceived a fear of them. They said, “Do
not fear, we were sent to the people of Lot.”
71. His wife was standing by, so she laughed.
And We gave her good news of Isaac; and af-
ter Isaac, Jacob.
72. She said, “Alas for me. Shall I give birth,
when I am an old woman, and this, my hus-
band, is an old man? This is truly a strange
thing.”
73. They said, “Do you marvel at the decree of
Allah? The mercy and blessings of Allah are
upon you, O people of the house. He is
Praiseworthy and Glorious.”
74. When Abraham's fear subsided, and the
good news had reached him, he started plead-
ing with Us concerning the people of Lot.
75. Abraham was gentle, kind, penitent.
“O Abraham, refrain from this. The com-
mand of your Lord has come; they have in-
curred an irreversible punishment.”
77. And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was
anxious for them, and concerned for them.
He said, “This is a dreadful day.”
78. And his people came rushing towards
him—they were in the habit of committing
sins. He said, “O my people, these are my
daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Al-
lah, and do not embarrass me before my
guests. Is there not one reasonable man
among you?”
79. They said, “You know well that we have no
right to your daughters, and you know well
what we want.”
80. He said, “If only I had the strength to stop
you, or could rely on some strong support.”
81. They said, “O Lot, we are the envoys of
your Lord; they will not reach you. So set out
with your family during the cover of the
night, and let none of you look back, except
for your wife. She will be struck by what will
76.


tribe, we would have stoned you. You are of
no value to us.”
92. He said, “O my people, is my tribe more
important to you than Allah? And you have
turned your backs on Him? My Lord com-
prehends everything you do.”
93. “O my people, do as you may, and so will I.
You will know to whom will come a punish-
ment that will shame him, and who is a liar.
So look out; I am on the lookout with you.”
94. And when Our command came, We saved
Shuaib and those who believed with him, by
mercy from Us, and the Blast struck the
wrongdoers, and they became motionless
bodies in their homes.
95. As though they never flourished therein.
Away with Median, as was done away with
Thamood.
96. And We sent Moses with Our signs and a
clear mandate.
97. To Pharaoh and his nobles, but they fol-
lowed the command of Pharaoh, and the
command of Pharaoh was not wise.
98. He will precede his people on the Day of
Resurrection, and will lead them into the
Fire. Miserable is the place he placed them in.
99. They were followed by a curse in this, and
on the Day of Resurrection. Miserable is the
path they followed.
100. These are of the reports of the towns—We
relate them to you. Some are still standing,
and some have withered away.
101. We did not wrong them, but they wronged
themselves. Their gods, whom they invoked
besides Allah, availed them nothing when the
command of your Lord arrived. In fact, they
added only to their ruin.
102. Such is the grip of your Lord when He
seizes the towns in the midst of their sins. His
grip is most painful, most severe.
103. In that is a sign for whoever fears the pun-
ishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for
which humanity will be gathered together—
that is a Day to be witnessed.
104. We only postpone it until a predetermined
time.
On the Day when it arrives, no soul will
speak without His permission. Some will be
miserable, and some will be happy.
106. As for those who are miserable, they will
be in the Fire. They will have therein sighing
and wailing.
107. Remaining therein for as long as the heav-
ens and the earth endure, except as your Lord
wills. Your Lord is Doer of whatever He wills.
108. And as for those who are happy, they will
be in Paradise, remaining therein for as long
as the heavens and the earth endure, except
as your Lord wills—a reward without end.
109. So be not in doubt regarding what these
people worship. They worship only as their
ancestors worshiped before. We will pay
them their due in full, without any reduction.
110. We gave Moses the Scripture, but it was
disputed. Were it not for a prior word from
your Lord, it would have been settled be-
tween them. They are in serious doubt con-
cerning it.
111. Your Lord will repay each one of them in
full for their deeds. He is Aware of everything
they do.
112. So be upright, as you are commanded,
along with those who repented with you, and
do not transgress. He is Seeing of everything
you do.
113. And do not incline towards those who do
wrong, or the Fire may touch you; and you
will have no protectors besides Allah, and
you will not be saved.
114. Perform the prayer at the borders of the
day, and during the approaches of the night.
The good deeds take away the bad deeds. This
is a reminder for those who remember.
115. And be patient. Allah will not waste the re-
ward of the virtuous.
116. If only there were, among the generations
before you, people with wisdom, who spoke
against corruption on earth—except for the
few whom We saved. But the wrongdoers
105.
8312. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
pursued the luxuries they were indulged in,
and thus became guilty.
117. Your Lord would never destroy the towns
wrongfully, while their inhabitants are right-
eous.
118. Had your Lord willed, He could have
made humanity one community, but they
continue to differ.
119. Except those on whom your Lord has
mercy—for that reason He created them. The
Word of your Lord is final: “I will fill Hell
with jinn and humans, altogether.”
120. Everything We narrate to you of the his-
tory of the messengers is to strengthen your
heart therewith. The truth has come to you in
this, and a lesson, and a reminder for the be-
lievers.
121. And say to those who do not believe, “Act
according to your ability; and so will we.”
6. And thus your Lord will choose you, and
will teach you the interpretation of events,
and will complete His blessing upon you and
upon the family of Jacob, as He has com-
pleted it before upon your forefathers Abra-
ham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing and
Wise.
7. In Joseph and his brothers are lessons for
the seekers.
8. When they said, “Joseph and his brother are
dearer to our father than we are, although we
are a whole group. Our father is obviously in
the wrong.
9. “Kill Joseph, or throw him somewhere in
the land, and your father‘s attention will be
yours. Afterwards, you will be decent peo-
ple.”
10. One of them said, “Do not kill Joseph, but
throw him into the bottom of the well; some
caravan may pick him up—if you must do
something.”
11. They said, “Father, why do you not trust us
with Joseph, although we care for him?”
12. “Send him with us tomorrow, that he may
roam and play; we will take care of him.”
13. He said, “It worries me that you would take
him away. And I fear the wolf may eat him
while you are careless of him.”
14. They said, “If the wolf ate him, and we are
many, we would be good for nothing.”
15. So they went away with him, and agreed to
put him at the bottom of the well. And We
inspired him, “You will inform them of this
deed of theirs when they are unaware.”
16. And they came to their father in the even-
ing weeping.
17. They said, “O father, we went off racing
one another, and left Joseph by our belong-
ings; and the wolf ate him. But you will not
believe us, even though we are being truth-
ful.”
18. And they brought his shirt, with fake blood
on it. He said, “Your souls enticed you to do
something. But patience is beautiful, and Al-
lah is my Help against what you describe.”
122. “And
wait; we too are waiting.”
Allah belongs the future of the heavens
and the earth, and to Him all authority goes
back. So worship Him, and rely on Him.
Your Lord is never unaware of what you do.
123. To

(Yusuf)

1. Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the Verses of the
Clear Book.
2. We have revealed it an Arabic Quran, so
that you may understand.
3. We narrate to you the most accurate his-
tory, by revealing to you this Quran. Alt-
hough, prior to it, you were of the unaware.
4. When Joseph said to his father, “O my fa-
ther, I saw eleven planets, and the sun, and
the moon; I saw them bowing down to me.”
5. He said, “O my son, do not relate your vi-
sion to your brothers, lest they plot and
scheme against you. Satan is man's sworn en-
emy.
8412. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
A caravan passed by, and they sent their
water-carrier. He lowered his bucket, and
said, “Good news. Here is a boy.” And they
hid him as merchandise. But Allah was aware
of what they did.
20. And they sold him for a cheap price—a few
coins—they considered him to be of little
value.
21. The Egyptian who bought him said to his
wife, “Take good care of him; he may be use-
ful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” We
thus established Joseph in the land, to teach
him the interpretation of events. Allah has
control over His affairs, but most people do
not know.
22. When he reached his maturity, We gave
him wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward
the righteous.
23. She in whose house he was living tried to
seduce him. She shut the doors, and said, “I
am yours.” He said, “Allah forbid! He is my
Lord. He has given me a good home. Sinners
never succeed.”
24. She desired him, and he desired her, had he
not seen the proof of his Lord. It was thus that
We diverted evil and indecency away from
him. He was one of Our loyal servants.
25. As they raced towards the door, she tore his
shirt from behind. At the door, they ran into
her husband. She said, “What is the penalty
for him who desired to dishonor your wife,
except imprisonment or a painful punish-
ment?”
26. He said, “It was she who tried to seduce
me.” A witness from her household sug-
gested: “If his shirt is torn from the front:
then she has told the truth, and he is the liar.
27. But if his shirt is torn from the back: then
she has lied, and he is the truthful.”
28. And when he saw that his shirt was torn
from the back, he said, “This is a woman's
scheme. Your scheming is serious indeed.”
29. “Joseph, turn away from this. And you,
woman, ask forgiveness for your sin; you are
indeed in the wrong.”
Some ladies in the city said, “The gover-
nor's wife is trying to seduce her servant. She
is deeply in love with him. We see she has
gone astray.”
31. And when she heard of their gossip, she in-
vited them, and prepared for them a banquet,
and she gave each one of them a knife. She
said, “Come out before them.” And when
they saw him, they marveled at him, and cut
their hands. They said, “Good Allah, this is
not a human, this must be a precious angel.”
32. She said, “Here he is, the one you blamed
me for. I did try to seduce him, but he re-
sisted. But if he does not do what I tell him to
do, he will be imprisoned, and will be one of
the despised.”
33. He said, “My Lord, prison is more desira-
ble to me than what they call me to. Unless
You turn their scheming away from me, I
may yield to them, and become one of the ig-
norant.”
34. Thereupon his Lord answered him, and di-
verted their scheming away from him. He is
the Hearer, the Knower.
35. Then it occurred to them, after they had
seen the signs, to imprison him for a while.
36. Two youth entered the prison with him.
One of them said, “I see myself pressing
wine.” The other said, “I see myself carrying
bread on my head, from which the birds are
eating. Tell us their interpretation—we see
that you are one of the righteous.”
37. He said, “No food is served to you, but I
have informed you about it before you have
received it. That is some of what my Lord has
taught me. I have forsaken the tradition of
people who do not believe in Allah; and re-
garding the Hereafter, they are deniers.”
38. “And I have followed the faith of my fore-
fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is
not for us to associate anything with Allah.
This is by virtue of Allah’s grace upon us and
upon the people, but most people do not give
thanks.
39. “O My fellow inmates, are diverse lords
better, or Allah, the One, the Supreme?”
19.
30.
8512. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
40. “You do not worship, besides Him, except
names you have named, you and your ances-
tors, for which Allah has sent down no au-
thority. Judgment belongs to none but Allah.
He has commanded that you worship none
but Him. This is the right religion, but most
people do not know.
41. “O my fellow inmates! One of you will
serve his master wine; while the other will be
crucified, and the birds will eat from his head.
Thus the matter you are inquiring about is
settled.”
42. And he said to the one he thought would
be released, “Mention me to your master.”
But Satan caused him to forget mentioning
him to his master, so he remained in prison
for several years.
43. The king said, “I see seven fat cows being
eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green
spikes, and others dried up. O elders, explain
to me my vision, if you are able to interpret
visions.”
44. They said, “Jumbles of dreams, and we
know nothing of the interpretation of
dreams.”
45. The one who was released said, having re-
membered after a time, “I will inform you of
its interpretation, so send me out.”
46. “Joseph, O man of truth, inform us con-
cerning seven fat cows being eaten by seven
lean ones, and seven green spikes, and others
dried up, so that I may return to the people,
so that they may know.”
47. He said, “You will farm for seven consecu-
tive years. But whatever you harvest, leave it
in its spikes, except for the little that you eat.”
48. Then after that will come seven difficult
ones, which will consume what you have
stored for them, except for the little that you
have preserved.
49. Then after that will come a year that brings
relief to the people, and during which they
will press.
50. The king said, “Bring him to me.” And
when the envoy came to him, he said, “Go
back to your master, and ask him about the
intentions of the women who cut their hands;
my Lord is well aware of their schemes.”
51. He said, “What was the matter with you,
women, when you tried to seduce Joseph?”
They said, “Allah forbid! We knew of no evil
committed by him.” The governor’s wife then
said, “Now the truth is out. It was I who tried
to seduce him, and he is telling the truth.”
52. “This is that he may know that I did not
betray him in secret, and that Allah does not
guide the scheming of the betrayers.”
53. “Yet I do not claim to be innocent. The soul
commands evil, except those on whom my
Lord has mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgiving
and Merciful.”
54. The king said, “Bring him to me, and I will
reserve him for myself.” And when he spoke
to him, he said, “This day you are with us es-
tablished and secure.”
55. He said, “Put me in charge of the store-
houses of the land; I am honest and knowl-
edgeable.”
56. And thus We established Joseph in the
land, to live therein wherever he wished. We
touch with Our mercy whomever We will,
and We never waste the reward of the right-
eous.
57. But the reward of the Hereafter is better for
those who believe and observed piety.
58. And Joseph's brothers came, and entered
into his presence. He recognized them, but
they did not recognize him.
59. When he provided them with their provi-
sions, he said, “Bring me a brother of yours
from your father. Do you not see that I fill up
the measure, and I am the best of hosts?”
60. “But if you do not bring him to me, you will
have no measure from me, and you will not
come near me.”
61. They said, “We will solicit him from his fa-
ther. We will surely do.”
62. He said to his servants, “Put their goods in
their saddlebags; perhaps they will recognize
8612. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
them when they return to their families, and
maybe they will come back.”
63. When they returned to their father, they
said, “O father, we were denied measure, but
send our brother with us, and we will obtain
measure. We will take care of him.”
64. He said, “Shall I trust you with him, as I
trusted you with his brother before? Allah is
the Best Guardian, and He is the Most Mer-
ciful of the merciful.”
65. And when they opened their baggage, they
found that their goods were returned to
them. They said, “Father, what more do we
want? Here are our goods, returned to us. We
will provide for our family, and protect our
brother, and have an additional camel-load.
This is easy commerce.”
66. He said, “I will not send him with you, un-
less you give me a pledge before Allah that
you will bring him back to me, unless you get
trapped.” And when they gave him their
pledge, he said, “Allah is witness to what we
say.”
67. And he said, “O my sons, do not enter by
one gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot
avail you anything against Allah. The deci-
sion rests only with Allah. On Him I rely, and
on Him let the reliant rely.”
68. And when they entered as their father had
instructed them, it did not avail them any-
thing against Allah; it was just a need in the
soul of Jacob, which he carried out. He was a
person of knowledge inasmuch as We had
taught him, but most people do not know.
69. And when they entered into the presence
of Joseph, he embraced his brother, and said,
“I am your brother; do not be saddened by
what they used to do.”
70. Then, when he provided them with their
provisions, he placed the drinking-cup in his
brother’s saddlebag. Then an announcer
called out, “O people of the caravan, you are
thieves.”
71. They said, as they came towards them,
“What are you missing?”
72. They said, “We are missing the king’s gob-
let. Whoever brings it will have a camel-load;
and I personally guarantee it.”
73. They said, “By Allah, you know we did not
come to cause trouble in the land, and we are
not thieves.”
74. They said, “What shall be his punishment,
if you are lying?”
75. They said, “His punishment, if it is found
in his bag: he will belong to you. Thus we pe-
nalize the guilty.”
76. So he began with their bags, before his
brother's bag. Then he pulled it out of his
brother’s bag. Thus We devised a plan for Jo-
seph; he could not have detained his brother
under the king’s law, unless Allah so willed.
We elevate by degrees whomever We will;
and above every person of knowledge, there
is one more learned.
77. They said, “If he has stolen, a brother of his
has stolen before.” But Joseph kept it to him-
self, and did not reveal it to them. He said,
“You are in a worse situation, and Allah is
Aware of what you allege.”
78. They said, “O noble prince, he has a father,
a very old man, so take one of us in his place.
We see that you are a good person.”
79. He said, “Allah forbid that we should arrest
anyone except him in whose possession we
found our property; for then we would be un-
just.”
80. And when they despaired of him, they con-
ferred privately. Their eldest said, “Don’t you
know that your father received a pledge from
you before Allah, and in the past you failed
with regard to Joseph? I will not leave this
land until my father permits me, or Allah de-
cides for me; for He is the Best of Deciders.”
81. “Go back to your father, and say, ‘Our fa-
ther, your son has stolen. We testify only to
what we know, and we could not have pre-
vented the unforeseen.’”
82. “Ask the town where we were, and the car-
avan in which we came. We are being truth-
ful.”
8712. JOSEPH (Yusuf)
83. He said, “Rather, your souls have contrived
something for you. Patience is a virtue. Per-
haps Allah will bring them all back to me. He
is the Knowing, the Wise.”
84. Then he turned away from them, and said,
“O my bitterness for Joseph.” And his eyes
turned white from sorrow, and he became
depressed.
85. They said, “By Allah, you will not stop re-
membering Joseph, until you have ruined
your health, or you have passed away.”
86. He said, “I only complain of my grief and
sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what
you do not know.”
87. “O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph
and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's
comfort. None despairs of Allah's comfort
except the disbelieving people.”
88. Then, when they entered into his presence,
they said, “Mighty governor, adversity has
befallen us, and our family. We have brought
scant merchandise. But give us full measure,
and be charitable towards us—Allah rewards
the charitable.”
89. He said, “Do you realize what you did with
Joseph and his brother, in your ignorance?”
90. They said, “Is that you, Joseph?” He said, “I
am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has
been gracious to us. He who practices piety
and patience—Allah never fails to reward the
righteous.”
91. They said, “By Allah, Allah has preferred
you over us. We were definitely in the
wrong.”
92. He said, “There is no blame upon you to-
day. Allah will forgive you. He is the Most
Merciful of the merciful.”
93. “Take this shirt of mine, and lay it over my
father’s face, and he will recover his sight.
And bring your whole family to me.”
94. As the caravan set out, their father said, “I
sense the presence of Joseph, though you may
think I am senile.”
95. They said, “By Allah, you are still in your
old confusion.”
Then, when the bearer of good news ar-
rived, he laid it over his face, and he regained
his sight. He said, “Did I not say to you that I
know from Allah what you do not know?”
97. They said, “Father, pray for the forgiveness
of our sins; we were indeed at fault.”
98. He said, “I will ask my Lord to forgive you.
He is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.”
99. Then, when they entered into the presence
of Joseph, he embraced his parents, and said,
“Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe and secure.”
100. And he elevated his parents on the throne,
and they fell prostrate before him. He said,
“Father, this is the fulfillment of my vision of
long ago. My Lord has made it come true. He
has blessed me, when he released me from
prison, and brought you out of the wilder-
ness, after the devil had sown conflict be-
tween me and my brothers. My Lord is Most
Kind towards whomever He wills. He is the
All-knowing, the Most Wise.”
101. “My Lord, You have given me some au-
thority, and taught me some interpretation of
events. Initiator of the heavens and the earth;
You are my Protector in this life and in the
Hereafter. Receive my soul in submission,
and unite me with the righteous.”
102. This is news from the past that We reveal
to you. You were not present with them when
they plotted and agreed on a plan.
103. But most people, for all your eagerness, are
not believers.
104. You ask them no wage for it. It is only a
reminder for all mankind.
105. How many a sign in the heavens and the
earth do they pass by, paying no attention to
them?
106. And most of them do not believe in Allah
unless they associate others.
107. Do they feel secure that a covering of Al-
lah’s punishment will not come upon them,
or that the Hour will not come upon them
suddenly, while they are unaware?
108. Say, “This is my way; I invite to Allah,
based on clear knowledge—I and whoever

8813. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)
better than others. In that are proofs for peo-
ple who reason.
5. Should you wonder—the real wonder is
their saying: “When we have become dust,
will we be in a new creation?” Those are they
who defied their Lord. Those are they who
will have yokes around their necks. Those are
the inhabitants of the Fire, where they will re-
main forever.
6. And they urge you to hasten evil before
good, though examples have passed away be-
fore them. Your Lord is full of forgiveness to-
wards the people for their wrongdoings, yet
your Lord is severe in retribution.
7. Those who disbelieve say, “Why was a mir-
acle not sent down to him from his Lord?”
You are only a warner, and to every commu-
nity is a guide.
8. Allah knows what every female bears, and
every increase and decrease of the wombs.
With Him, everything is by measure.
9. The Knower of the Invisible and the Visible;
the Grand, the Supreme.
10. It is the same; whether one of you conceals
his speech, or declares it; whether he goes
into hiding by night, or goes out by day.
11. He has a succession; before him and behind
him, protecting him by Allah’s command.
Allah does not change the condition of a peo-
ple until they change what is within them-
selves. And if Allah wills any hardship for a
people, there is no turning it back; and apart
from Him they have no protector.
12. It is He who shows you the lightening,
causing fear and hope. And He produces the
heavy clouds.
13. The thunder praises His glory, and so do
the angels, in awe of Him. And He sends the
thunderbolts, striking with them whomever
He wills. Yet they argue about Allah, while
He is Tremendous in might.
14. To Him belongs the call to truth. Those
they call upon besides Him do not respond to
them with anything—except as someone who
stretches his hands towards water, so that it
follows me. Glory be to Allah; and I am not
of the polytheists.”
109. We did not send before you except men,
whom We inspired, from the people of the
towns. Have they not roamed the earth and
seen the consequences for those before them?
The Home of the Hereafter is better for those
who are righteous. Do you not understand?
110. Until, when the messengers have des-
paired, and thought that they were rejected,
Our help came to them. We save whomever
We will, and Our severity is not averted from
the guilty people.
111. In their stories is a lesson for those who
possess intelligence. This is not a fabricated
tale, but a confirmation of what came before
it, and a detailed explanation of all things,
and guidance, and mercy for people who be-
lieve.
13. THUNDER
(ar-Ra’d)

1. Alif,
Lam, Meem, Ra. These are the signs of
the Scripture. What is revealed to you from
your Lord is the truth, but most people do not
believe.
2. Allah is He who raised the heavens without
pillars that you can see, and then settled on
the Throne. And He regulated the sun and
the moon, each running for a specified pe-
riod. He manages all affairs, and He explains
the signs, that you may be certain of the meet-
ing with your Lord.
3. And it is He who spread the earth, and
placed in it mountains and rivers. And He
placed in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes
the night to overlap the day. In that are signs
for people who reflect.
4. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens
of vines, and crops, and date-palms, from the
same root or from distinct roots, irrigated
with the same water. We make some taste
8913. THUNDER (ar-Ra’d)
openly, and repel evil with good. These will
have the Ultimate Home.
23. Everlasting Gardens, which they will enter,
along with the righteous among their par-
ents, and their spouses, and their descend-
ants. And the angels will enter upon them
from every gate.
24. “Peace be upon you, because you endured
patiently. How excellent is the Final Home.”
25. As for those who violate the promise to Al-
lah, after pledging to keep it, and sever what
Allah has commanded to be joined, and
spread corruption on earth—these, the curse
will be upon them, and they will have the
Worst Home.
26. Allah dispenses the provisions to whom-
ever He wills, and restricts. And they delight
in the worldly life; yet the worldly life, com-
pared to the Hereafter, is only enjoyment.
27. Those who disbelieve say, “If only a miracle
was sent down to him from his Lord.” Say,
“Allah leads astray whomever He wills, and
He guides to Himself whoever repents.”
28. Those who believe, and whose hearts find
comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely,
it is in the remembrance of Allah that hearts
find comfort.”
29. For those who believe and do righteous
deeds—for them is happiness and a beautiful
return.
30. Thus We sent you among a community be-
fore which other communities have passed
away, that you may recite to them what We
revealed to you. Yet they deny the Benevolent
One. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god but
He; in Him I trust, and to Him is my repent-
ance.”
31. Even if there were a Quran, by which
mountains could be set in motion, or by
which the earth could be shattered, or by
which the dead could be made to speak. In
fact, every decision rests with Allah. Did the
believers not give up and realize that had Al-
lah willed, He would have guided all human-
ity? Disasters will continue to strike those
who disbelieve, because of their deeds, or
may reach his mouth, but it does not reach it.
The prayers of the unbelievers are only in
vain.
15. To Allah prostrates everyone in the heav-
ens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as
do their shadows, in the morning and in the
evening.
16. Say, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and
the earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you taken
besides Him protectors, who have no power
to profit or harm even themselves?” Say, “Are
the blind and the seeing equal? Or are dark-
ness and light equal? Or have they assigned to
Allah associates, who created the likes of His
creation, so that the creations seemed to
them alike? Say, “Allah is the Creator of all
things, and He is The One, the Irresistible.”
17. He sends down water from the sky, and riv-
erbeds flow according to their capacity. The
current carries swelling froth. And from what
they heat in fire of ornaments or utensils
comes a similar froth. Thus Allah exemplifies
truth and falsehood. As for the froth, it is
swept away, but what benefits the people re-
mains in the ground. Thus Allah presents the
analogies.
18. For those who respond to their Lord is the
best. But as for those who do not respond to
Him, even if they possessed everything on
earth, and twice as much, they could not re-
deem themselves with it. Those will have the
worst reckoning; and their home is Hell—a
miserable destination.
19. Is he who knows that what was revealed to
your from your Lord is the truth, like him
who is blind? Only those who reason will re-
member.
20. Those who fulfill the promise to Allah, and
do not violate the agreement.
21. And those who join what Allah has com-
manded to be joined, and fear their Lord, and
dread the dire reckoning.
22. And those who patiently seek the presence
of their Lord, and pray regularly, and spend
from Our provisions to them, secretly and
9014. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
they fall near their homes, until Allah’s
promise comes true. Allah never breaks a
promise.
32. Messengers before you were ridiculed, but
I granted the disbelievers respite, and then I
seized them. What a punishment it was!
33. Is He who is watchful over the deeds of
every soul? Yet they ascribe associates to Al-
lah. Say, “Name them! Or are you informing
Him of something on earth He does not
know, or is it a show of words?” In fact, the
scheming of those who disbelieve is made to
appear good to them, and they are averted
from the path. Whomever Allah misguides
has no guide.
34. There is for them torment in the worldly
life, but the torment of the Hereafter is
harsher. And they have no defender against
Allah.
35. The likeness of the Garden promised to the
righteous: rivers flowing beneath it; its food
is perpetual, and so is its shade. Such is the
sequel for those who guard against evil, but
the sequel of the disbelievers is the Fire.
36. Those to whom We gave the Scripture re-
joice in what was revealed to you, while some
factions reject parts of it. Say, “I am com-
manded to worship Allah, and to never asso-
ciate anything with Him. To Him I invite,
and to Him is my return.”
37. Thus We revealed it an Arabic code of law.
Were you to follow their desires, after the
knowledge that has come to you, you would
have neither ally nor defender against Allah.
38. We sent messengers before you, and We
assigned for them wives and offspring. No
messenger could bring a sign except with the
permission of Allah. For every era is a scrip-
ture.
39. Allah abolishes whatever He wills, and He
affirms. With Him is the source of the Scrip-
ture.
40. Whether We show you some of what We
have promised them, or We cause you to
die—your duty is to inform, and Ours is the
reckoning.
Do they not see how We deal with the
earth, diminishing it at its edges? Allah
judges; and nothing can hold back His judg-
ment. And He is quick to settle accounts.
42. Those before them planned, but the entire
plan is up to Allah. He knows what every soul
earns. Those who disbelieve will know to
whom the Ultimate Home is.
43. Those who disbelieve say, “You are not a
messenger.” Say, “Allah is a sufficient witness
between me and you, and whoever has
knowledge of the Scripture.”
41.
14. ABRAHAM
(Ibrahim)

1. Alif,
Lam, Ra. A Scripture that We revealed
to you, that you may bring humanity from
darkness to light—with the permission of
their Lord—to the path of the Almighty, the
Praiseworthy.
2. Allah—to whom belongs what is in the
heavens and the earth. And woe to the disbe-
lievers from a severe torment.
3. Those who prefer the present life to the
Hereafter, and repel from the path of Allah,
and seek to make it crooked—these are far
astray.
4. We never sent any messenger except in the
language of his people, to make things clear
for them. Allah leads astray whom He wills,
and guides whom He wills. He is the Mighty,
the Wise.
5. We sent Moses with Our signs: “Bring your
people out of darkness into light, and remind
them of the Days of Allah.” In that are signs
for every patient and thankful person.”
6. Moses said to his people, “Remember Al-
lah’s blessings upon you, as He delivered you
from the people of Pharaoh, who inflicted on
you terrible suffering, slaughtering your sons
while sparing your daughters. In that was a
serious trial from your Lord.”
9114. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
7. And when your Lord proclaimed: “If you
give thanks, I will grant you increase; but if
you are ungrateful, My punishment is se-
vere.”
8. And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrate-
ful, together with everyone on earth—Allah is
in no need, Worthy of Praise.”
9. Has not the story reached you, of those be-
fore you, the people of Noah, and Aad, and
Thamood—and those after them? None
knows them except Allah. Their messengers
came to them with the clear proofs, but they
tried to silence them, and said, “We reject
what you are sent with, and we are in serious
doubt regarding what you are calling us to.”
10. Their messengers said, “Is there any doubt
about Allah, Maker of the heavens and the
earth? He calls you to forgive you your sins,
and to defer you until a stated term.” They
said, “You are only humans like us; you want
to turn us away from what our ancestors wor-
shiped; so bring us a clear proof.”
11. Their messengers said to them, “We are
only humans like you, but Allah favors
whomever He wills from among His servants.
We cannot possibly show you any proof, ex-
cept by leave of Allah. In Allah let the faithful
put their trust.”
12. “And why should we not trust in Allah,
when He has guided us in our ways? We will
persevere in the face of your persecution.
And upon Allah the reliant should rely.”
13. Those who disbelieved said to their mes-
sengers, “We will expel you from our land,
unless you return to our religion.” And their
Lord inspired them: “We will destroy the
wrongdoers.”
14. “And We will settle you in the land after
them. That is for him who fears My Majesty,
and fears My threats.”
15. And they prayed for victory, and every
stubborn tyrant came to disappointment.
16. Beyond him lies Hell, and he will be given
to drink putrid water.
17. He will guzzle it, but he will not swallow it.
Death will come at him from every direction,
but he will not die. And beyond this is relent-
less suffering.
18. The likeness of those who disbelieve in
their Lord: their works are like ashes, in a
fierce wind, on a stormy day. They have no
control over anything they have earned. That
is the utmost misguidance.
19. Do you not see that Allah created the heav-
ens and the earth with truth? If He wills, He
can do away with you, and bring a new crea-
tion.
20. And
that is not difficult for Allah.
They will emerge before Allah, altogether.
The weak will say to those who were proud,
“We were your followers, can you protect us
at all against Allah’s punishment?” They will
say, “Had Allah guided us, we would have
guided you. It is the same for us; whether we
mourn, or are patient; there is no asylum for
us.”
22. And Satan will say, when the issue is set-
tled, “Allah has promised you the promise of
truth, and I promised you, but I failed you. I
had no authority over you, except that I called
you, and you answered me. So do not blame
me, but blame yourselves. I cannot come to
your aid, nor can you come to my aid. I reject
your associating with me in the past. The
wrongdoers will have a torment most pain-
ful.”
23. But those who believed and did good deeds
will be admitted into gardens beneath which
rivers flow, to remain therein forever, by
leave of their Lord. Their greeting therein will
be: “Peace.”
24. Do you not see how Allah presents a para-
ble? A good word is like a good tree—its root
is firm, and its branches are in the sky.
25. It yields its fruits every season by the will of
its Lord. Allah presents the parables to the
people, so that they may reflect.
26. And the parable of a bad word is that of a
bad tree—it is uprooted from the ground; it
has no stability.
21.
9214. ABRAHAM (Ibrahim)
some people incline towards them, and pro-
vide them with fruits, that they may be thank-
ful.”
38. “Our Lord, You know what we conceal and
what we reveal. And nothing is hidden from
Allah, on earth or in the heaven.”
39. “Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in
my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. My Lord is the
Hearer of Prayers.”
40. “My Lord, make me one who performs the
prayer, and from my offspring. Our Lord, ac-
cept my supplication.”
41. “Our Lord, forgive me, and my parents,
and the believers, on the Day the Reckoning
takes place.”
42. Do not ever think that Allah is unaware of
what the wrongdoers do. He only defers them
until a Day when the sights stare.
43. Their necks outstretched, their heads up-
raised, their gaze unblinking, their hearts
void.
44. And warn mankind of the Day when the
punishment will come upon them, and the
wicked will say, “Our Lord, defer us for a little
while, and we will answer Your call and fol-
low the messengers.” Did you not swear be-
fore that there will be no passing away for
you?
45. And you inhabited the homes of those who
wronged themselves, and it became clear to
you how We dealt with them, and We cited
for you the examples.
46. They planned their plans, but their plans
are known to Allah, even if their plans can
eliminate mountains.
47. Do not ever think that Allah will break His
promise to His messengers. Allah is Strong,
Able to Avenge.
48. On the Day when the earth is changed into
another earth, and the heavens, and they will
emerge before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.
49. On that Day, you will see the sinners bound
together in chains.
27. Allah gives firmness to those who believe,
with the firm word, in this life, and in the
Hereafter. And Allah leads the wicked astray.
Allah does whatever He wills.
28. Have you not seen those who exchanged
the blessing of Allah with blasphemy, and
landed their people into the house of perdi-
tion?
29. Hell—they will roast in it. What a misera-
ble settlement.
30. And they set up rivals to Allah, in order to
lead away from His path. Say, “Enjoy your-
selves; your destination is the Fire.”
31. Tell My servants who have believed to per-
form the prayers, and to give from what We
have given them, secretly and publicly, before
a Day comes in which there is neither trading
nor friendship.
32. Allah is He Who created the heavens and
the earth, and sends down water from the
sky, and with it produces fruits for your sus-
tenance. And He committed the ships to your
service, sailing through the sea by His com-
mand, and He committed the rivers to your
service.
33. And He committed the sun and the moon
to your service, both continuously pursuing
their courses, and He committed the night
and the day to your service.
34. And He has given you something of all
what you asked. And if you were to count Al-
lah’s blessings, you would not be able to enu-
merate them. The human being is unfair and
ungrateful.
35. Recall that Abraham said, “O my Lord,
make this land peaceful, and keep me and my
sons from worshiping idols.”
36. “My Lord, they have led many people
astray. Whoever follows me belongs with me;
and whoever disobeys me—You are Forgiv-
ing and Merciful.
37. “Our Lord, I have settled some of my off-
spring in a valley of no vegetation, by Your
Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may
perform the prayers. So make the hearts of

Their garments made of tar, and the Fire
covering their faces.
51. That Allah may repay each soul according
to what it has earned. Allah is Quick in reck-
oning.
52. This is a proclamation for mankind, that
they may be warned thereby, and know that
He is One God, and that people of under-
standing may remember.
15. They
would still say, “Our eyes are halluci-
nating; in fact, we are people bewitched.”
16. We placed constellations in the sky, and
made them beautiful to the beholders.
17. And We guarded them from every outcast
devil.
18. Except one who steals a hearing, and is fol-
lowed by a visible projectile.
19. We spread the earth, and placed stabilizers
in it, and in it We grew all things in proper
measure.
20. And in it We created livelihoods for you,
and for those for whom you are not the pro-
viders.
21. There is not a thing but with Us are its
stores, and We send it down only in precise
measure.
22. We send the fertilizing winds; and send
down water from the sky, and give it to you
to drink, and you are not the ones who store
it.
23. It is We who give life and cause death, and
We are the Inheritors.
24. And We know those of you who go for-
ward, and We know those who lag behind.
25. It is your Lord who will gather them to-
gether. He is the Wise, the Knowing.
26. We created the human being from clay,
from molded mud.
27. And the jinn We created before, from
piercing fire.
28. Your Lord said to the angels, “I am creating
a human being from clay, from molded
mud.”
29. “When I have formed him, and breathed
into him of My spirit, fall down prostrating
before him.”
30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all to-
gether.
31. Except for Satan. He refused to be among
those who prostrated themselves.
50.

2. Perhaps those who disbelieve would like to

3. Leave them to eat, and enjoy, and be lulled

4. We have never destroyed a town unless it

5. No nation can bring its time forward, nor
can they delay it.
6. And they said, “O you who received the
message, you are insane.”
7. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you
are truthful?”
8. We do not send the angels down except
with reason, and they will not be held back.
9. Surely We revealed the Message, and We
will surely preserve it.
10. We sent others before you, to the former
communities.
11. But no messenger came to them, but they
ridiculed him.

34. He said, “Then get out of here, for you are
an outcast”.

said, “Do not fear; we bring you good

54. He said, “Do you bring me good news,

news do you bring?”
55. They said, “We bring you good news in
truth, so do not despair.”
56. He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s
mercy but the lost?”
57. He said, “So what is your business, O en-
voys?”
58. They said, “We were sent to a sinful peo-
ple.”

60. “Except for his wife.” We have determined
that she will be of those who lag behind.

ful.”

none of you look back, and proceed as com-

turned away from them.

16. THE BEE
(an-Nahl)

1. The
command of Allah has come, so do not
rush it. Glory be to Him; exalted above what
they associate.
2. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by
His command, upon whom He wills of His
servants: “Give warning that there is no god
but Me, and fear Me.”
3. He created the heavens and the earth with
justice. He is exalted above the associations
they attribute.
4. He created the human being from a drop of
fluid, yet he becomes an open adversary.
5. And the livestock—He created them for
you. In them are warmth and benefits for
you, and of them you eat.
6. And there is beauty in them for you, when
you bring them home, and when you drive
them to pasture.
7. And they carry your loads to territory you
could not have reached without great hard-
ship. Your Lord is Clement and Merciful.
8. And the horses, and the mules, and the don-
keys—for you to ride, and for luxury. And He
creates what you do not know.
9. It is for Allah to point out the paths, but
some of them are flawed. Had He willed, He
could have guided you all.
83. But
the Blast struck them in the morning.
All they had acquired was of no avail to
them.

10. It is He Who sends down for you from the
sky water. From it is drink, and with it grows
vegetation for grazing.
11. And He produces for you grains with it,
and olives, and date-palms, and grapes, and
all kinds of fruits. Surely in that is a sign for
people who think.
12. And He regulated for you the night and the
day; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars
are disposed by His command. Surely in that
are signs for people who ponder.
13. And whatsoever He created for you on
earth is of diverse colors. Surely in that is a
sign for people who are mindful.
14. And it is He who made the sea to serve you,
that you may eat from it tender meat, and ex-
tract from it ornaments that you wear. And
you see the ships plowing through it, as you
seek His bounties, so that you may give
thanks.
15. And he cast mountains on the earth, lest it
shifts with you; and rivers, and roads, so that
you may be guided.
16. And landmarks. And by the stars they
guide themselves.
17. Is He who creates like him who does not
create? Will you not take a lesson?
18. And if you tried to enumerate the favors of
Allah, you will not be able to count them. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
19. And Allah knows what you hide and what
you disclose.
20. Those they invoke besides Allah create
nothing, but are themselves created.
21. They are dead, not alive; and they do not
know when they will be resurrected.
22. Your God is one God. As for those who do
not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are
in denial, and they are arrogant.
23. Without a doubt, Allah knows what they
conceal and what they reveal. He does not
like the arrogant.
And when it is said to them, “What has
your Lord sent down?” They say, “Legends of
the ancients.”
25. So let them carry their loads complete on
the Day of Resurrection, and some of the
loads of those they misguided without
knowledge. Evil is what they carry.
26. Those before them also schemed, but Allah
took their structures from the foundations,
and the roof caved in on them. The punish-
ment came at them from where they did not
perceive.
27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will
disgrace them, and say, “Where are My asso-
ciates for whose sake you used to dispute?”
Those who were given knowledge will say,
“Today shame and misery are upon the dis-
believers.”
28. Those wronging their souls while the an-
gels are taking them away—they will propose
peace: “We did no wrong.” Yes you did. Allah
is aware of what you used to do.”
29. Enter the gates of Hell, to dwell therein for-
ever. Miserable is the residence of the arro-
gant.
30. And it will be said to those who maintained
piety, “What has your Lord revealed?” They
will say, “Goodness.” To those who do good
in this world is goodness, and the Home of
the Hereafter is even better. How wonderful
is the residence of the pious.
31. The Gardens of Perpetuity, which they will
enter, beneath which rivers flow, where they
will have whatever they desire. Thus Allah re-
wards the pious.
32. Those who are in a wholesome state when
the angels take them—will say, “Peace be
upon you; enter Paradise, for what you used
to do.”
33. Are they but waiting for the angels to come
to them, or for the command of your Lord to
arrive? Those before them did likewise. Allah
did not wrong them, but they used to wrong
their own souls.
24.
9716. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
So the evils of their deeds assailed them,
and what they used to ridicule engulfed them.
35. The idolaters say, “Had Allah willed, we
would not have worshiped anything besides
Him, neither us, nor our ancestors, nor
would we have prohibited anything besides
His prohibitions.” Those before them did
likewise. Are the messengers responsible for
anything but clear communication?
36. To every community We sent a messenger:
“Worship Allah, and avoid idolatry.” Some of
them Allah guided, while others deserved
misguidance. So travel through the earth, and
see what the fate of the deniers was.
37. Even though you may be concerned about
their guidance, Allah does not guide those
who misguide. And they will have no saviors.
38. And they swear by Allah with their most
solemn oaths, “Allah will not resurrect any-
one who dies.” Yes indeed, it is a promise
binding on Him, but most people do not
know.
39. To clarify for them what they differed
about, and for the faithless to know that they
were liars.
40. When We intend for something to happen,
We say to it, “Be,” and it becomes.
41. Those who emigrate for Allah’s sake after
being persecuted, We will settle them in a
good place in this world; but the reward of
the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.
42. Those who endure patiently, and in their
Lord they put their trust.
43. We did not send before you except men
whom We inspired. So ask the people of
knowledge, if you do not know.
44. With the clarifications and the scriptures.
And We revealed to you the Reminder, that
you may clarify to the people what was re-
vealed to them, and that they may reflect.
45. Do those who scheme evils feel secure that
Allah will not cause the earth to cave in with
them, or that the punishment will not come
upon them from where they do not perceive?
46. Or that He will not seize them during their
activities? And they will not be able to pre-
vent it.
47. Or that He will not seize them while in
dread? Your Lord is Gentle and Merciful.
48. Have they not observed what Allah has cre-
ated? Their shadows revolve from the right
and the left, bowing to Allah as they shrink
away.
49. To Allah bows down everything in the
heavens and everything on earth—every liv-
ing creature, and the angels, and without be-
ing proud.
50. They fear their Lord above them, and they
do what they are commanded.
51. Allah has said: “Do not take two gods; He
is only One God; so fear only Me.”
52. To Him belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth; and to Him obedience is due
always. Do you, then, fear anyone other than
Allah?
53. Whatever blessing you have is from Allah.
And when harm touches you, it is to Him that
you groan.
54. But when He lifts the harm from you, some
of you associate others with their Lord.
55. To show ingratitude for what We have
given them. Enjoy yourselves. You will soon
know.
56. And they allocate, to something they do
not know, a share of what We have provided
for them. By Allah, you will be questioned
about what you have been inventing.
57. And they attribute to Allah daughters—ex-
alted is He—and for themselves what they de-
sire.
58. And when one of them is given news of a
female infant, his face darkens, and he chokes
with grief.
59. He hides from the people because of the
bad news given to him. Shall he keep it in hu-
miliation, or bury it in the dust? Evil is the
decision they make.
34.
9816. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
after having acquired knowledge. Allah is
Omniscient and Omnipotent.
71. Allah has favored some of you over others
in livelihood. Those who are favored would
not give their properties to their servants, to
the extent of making them partners in it. Will
they then renounce Allah’s blessings?
72. Allah has given you mates from among
yourselves; and has produced for you, from
your mates, children and grandchildren; and
has provided you with good things. Will they
then believe in falsehood, and refuse Allah’s
favors?
73. And yet they serve besides Allah what pos-
sesses no provisions for them in the heavens,
nor on earth, nor are they capable.
74. So do not cite the examples for Allah. Allah
knows, and you do not know.
75. Allah cites the example of a bonded slave,
who has no power over anything; and some-
one to whom We have given plentiful provi-
sion, from which he gives secretly and
openly. Are they equal in comparison? All
praise belongs to Allah, but most of them do
not know.
76. And Allah cites the example of two men:
one of them dumb, unable to do anything,
and is a burden on his master; whichever way
he directs him, he achieves nothing good. Is
he equal to him who commands justice, and
is on a straight path?
77. To Allah belongs the unseen of the heavens
and the earth. The coming of the Hour is only
as the twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Al-
lah has power over everything.
78. Allah brought you out of your mothers’
wombs, not knowing anything; and He gave
you the hearing, and the eyesight, and the
brains; that you may give thanks.
79. Have they not seen the birds, flying in the
midst of the sky? None sustains them except
Allah. In this are signs for people who believe.
80. And Allah has given you in your homes
habitats for you, and has provided for you out
of the hides of livestock portable homes for
60. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
set a bad example, while Allah sets the High-
est Example. He is the Mighty, the Wise.
61. If Allah were to hold mankind for their in-
justices, He would not leave upon it a single
creature, but He postpones them until an ap-
pointed time. Then, when their time arrives,
they will not delay it by one hour, nor will
they advance it.
62. And they attribute to Allah what they
themselves dislike, while their tongues utter
the lie that theirs is the goodness. Without a
doubt, for them is the Fire, and they will be
neglected.
63. By Allah, We sent messengers to commu-
nities before you, but Satan made their deeds
appear alluring to them. He is their master
today, and they will have a painful punish-
ment.
64. We revealed to you the Scripture only to
clarify for them what they differ about, and
guidance and mercy for people who believe.
65. Allah sends down water from the sky, with
which He revives the earth after its death. In
this is a sign for people who listen.
66. And there is a lesson for you in cattle: We
give you a drink from their bellies, from be-
tween waste and blood, pure milk, refreshing
to the drinkers.
67. And from the fruits of date-palms and
grapevines, you derive sugar and wholesome
food. In this is a sign for people who under-
stand.
68. And your Lord inspired the bee: “Set up
hives in the mountains, and in the trees, and
in what they construct.”
69. Then eat of all the fruits, and go along the
pathways of your Lord, with precision. From
their bellies emerges a fluid of diverse colors,
containing healing for the people. Surely in
this is a sign for people who reflect.
70. Allah created you; then He takes you away.
Some of you will be brought back to the worst
age, so that he will no longer know anything,
9916. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
you, so you can use them when you travel,
and when you camp; and from their wool,
and fur, and hair, furnishings and comfort
for a while.
81. And Allah has made for you shade out of
what He has created, and has given you re-
sorts in the mountains, and has given you
garments to protect you from the heat, and
garments to protect you from your violence.
Thus He completes His blessings upon you,
so that you may submit.
82. But if they turn away, your only duty is
clear communication.
83. They recognize Allah’s blessing, but then
deny it, as most of them are ungrateful.
84. On the Day when We raise up a witness
from every community—those who disbe-
lieved will not be permitted, nor will they be
excused.
85. When those who did wrong see the pun-
ishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor
will they be reprieved.
86. And when the idolaters see their associates,
they will say, “Our Lord, these are our associ-
ates whom we used to invoke besides You.”
They will strike back at them with the saying,
“Surely you are liars.”
87. On that Day they will offer their submis-
sion to Allah, and what they had invented will
abandon them.
88. Those who disbelieve and obstruct from
Allah’s path—We will add punishment to
their punishment, on account of the mischief
they used to make.
89. On the Day when We raise in every com-
munity a witness against them, from among
them, and bring you as a witness against
these. We have revealed to you the Book, as
an explanation of all things, and guidance,
and mercy and good news for those who sub-
mit.
90. Allah commands justice, and goodness,
and generosity towards relatives. And He for-
bids immorality, and injustice, and oppres-
sion. He advises you, so that you may take
heed.
91. Fulfill Allah’s covenant when you make a
covenant, and do not break your oaths after
ratifying them. You have made Allah your
guarantor, and Allah knows what you do.
92. And do not be like her who unravels her
yarn, breaking it into pieces, after she has
spun it strongly. Nor use your oaths as means
of deception among you, because one com-
munity is more prosperous than another. Al-
lah is testing you thereby. On the Day of Res-
urrection, He will make clear to you every-
thing you had disputed about.
93. Had Allah willed, He would have made you
one congregation, but He leaves astray whom
He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And
you will surely be questioned about what you
used to do.
94. And do not use your oaths to deceive one
another, so that a foot may not slip after being
firm, and you taste misery because you hin-
dered from Allah’s path, and incur a terrible
torment.
95. And do not exchange Allah’s covenant for
a small price. What is with Allah is better for
you, if you only knew.
96. What you have runs out, but what is with
Allah remains. We will reward those who are
patient according to the best of their deeds.
97. Whoever works righteousness, whether
male or female, while being a believer, We
will grant him a good life—and We will re-
ward them according to the best of what they
used to do.
98. When you read the Quran, seek refuge
with Allah from Satan the outcast.
99. He has no authority over those who believe
and trust in their Lord.
100. His authority is only over those who fol-
low him, and those who associate others with
Him.
101. When We substitute a verse in place of an-
other verse—and Allah knows best what He
10016. THE BEE (an-Nahl)
reveals—they say, “You are an impostor.” But
most of them do not know.
102. Say, “The Holy Spirit has brought it down
from your Lord, truthfully, in order to stabi-
lize those who believe, and as guidance and
good news for those who submit.”
103. We are well aware that they say, “It is a hu-
man being who is teaching him.” But the
tongue of him they allude to is foreign, while
this is a clear Arabic tongue.
104. Those who do not believe in Allah’s reve-
lations—Allah will not guide them, and for
them is a painful punishment.
105. It is those who do not believe in Allah’s
revelations who fabricate falsehood. These
are the liars.
106. Whoever renounces faith in Allah after
having believed—except for someone who is
compelled, while his heart rests securely in
faith—but whoever willingly opens up his
heart to disbelief—upon them falls wrath
from Allah, and for them is a tremendous
torment.
107. That is because they have preferred the
worldly life to the Hereafter, and because Al-
lah does not guide the people who refuse.
108. It is they whom Allah has sealed their
hearts, and their hearing, and their sight. It is
they who are the heedless.
109. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter
they will be the losers.
110. But then your Lord—for those who emi-
grated after being persecuted, then struggled
and persevered—your Lord thereafter is For-
giving and Merciful.
111. On the Day when every soul will come
pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid
in full for what it has done, and they will not
be wronged.
112. And Allah cites the example of a town that
was secure and peaceful, with its livelihood
coming to it abundantly from every direc-
tion. But then it turned unappreciative of Al-
lah’s blessings, so Allah made it taste the robe
of hunger and fear, because of what they used
to craft.
113. A messenger from among them had come
to them, but they denounced him, so the
punishment seized them in the midst of their
wrongdoing.
114. Eat of the lawful and good things Allah has
provided for you, and be thankful for Allah’s
blessings, if it is Him that you serve.
115. He has forbidden you carrion, and blood,
and the flesh of swine, and anything conse-
crated to other than Allah. But if anyone is
compelled by necessity, without being delib-
erate or malicious, then Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.
116. And do not say of falsehood asserted by
your tongues, “This is lawful, and this is un-
lawful,” in order to invent lies and attribute
them to Allah. Those who invent lies and at-
tribute them to Allah will not succeed.
117. A brief enjoyment—then they will have a
painful punishment.
118. For those who are Jews, We have prohib-
ited what We related to you before. We did
not wrong them, but they used to wrong their
own selves.
119. But towards those who do wrongs in igno-
rance, and then repent afterwards and re-
form, your Lord thereafter is Forgiving and
Merciful.
120. Abraham was an exemplary leader, de-
voted to Allah, a monotheist, and was not of
the polytheists.
121. Thankful for His blessings. He chose him,
and guided him to a straight path.
122. And We gave him goodness in this world,
and in the Hereafter he will be among the
righteous.
123. Then We inspired you: “Follow the reli-
gion of Abraham, the Monotheist. He was
not an idol-worshiper.”
124. The Sabbath was decreed only for those
who differed about it. Your Lord will judge
between them on the Day of Resurrection re-
garding their differences.
10117. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
Invite to the way of your Lord with wis-
dom and good advice, and debate with them
in the most dignified manner. Your Lord is
aware of those who stray from His path, and
He is aware of those who are guided.
126. If you were to retaliate, retaliate to the
same degree as the injury done to you. But if
you resort to patience—it is better for the pa-
tient.
127. So be patient. Your patience is solely from
Allah. And do not grieve over them, and do
not be stressed by their schemes.
128. Allah is with those who are righteous and
those who are virtuous.
125.
17. THE NIGHT JOURNEY
(al-Isra’)

1. Glory
to Him who journeyed His servant by
night, from the Sacred Mosque, to the Far-
thest Mosque, whose precincts We have
blessed, in order to show him of Our won-
ders. He is the Listener, the Beholder.
2. And We gave Moses the Scripture, and
made it a guide for the Children of Israel:
Take none for protector other than Me.
3. The descendants of those We carried with
Noah. He was an appreciative servant.
4. And We conveyed to the Children of Israel
in the Scripture: You will commit evil on
earth twice, and you will rise to a great height.
5. When the first of the two promises came
true, We sent against you servants of Ours,
possessing great might, and they ransacked
your homes. It was a promise fulfilled.
6. Then We gave you back your turn against
them, and supplied you with wealth and chil-
dren, and made you more numerous.
7. If you work righteousness, you work right-
eousness for yourselves; and if you commit
evil, you do so against yourselves. Then,
when the second promise comes true, they
will make your faces filled with sorrow, and
enter the Temple as they entered it the first
time, and utterly destroy all that falls into
their power.
8. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you.
But if you revert, We will revert. We have
made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.
9. This Quran guides to what is most upright;
and it gives good news to the believers who
do good deeds, that they will have a great re-
ward.
10. And those who do not believe in the Here-
after—We have prepared for them a painful
punishment.
11. The human being prays for evil as he prays
for good. The human being is very hasty.
12. We have made the night and the day two
wonders. We erased the wonder of the night,
and made the wonder of the day revealing,
that you may seek bounty from your Lord,
and know the number of years, and the cal-
culation. We have explained all things in de-
tail.
13. For every person We have attached his fate
to his neck. And on the Day of Resurrection,
We will bring out for him a book which he
will find spread open.
14. “Read your book; today there will be none
but yourself to call you to account.”
15. Whoever is guided—is guided for his own
good. And whoever goes astray—goes astray
to his detriment. No burdened soul carries
the burdens of another, nor do We ever pun-
ish until We have sent a messenger.
16. When We decide to destroy a town, We
command its affluent ones, they transgress in
it, so the word becomes justified against it,
and We destroy it completely.
17. How many generations have We destroyed
after Noah? Your Lord is sufficient as
Knower and Beholder of the sins of his serv-
ants.
18. Whoever desires the fleeting life, We expe-
dite for him what We decide to give him, to
whomever We desire. Then We consign him
10217. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
to Hell, where he will roast, condemned and
defeated.
19. But whoever desires the Hereafter, and
pursues it as it should be pursued, while he is
a believer; these—their effort will be appreci-
ated.
20. To all—these and those—We extend from
the gifts of your Lord. The gifts of your Lord
are not restricted.
21. See how We have favored some of them
over others; yet the Hereafter is greater in
ranks, and greater in favors.
22. Do not set up another god with Allah, lest
you become condemned and damned.
23. Your Lord has commanded that you wor-
ship none but Him, and that you be good to
your parents. If either of them or both of
them reach old age with you, do not say to
them a word of disrespect, nor scold them,
but say to them kind words.
24. And lower to them the wing of humility,
out of mercy, and say, “My Lord, have mercy
on them, as they raised me when I was a
child.”
25. Your Lord knows best what is in your
minds. If you are righteous—He is Forgiving
to the obedient.
26. And give the relative his rights, and the
poor, and the wayfarer, and do not squander
wastefully.
27. The extravagant are brethren of the devils,
and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
28. But if you turn away from them, seeking
mercy from your Lord which you hope for,
then say to them words of comfort.
29. And do not keep your hand tied to your
neck, nor spread it out fully, lest you end up
liable and regretful.
30. Your Lord expands the provision for
whomever He wills, and restricts it. He is
fully Informed, Observant of His servants.
31. And do not kill your children for fear of
poverty. We provide for them, and for you.
Killing them is a grave sin.
And do not come near adultery. It is im-
moral, and an evil way.
33. And do not kill the soul which Allah has
made sacred, except in the course of justice.
If someone is killed unjustly, We have given
his next of kin certain authority. But he
should not be excessive in killing, for he will
be supported.
34. And do not go near the orphan’s property,
except with the best of intentions, until he has
reached his maturity. And honor your
pledge, because the pledge involves responsi-
bility.
35. And give full measure when you measure,
and weigh with accurate scales. That is fair,
and the best determination.
36. And do not occupy yourself with what you
have no knowledge of. The hearing, and the
sight, and the brains—all these will be ques-
tioned.
37. And do not walk proudly on earth. You can
neither pierce the earth, nor can you match
the mountains in height.
38. The evil of all these is disliked by your
Lord.
39. That is some of the wisdom your Lord has
revealed to you. Do not set up with Allah an-
other god, or else you will be thrown in Hell,
rebuked and banished.
40. Has your Lord favored you with sons,
while choosing for Himself daughters from
among the angels? You are indeed saying a
terrible thing.
41. We have explained in this Quran in various
ways, that they may remember, but it only
adds to their rebellion.
42. Say, “If there were other gods with Him, as
they say, they would have sought a way to the
Lord of the Throne.”
43. Be He glorified. He is exalted, far above
what they say.
44. Praising Him are the seven heavens, and
the earth, and everyone in them. There is not
a thing that does not glorify Him with praise,
32.
10317. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
but you do not understand their praises. He
is indeed Forbearing and Forgiving.
45. When you read the Quran, We place be-
tween you and those who do not believe in
the Hereafter an invisible barrier.
46. And We drape veils over their hearts, pre-
venting them from understanding it, and
heaviness in their ears. And when you men-
tion your Lord alone in the Quran, they turn
their backs in aversion.
47. We know well what they listen to, when
they listen to you, as they conspire, when the
wrongdoers say, “You only follow a man be-
witched.”
48. Note what they compared you to. They are
lost, and unable to find a way.
49. And they say, “When we have become
bones and fragments, shall we really be resur-
rected as a new creation?”
50. Say,
“Even if you become rocks or iron.
some substance, which, in your minds,
is even harder.” Then they will say, “Who will
restore us?” Say, “The One who originated
you the first time.” Then they will nod their
heads at you, and say, “When will it be?” Say,
“Perhaps it will be soon.”
52. On the Day when He calls you, you will re-
spond with His praise, and you will realize
that you stayed only a little.
53. Tell My servants to say what is best. Satan
sows discord among them. Satan is to man an
open enemy.
54. Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He
will have mercy on you; and if He wills, He
will punish you. We did not send you as their
advocate.
55. Your Lord knows well everyone in the
heavens and the earth. We have given some
prophets advantage over others; and to David
We gave the Psalms.
56. Say, “Call upon those you claim besides
Him. They have no power to relieve your ad-
versity, nor can they change it.”
51. Or
57. Those they call upon are themselves seek-
ing means of access to their Lord, vying to be
nearer, and hoping for His mercy, and fear-
ing His punishment. The punishment of your
Lord is to be dreaded.
58. There is no city but We will destroy before
the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with a
severe punishment. This is inscribed in the
Book.
59. Nothing prevents Us from sending mirac-
ulous signs, except that the ancients called
them lies. We gave Thamood the she-camel,
a visible sign, but they mistreated her. We do
not send the signs except to instill reverence.
60. We said to you that your Lord encom-
passes humanity. We did not make the vision
We showed you, except as a test for the peo-
ple, and the tree cursed in the Quran. We
frighten them, but that only increases their
defiance.
61. When We said to the angels, “Bow down
before Adam,” they bowed down, except for
Satan. He said, “Shall I bow down before
someone You created from mud?”
62. He said, “Do You see this one whom You
have honored more than me? If You reprieve
me until the Day of Resurrection, I will bring
his descendants under my sway, except for a
few.”
63. He said, “Begone! Whoever of them fol-
lows you—Hell is your reward, an ample re-
ward.”
64. “And entice whomever of them you can
with your voice, and rally against them your
cavalry and your infantry, and share with
them in wealth and children, and make
promises to them.” But Satan promises them
nothing but delusion.
65. “As for My devotees, you have no authority
over them.” Your Lord is an adequate Guard-
ian.
66. Your Lord is He who propels for you the
ships at sea, that you may seek of His bounty.
He is towards you Most Merciful.
10417. THE NIGHT JOURNEY (al-Isra’)
When harm afflicts you at sea, those you
pray to vanish, except for Him. But when He
saves you to land, you turn away. The human
being is ever thankless.
68. Are you confident that He will not cause a
track of land to cave in beneath you, or un-
leash a tornado against you, and then you
find no protector?
69. Or are you confident that He will not re-
turn you to it once again, and unleash a hur-
ricane against you, and drown you for your
ingratitude? Then you will find no helper
against Us.
70. We have honored the Children of Adam,
and carried them on land and sea, and pro-
vided them with good things, and greatly fa-
vored them over many of those We created.
71. On the Day when We call every people with
their leader. Whoever is given his record in
his right hand—these will read their record,
and they will not be wronged one bit.
72. But whoever is blind in this, he will be
blind in the Hereafter, and further astray
from the way.
73. They almost lured you away from what We
have revealed to you, so that you would in-
vent something else in Our name. In that
case, they would have taken you for a friend.
74. Had We not given you stability, you might
have inclined towards them a little.
75. Then We would have made you taste dou-
ble in life, and double at death; then you
would have found for yourself no helper
against Us.
76. They almost provoked you, to expel you
from the land. In that case, they would not
have lasted after you, except briefly.
77. The tradition of the messengers We sent
before you—you will find no change in Our
rules.
78. Perform the prayer at the decline of the
sun, until the darkness of the night; and the
Quran at dawn. The Quran at dawn is wit-
nessed.
67.
And keep vigil with it during parts of the
night, as an extra prayer. Perhaps your Lord
will raise you to a laudable position.
80. And say, “My Lord, lead me in through an
entry of truth, and lead me out through an
exit of truth, and grant me from You a sup-
porting power.”
81. And say, “The truth has come, and false-
hood has withered away; for falsehood is
bound to wither away.”
82. We send down in the Quran healing and
mercy for the believers, but it increases the
wrongdoers only in loss.
83. When We bless the human being, he turns
away and distances himself. But when adver-
sity touches him, he is in despair.
84. Say, “Each does according to his disposi-
tion. Your Lord knows best who is better
guided in the way.”
85. And they ask you about the Spirit. Say,
“The Spirit belongs to the domain of my
Lord; and you were given only little
knowledge.”
86. If We willed, We could take away what We
revealed to you. Then you will find for your-
self no protecting guardian against Us.
87. Except through a mercy from your Lord.
His favors upon you have been great.
88. Say, “If mankind and jinn came together to
produce the like of this Quran, they could
never produce the like of it, even if they
backed up one another.”
89. We have displayed for mankind in this
Quran every kind of similitude, but most
people insist on denying the truth.
90. And they said, “We will not believe in you
unless you make a spring burst from the
ground for us.
91. Or you have a garden of palms and vines;
then cause rivers to gush pouring through
them.
92. Or make the sky fall on us in pieces, as you
claim, or bring Allah and the angels before us.
79.
10518. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
93. Or you possess a house of gold. Or you as-
cend into the sky. Even then, we will not be-
lieve in your ascension, unless you bring
down for us a book that we can read.” Say,
“Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything but a
human messenger?”
94. Nothing prevented the people from believ-
ing, when guidance has come to them, except
that they said, “Did Allah send a human mes-
senger?”
95. Say, “If there were angels on earth, walking
around in peace, We would have sent down
to them from heaven an angel messenger.”
96. Say, “Allah is enough witness between you
and me. He is fully aware of His servants, and
He sees them well.”
97. Whomever Allah guides is the guided one.
And whomever He leaves astray—for them
you will find no protectors apart from Him.
And We will gather them on the Day of Res-
urrection, on their faces, blind, dumb, and
deaf. Their abode is Hell; whenever it abates,
We intensify the blaze for them.
98. This is their repayment for having blas-
phemed against Our revelations, and having
said, “Shall we, when we have become bones
and fragments, be resurrected as a new crea-
tion?”
99. Do they not consider that Allah, Who cre-
ated the heavens and the earth, is Able to cre-
ate the likes of them? He has assigned for
them a term, in which there is no doubt. But
the wrongdoers persist in denying the truth.
100. Say, “If you possessed the treasuries of my
Lord’s mercy, you would have withheld them
for fear of spending.” The human being has
always been stingy.
101. We gave Moses nine clear signs—ask the
Children of Israel. When he went to them,
Pharaoh said to him, “I think that you, Mo-
ses, are bewitched.”
102. He said, “You know that none sent these
down except the Lord of the heavens and the
earth—eye openers; and I think that you,
Pharaoh, are doomed.”
103. He resolved to scare them off the land, but
We drowned him, and those with him, alto-
gether.
104. After him, We said to the Children of Is-
rael, “Inhabit the land, and when the promise
of the Hereafter arrives, We will bring you all
together.”
105. With the truth We sent it down, and with
the truth it descended. We sent you only as a
bearer of good news and a warner.
106. A Quran which We unfolded gradually,
that you may recite to the people over time.
And We revealed it in stages.
107. Say, “Believe in it, or do not believe.”
Those who were given knowledge before it,
when it is recited to them, they fall to their
chins, prostrating.
108. And they say, “Glory to our Lord. The
promise of our Lord is fulfilled.”
109. And they fall to their chins, weeping, and
it adds to their humility.
110. Say, “Call Him Allah, or call Him the Most
Merciful. Whichever name you use, to Him
belong the Best Names.” And be neither loud
in your prayer, nor silent in it, but follow a
course in between.
111. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not
begotten a son, nor has He a partner in sov-
ereignty, nor has He an ally out of weakness,
and glorify Him constantly.”
18. THE CAVE
(al-Kahf)

1. Praise
be to Allah, who revealed the Book to
His servant, and allowed in it no distortion.
2. Valuable—to warn of severe punishment
from Himself; and to deliver good news to the
believers who do righteous deeds, that they
will have an excellent reward.
3. In
106
which they will abide forever.18. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
4. And
to warn those who say, “Allah has be-
gotten a son.”
5. They have no knowledge of this, nor did
their forefathers. Grave is the word that
comes out of their mouths. They say nothing
but a lie.
6. Perhaps you may destroy yourself with
grief, chasing after them, if they do not be-
lieve in this information.
7. We made what is upon the earth an orna-
ment for it, to test them as to which of them
is best in conduct.
8. And We will turn what is on it into barren
waste.
9. Did you know that the People of the Cave
and the Inscription were of Our wondrous
signs?
10. When the youths took shelter in the cave,
they said, “Our Lord, give us mercy from
Yourself, and bless our affair with guidance.”
11. Then We sealed their ears in the cave for a
number of years.
12. Then We awakened them to know which
of the two groups could better calculate the
length of their stay.
13. We relate to you their story in truth. They
were youths who believed in their Lord, and
We increased them in guidance.
14. And We strengthened their hearts, when
they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord
of the heavens and the earth; we will not call
on any god besides Him, for then we would
have spoken an outrage.”
15. “These people, our people, have taken to
themselves gods other than Him. Why do
they not bring a clear proof concerning
them? Who, then, does greater wrong than he
who invents lies and attributes them to Al-
lah?”
16. “Now that you have withdrawn from them,
and from what they worship besides Allah,
take shelter in the cave. And your Lord will
unfold His mercy for you, and will set your
affair towards ease.”
17. You would have seen the sun, when it rose,
veering away from their cave towards the
right, and when it sets, moving away from
them to the left, as they lay in the midst of the
cave. That was one of Allah’s wonders. He
whom Allah guides is truly guided; but he
whom He misguides, for him you will find no
directing friend.
18. You would think them awake, although
they were asleep. And We turned them over
to the right, and to the left, with their dog
stretching its paws across the threshold. Had
you looked at them, you would have turned
away from them in flight, and been filled with
fear of them.
19. Even so, We awakened them, so that they
may ask one another. A speaker among them
said, “How long have you stayed?” They said,
“We have stayed a day, or part of a day.” They
said, “Your Lord knows best how long you
have stayed.” “Send one of you to the city,
with this money of yours, and let him see
which food is most suitable, and let him bring
you some provision thereof. And let him be
gentle, and let no one become aware of you.”
20. “If they discover you, they will stone you,
or force you back into their religion; then you
will never be saved.”
21. So it was, that We caused them to be dis-
covered, that they would know that the
promise of Allah is true, and that of the Hour
there is no doubt. As they were disputing
their case among themselves, they said,
“Build over them a building.” Their Lord
knows best about them. Those who prevailed
over their case said, “We will set up over them
a place of worship.”
22. They will say, “Three, and their fourth be-
ing their dog.” And they will say, “Five, and
their sixth being their dog,” guessing at the
unknown. And they will say, “Seven, and
their eighth being their dog.” Say, “My Lord
knows best their number.” None knows them
except a few. So do not argue concerning
them except with an obvious argument, and
do not consult any of them about them.
10718. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
And never say about anything, “I will do
that tomorrow.”
24. Without saying, “If Allah wills.” And re-
member your Lord if you forget, and say,
“Perhaps my Lord will guide me to nearer
than this in integrity.”
25. And they stayed in their cave for three hun-
dred years, adding nine.
26. Say, “Allah knows best how long they
stayed.” His is the mystery of the heavens and
the earth. By Him you see and hear. They
have no guardian apart from Him, and He
shares His Sovereignty with no one.
27. And recite what was revealed to you from
the Book of your Lord. There is no changing
His words, and you will find no refuge except
in Him.
28. And content yourself with those who pray
to their Lord morning and evening, desiring
His Presence. And do not turn your eyes
away from them, desiring the glitter of this
world. And do not obey him whose heart We
have made heedless of Our remembrance—
so he follows his own desires—and his prior-
ities are confused.
29. And say, “The truth is from your Lord.
Whoever wills—let him believe. And who-
ever wills—let him disbelieve”. We have pre-
pared for the unjust a Fire, whose curtains
will hem them in. And when they cry for re-
lief, they will be relieved with water like mol-
ten brass, which scalds the faces. What a mis-
erable drink, and what a terrible place.
30. As for those who believe and lead a right-
eous life—We will not waste the reward of
those who work righteousness.
31. These will have the Gardens of Eden, be-
neath which rivers flow. Reclining on com-
fortable furnishings, they will be adorned
with bracelets of gold, and will wear green
garments of silk and brocade. What a won-
derful reward, and what an excellent resting-
place.
32. And cite for them the parable of two men.
To one of them We gave two gardens of vine,
23.
and We surrounded them with palm-trees,
and We placed between them crops.
33. Both gardens produced their harvest in
full, and suffered no loss. And We made a
river flow through them.
34. And thus he had abundant fruits. He said
to his friend, as he conversed with him, “I am
wealthier than you, and greater in man-
power.”
35. And he entered his garden, wronging him-
self. He said, “I do not think this will ever per-
ish.”
36. “And I do not think the Hour is coming.
And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will
find something better than this in return.”
37. His friend said to him, as he conversed
with him, “Are you being ungrateful to Him
who created you from dust, then from a
sperm-drop, then evolved you into a man?
38. But as for me, He is Allah, my Lord, and I
never associate with my Lord anyone.
39. When you entered your garden, why did
you not say, “As Allah wills; there is no power
except through Allah”? Although you see me
inferior to you in wealth and children.
40. Perhaps my Lord will give me something
better than your garden, and release upon it
thunderbolts from the sky, so it becomes bar-
ren waste.
41. Or its water will sink into the ground, and
you will be unable to draw it.”
42. And ruin closed in on his crops, and so he
began wringing his hands over what he had
invested in it, as it lays fallen upon its trellises.
And he was saying, “I wish I never associated
anyone with my Lord.”
43. He had no faction to help him besides Al-
lah, and he was helpless.
44. That is because authority belongs to Allah,
the True. He is Best in rewarding, and Best in
requiting.
45. And cite for them the parable of the pre-
sent life: it is like water that We send down
from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it;
10818. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
but then it becomes debris, scattered by the
wind. Allah has absolute power over every-
thing.
46. Wealth and children are the adornments of
the present life. But the things that last, the
virtuous deeds, are better with your Lord for
reward, and better for hope.
47. On the Day when We set the mountains in
motion; and you see the earth emerging; and
We gather them together, and leave none of
them behind.
48. They will be presented before your Lord in
a row. “You have come to Us as We created
you the first time. Although you claimed We
would not set a meeting for you.”
49. And the book will be placed, and you will
see the sinners fearful of its contents. And
they will say, “Woe to us! What is with this
book that leaves nothing, small or big, but it
has enumerated it?” They will find everything
they had done present. Your Lord does not
wrong anyone.
50. We said to the angels, “Bow down to
Adam.” So they bowed down, except for Sa-
tan. He was of the jinn, and he defied the
command of his Lord. Will you take him and
his offspring as lords instead of Me, when
they are an enemy to you? Evil is the ex-
change for the wrongdoers.
51. I did not call them to witness the creation
of the heavens and the earth, nor their own
creation; and I do not take the misleaders for
assistants.
52. On the Day when He will say, “Call on My
partners whom you have claimed.” They will
call on them, but they will not answer them.
And We will place between them a barrier.
53. And the sinners will see the Fire, and will
realize that they will tumble into it. They will
find no deliverance from it.
54. We have elaborated in this Quran for the
people every kind of example, but the human
being is a most argumentative being.
55. What prevented people from accepting
faith, when guidance has come to them, and
from seeking their Lord’s forgiveness? Unless
they are waiting for the precedent of the an-
cients to befall them, or to have the punish-
ment come upon them face to face.
56. We send the messengers only as deliverers
of good news and warners. Those who disbe-
lieve argue with false argument, in order to
defeat the truth thereby. They take My
Verses, and the warnings, for a joke.
57. Who does greater wrong than he, who,
when reminded of his Lord’s revelations,
turns away from them, and forgets what his
hands have put forward? We have placed
coverings over their hearts, lest they under-
stand it, and heaviness in their ears. And if
you call them to guidance, they will not be
guided, ever.
58. Your Lord is the Forgiver, Possessor of
Mercy. Were He to call them to account for
what they have earned, He would have has-
tened the punishment for them. But they
have an appointment from which they will
find no escape.
59. And these towns—We destroyed them
when they committed injustices, and We set
for their destruction an appointed time.
60. Recall when Moses said to his servant, “I
will not give up until I reach the junction of
the two rivers, even if it takes me years.”
61. Then, when they reached the junction be-
tween them, they forgot about their fish. It
found its way into the river, slipping away.
62. When they went further, he said to his
servant, “Bring us our lunch; we were ex-
posed in our travel to much fatigue.”
63. He said, “Do you remember when we
rested by the rock? I forgot about the fish. It
was only the devil who made me forget it.
And so it found its way to the river, amaz-
ingly.”
64. He said, “This is what we were seeking.”
And so they turned back retracing their steps.
65. Then they came upon a servant of Ours,
whom We had blessed with mercy from Us,
10918. THE CAVE (al-Kahf)
and had taught him knowledge from Our
Own.
66. Moses said to him, “May I follow you, so
that you may teach me some of the guidance
you were taught?”
67. He said, “You will not be able to endure
with me.
68. And how will you endure what you have no
knowledge of?”
69. He said, “You will find me, Allah willing,
patient; and I will not disobey you in any or-
der of yours.”
70. He said, “If you follow me, do not ask me
about anything, until I myself make mention
of it to you.”
71. So they set out. Until, when they had
boarded the boat, he holed it. He said, “Did
you hole it, to drown its passengers? You
have done something awful.”
72. He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not
be able to endure with me?”
73. He said, “Do not rebuke me for forgetting,
and do not make my course difficult for me.”
74. Then they set out. Until, when they en-
countered a boy, he killed him. He said, “Did
you kill a pure soul, who killed no one? You
have done something terrible.”
75. He said, “Did I not tell you that you will not
be able to endure with me?”
76. He said, “If I ask you about anything after
this, then do not keep company with me. You
have received excuses from me.”
77. So they set out. Until, when they reached
the people of a town, they asked them for
food, but they refused to offer them hospital-
ity. There they found a wall about to collapse,
and he repaired it. He said, “If you wanted,
you could have obtained a payment for it.”
78. He said, “This is the parting between you
and me. I will tell you the interpretation of
what you were unable to endure.
79. As for the boat, it belonged to paupers
working at sea. I wanted to damage it because
there was a king coming after them seizing
every boat by force.
80. As for the boy, his parents were believers,
and we feared he would overwhelm them
with oppression and disbelief.
81. So we wanted their Lord to replace him
with someone better in purity, and closer to
mercy.
82. And as for the wall, it belonged to two or-
phaned boys in the town. Beneath it was a
treasure that belonged to them. Their father
was a righteous man. Your Lord wanted them
to reach their maturity, and then extract their
treasure—as a mercy from your Lord. I did
not do it of my own accord. This is the inter-
pretation of what you were unable to en-
dure.”
83. And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say,
“I will tell you something about him.”
84. We established him on earth, and gave him
all kinds of means.
85. He
pursued a certain course.
Until, when he reached the setting of the
sun, he found it setting in a murky spring,
and found a people in its vicinity. We said, “O
Zul-Qarnain, you may either inflict a penalty,
or else treat them kindly.”
87. He said, “As for him who does wrong, we
will penalize him, then he will be returned to
his Lord, and He will punish him with an un-
heard-of torment.
88. “But as for him who believes and acts right-
eously, he will have the finest reward, and We
will speak to him of Our command with
ease.”
86.
89. Then
he pursued a course.
Until, when he reached the rising of the
sun, he found it rising on a people for whom
We had provided no shelter from it.
91. And so it was. We had full knowledge of
what he had.
90.
92. Then
he pursued a course.
Until, when he reached the point separat-
ing the two barriers, he found beside them a
93.
11019. MARY (Maryam)
people who could barely understand what is
said.
94. They said, “O Zul-Qarnain, the Gog and
Magog are spreading chaos in the land. Can
we pay you, to build between us and them a
wall?”
95. He said, “What my Lord has empowered
me with is better. But assist me with strength,
and I will build between you and them a
dam.”
96. “Bring me blocks of iron.” So that, when he
had leveled up between the two cliffs, he said,
“Blow.” And having turned it into a fire, he
said, “Bring me tar to pour over it.”
97. So they were unable to climb it, and they
could not penetrate it.
98. He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord.
But when the promise of my Lord comes true,
He will turn it into rubble, and the promise
of my Lord is always true.”
99. On that Day, We will leave them surging
upon one another. And the Trumpet will be
blown, and We will gather them together.
100. On that Day, We will present the disbe-
lievers to Hell, all displayed.
101. Those whose eyes were screened to My
message, and were unable to hear.
102. Do those who disbelieve think that they
can take My servants for masters instead of
Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospital-
ity of the faithless.
103. Say, “Shall We inform you of the greatest
losers in their works?”
104. “Those whose efforts in this world are
misguided, while they assume that they are
doing well.”
105. It is they who rejected the communica-
tions of their Lord, and the encounter with
Him. So their works are in vain. And on the
Day of Resurrection, We will consider them
of no weight.
106. That is their requital—Hell—on account
of their disbelief, and their taking My revela-
tions and My messengers in mockery.
107. As for those who believe and do righteous
deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise
for hospitality.
108. Abiding therein forever, without desiring
any change therefrom.
109. Say, “If the ocean were ink for the words
of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before
the words of my Lord run out,” even if We
were to bring the like of it in addition to it.
110. Say, “I am only a human being like you,
being inspired that your god is One God.
Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him
work righteousness, and never associate any-
one with the service of his Lord.”
19. MARY
(Maryam)

1. Kaf,
Ha, Ya, Ayn, Saad.
A mention of the mercy of your Lord to-
wards His servant Zechariah.
3. When he called on his Lord, a call in seclu-
sion.
4. He said, “My Lord, my bones have become
feeble, and my hair is aflame with gray, and
never, Lord, have I been disappointed in my
prayer to you.
5. “And I fear for my dependents after me, and
my wife is barren. So grant me, from Your-
self, an heir.
6. To inherit me, and inherit from the House
of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing.”
7. “O Zechariah, We give you good news of a
son, whose name is John, a name We have
never given before.”
8. He said, “My Lord, how can I have a son,
when my wife is barren, and I have become
decrepit with old age?”
9. He said, “It will be so, your Lord says, ‘it is
easy for me, and I created you before, when
you were nothing.’”
2.
11119. MARY (Maryam)
10. He said, “My Lord, give me a sign.” He said,
“Your sign is that you will not speak to the
people for three nights straight.”
11. And he came out to his people, from the
sanctuary, and signaled to them to praise
morning and evening.
12. “O John, hold on to the Scripture firmly,”
and We gave him wisdom in his youth.
13. And tenderness from Us, and innocence.
He was devout.
14. And kind to his parents; and he was not a
disobedient tyrant.
15. And peace be upon him the day he was
born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is
raised alive.
16. And mention in the Scripture Mary, when
she withdrew from her people to an eastern
location.
17. She screened herself away from them, and
We sent to her Our spirit, and He appeared
to her as an immaculate human.
18. She said, “I take refuge from you in the
Most Merciful, should you be righteous.”
19. He said, “I am only the messenger of your
Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son.”
20. She said, “How can I have a son, when no
man has touched me, and I was never un-
chaste?”
21. He said, “Thus said your Lord, `It is easy
for Me, and We will make him a sign for hu-
manity, and a mercy from Us. It is a matter
already decided.'“
22. So she carried him, and secluded herself
with him in a remote place.
23. The labor-pains came upon her, by the
trunk of a palm-tree. She said, “I wish I had
died before this, and been completely forgot-
ten.”
24. Whereupon he called her from beneath
her: “Do not worry; your Lord has placed a
stream beneath you.
25. And shake the trunk of the palm-tree to-
wards you, and it will drop ripe dates by you.”
26. “So eat, and drink, and be consoled. And if
you see any human, say, ‘I have vowed a fast
to the Most Gracious, so I will not speak to
any human today.'“
27. Then she came to her people, carrying him.
They said, “O Mary, you have done some-
thing terrible.
28. O sister of Aaron, your father was not an
evil man, and your mother was not a whore.”
29. So she pointed to him. They said, “How
can we speak to an infant in the crib?”
30. He said, “I am the servant of Allah. He has
given me the Scripture, and made me a
prophet.
31. And has made me blessed wherever I may
be; and has enjoined on me prayer and char-
ity, so long as I live.
32. And kind to my mother, and He did not
make me a disobedient rebel.
33. So Peace is upon me the day I was born,
and the day I die, and the Day I get resur-
rected alive.”
34. That is Jesus son of Mary—the Word of
truth about which they doubt.
35. It is not for Allah to have a child—glory be
to Him. To have anything done, He says to it,
“Be,” and it becomes.
36. “Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so wor-
ship Him. That is a straight path.”
37. But the various factions differed among
themselves. So woe to those who disbelieve
from the scene of a tremendous Day.
38. Listen to them and watch for them the Day
they come to Us. But the wrongdoers today
are completely lost.
39. And warn them of the Day of Regret, when
the matter will be concluded. Yet they are
heedless, and they do not believe.
40. It is We who will inherit the earth and eve-
ryone on it, and to Us they will be returned.
41. And mention in the Scripture Abraham.
He was a man of truth, a prophet.
11219. MARY (Maryam)
42. He said to his father, “O my father, why do
you worship what can neither hear, nor see,
nor benefit you in any way?
43. O my father, there has come to me
knowledge that never came to you. So follow
me, and I will guide you along a straight way.
44. O my father, do not worship the devil. The
devil is disobedient to the Most Gracious.
45. O my father, I fear that a punishment from
the Most Gracious will afflict you, and you
become an ally of the devil.”
46. He said, “Are you renouncing my gods, O
Abraham? If you do not desist, I will stone
you. So leave me alone for a while.”
47. He said, “Peace be upon you. I will ask my
Lord to forgive you; He has been Kind to me.
48. And I will withdraw from you, and from
what you pray to instead of Allah. And I will
pray to my Lord, and I hope I will not be dis-
appointed in my prayer to my Lord.”
49. When he withdrew from them, and from
what they worship besides Allah, We granted
him Isaac and Jacob. And each We made a
prophet.
50. And We gave them freely of Our mercy,
and gave them a noble reputation of truth.
51. And mention in the Scripture Moses. He
was dedicated. He was a messenger and a
prophet.
52. And We called him from the right side of
the Mount, and brought him near in com-
munion.
53. And We granted him, out of Our mercy,
his brother Aaron, a prophet.
54. And mention in the Scripture Ishmael. He
was true to his promise, and was a messenger,
a prophet.
55. And he used to enjoin on his people prayer
and charity, and he was pleasing to his Lord.
56. And mention in the Scripture Enoch. He
was a man of truth, a prophet.
57. And
We raised him to a high position.
58. These are some of the prophets Allah has
blessed, from the descendants of Adam, and
from those We carried with Noah, and from
the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and
from those We guided and selected. When-
ever the revelations of the Most Gracious are
recited to them, they would fall down, pros-
trating and weeping.
59. But they were succeeded by generations
who lost the prayers and followed their appe-
tites. They will meet perdition.
60. Except for those who repent, and believe,
and act righteously. These will enter Paradise,
and will not be wronged in the least.
61. The Gardens of Eden, promised by the
Most Merciful to His servants in the Unseen.
His promise will certainly come true.
62. They will hear no nonsense therein, but
only peace. And they will have their provision
therein, morning and evening.
63. Such is Paradise which We will give as in-
heritance to those of Our servants who are
devout.
64. “We do not descend except by the com-
mand of your Lord. His is what is before us,
and what is behind us, and what is between
them. Your Lord is never forgetful.”
65. Lord of the heavens and the earth and what
is between them. So worship Him, and perse-
vere in His service. Do you know of anyone
equal to Him?
66. And the human being says, “When I am
dead, will I be brought back alive?”
67. Does the human being not remember that
We created him before, when he was noth-
ing?
68. By your Lord, We will round them up, and
the devils, then We will bring them around
Hell, on their knees.
69. Then, out of every sect, We will snatch
those most defiant to the Most Merciful.
70. We are fully aware of those most deserving
to scorch in it.
11320. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
71. There is not one of you but will go down to
it. This has been an unavoidable decree of
your Lord.
72. Then We will rescue those who were de-
vout, and leave the wrongdoers in it, on their
knees.
73. When Our clear revelations are recited to
them, those who disbelieve say to those who
believe, “Which of the two parties is better in
position, and superior in influence?”
74. How many a generation have We de-
stroyed before them, who surpassed them in
riches and splendor?
75. Say, “Whoever is in error, the Most Merci-
ful will lead him on.” Until, when they see
what they were promised—either the punish-
ment, or the Hour. Then they will know who
was in worse position and weaker in forces.
76. Allah increases in guidance those who ac-
cept guidance. And the things that endure—
the righteous deeds—have the best reward
with your Lord, and the best outcome.
77. Have you seen him who denied Our reve-
lations, and said, “I will be given wealth and
children”?
78. Did he look into the future, or did he re-
ceive a promise from the Most Merciful?
79. No indeed! We will write what he says, and
will keep extending the agony for him.
80. Then We will inherit from him what he
speaks of, and he will come to Us alone.
81. And they took, besides Allah, other gods,
to be for them a source of strength.
82. By no means! They will reject their worship
of them, and become opponents to them.
83. Have you not considered how We dispatch
the devils against the disbelievers, exciting
them with incitement?
84. So do not hurry against them. We are
counting for them a countdown.
85. On the Day when We will gather the right-
eous to the Most Merciful, as guests.
86. And herd the sinners into hell, like animals
to water.
They will have no power of intercession,
except for someone who has an agreement
with the Most Merciful.
88. And they say, “The Most Merciful has be-
gotten a son.”
89. You have come up with something mon-
strous.
90. At which the heavens almost rupture, and
the earth splits, and the mountains fall and
crumble.
91. Because they attribute a son to the Most
Merciful.
92. It is not fitting for the Most Merciful to
have a son.
93. There is none in the heavens and the earth
but will come to the Most Merciful as a serv-
ant.
94. He has enumerated them, and counted
them one by one.
95. And each one of them will come to Him on
the Day of Resurrection alone.
96. Those who believe and do righteous deeds,
the Most Merciful will give them love.
97. We made it easy in your tongue, in order
to deliver good news to the righteous, and to
warn with it a hostile people.
98. How many a generation have We de-
stroyed before them? Can you feel a single
one of them, or hear from them the slightest
whisper?
87.

9. Has
the story of Moses reached you?
When he saw a fire, he said to his family,
“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can
bring you a torch therefrom, or find some
guidance by the fire.”
11. Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O
Moses.
12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes.
You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re-
vealed.
14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So
serve Me, and practice the prayer for My re-
membrance.
15. The Hour is coming—but I keep it almost
hidden—so that each soul will be paid for
what it endeavors.
16. And do not let him who denies it and fol-
lows his desire turn you away from it, lest you
fall.
17. And what is that in your right-hand, O Mo-
ses?”
18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and
herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses
for it.”
10.
19. He
said, “Throw it, O Moses.”
So he threw it—thereupon it became a
moving serpent.
21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear.
We will restore it to its original condition.
22. And press your hand to your side; it will
come out white, without a blemish—another
sign.

When We inspired your mother with the
inspiration.
39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into
the river. The river will wash him to shore,
where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his
will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon
you love from Me, so that you may be reared
before My eye.
40. When your sister walked along, and said,
‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take
care of him?' So We returned you to your
mother, that she may be comforted, and not
sorrow. And you killed a person, but We
saved you from stress; and We tested you
thoroughly. And you stayed years among the
people of Median. Then you came back, as
ordained, O Moses.
38.
41. And
I made you for Myself.
Go, you and your brother, with My signs,
and do not neglect My remembrance.

44. But
speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will re-
member, or have some fear.”
45. They said, “Lord, we fear he may persecute
us, or become violent.”
46. He said, “Do not fear, I am with you, I hear
and I see.
47. Approach him and say, `We are the mes-
sengers of your Lord; so let the Children of
Israel go with us, and do not torment them.
We bring you a sign from your Lord, and
peace be upon him who follows guidance.
48. It was revealed to us that the punishment
falls upon him who disbelieves and turns
away.'“
49. He
said, “Who is your Lord, O Moses.”
said, “Our Lord is He who gave every-
thing its existence, then guided it.”
51. He said, “What about the first genera-
tions?”
52. He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my
Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does
He forget.”
53. He who made the earth a habitat for you;
and traced in it routes for you; and sent down
water from the sky, with which We produce
pairs of diverse plants.
54. Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are
signs for those with understanding.
55. From it We created you, and into it We will
return you, and from it We will bring you out
another time.
56. We showed him Our signs, all of them, but
he denied and refused.
57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us
out of our land with your magic, O Moses?
58. We will produce for you magic like it; so
make an appointment between us and you,
which we will not miss—neither us, nor
you—in a central place.”
59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of
the festival, so let the people be gathered to-
gether at mid-morning.”
50. He
Pharaoh turned away, put together his
plan, and then came back.
61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not
fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy
you with a punishment. He who invents lies
will fail.”
62. They disagreed among themselves over
their affair, and conferred secretly.
63. They said, “These two are magicians who
want to drive you out of your land with their
magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of
life.
64. So settle your plan, and come as one front.
Today, whoever gains the upper hand will
succeed.”
65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or
we will be the first to throw.”
66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their
ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of
their magic, to be crawling swiftly.
60.
67. So
Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up-
permost.
69. Now throw down what is in your right
hand—it will swallow what they have crafted.
What they have crafted is only a magician’s
trickery. But the magician will not succeed,
no matter what he does.”
70. And the magicians fell down prostrate.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord of
Aaron and Moses.”
71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I
have given you permission? He must be your
chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off
your hands and your feet on alternate sides,
and I will crucify you on the trunks of the
palm-trees. Then you will know which of us
is more severe in punishment, and more last-
ing.”
72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the
proofs that have come to us, and Him who
created us. So issue whatever judgment you
wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly
life.
68. We
11620. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He
may forgive us our sins, and the magic you
have compelled us to practice. Allah is Better,
and more Lasting.”
74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him
is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.
75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, hav-
ing worked righteousness—these will have
the highest ranks.
76. The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which
rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is
the reward for him who purifies himself.
77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night
with My servants, and strike for them a dry
path across the sea, not fearing being over-
taken, nor worrying.”
78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but
the sea overwhelmed them, and completely
engulfed them.
79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not
guide them.
80. O Children of Israel! We have delivered
you from your enemy, and promised you by
the right side of the Mount, and sent down to
you manna and quails.
81. Eat of the good things We have provided
for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest
My wrath descends upon you. He upon
whom My wrath descends has fallen.
82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re-
pents, believes, acts righteously, and then re-
mains guided.
83. “And what made you rush ahead of your
people, O Moses?”
84. He said, “They are following in my foot-
steps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that
you may be pleased.”
85. He said, “We have tested your people in
your absence, and the Samarian misled
them.”
86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and
disappointed. He said, “O my people, did
your Lord not promise you a good promise?
Was the time too long for you? Or did you
want wrath from your Lord to descend upon
you, so you broke your promise to me?”
87. They said, “We did not break our promise
to you by our choice, but we were made to
carry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we
cast them in. That was what the Samarian
suggested.”
88. So he produced for them a calf—a mere
body which lowed. And they said, “This is
your god, and the god of Moses, but he has
forgotten.”
89. Did they not see that it cannot return a
word to them, and has no power to harm
them or benefit them?
90. Aaron had said to them before, “O my peo-
ple, you are being tested by this. And your
Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey
my command.”
91. They said, “We will not give up our devo-
tion to it, until Moses returns to us.”
92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you,
when you saw them going astray.
93. From following me? Did you disobey my
command?”
94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize
me by my beard or my head. I feared you
would say, `You have caused division among
the Children of Israel, and did not regard my
word.'“
95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Sa-
marian?”
96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I
grasped a handful from the Messenger’s
traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul
prompted me.”
97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in this life is to
say, ‘No contact.’ And you have an appoint-
ment that you will not miss. Now look at your
god that you remained devoted to—we will
burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea,
as powder.”
98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides
whom there is no other god. He compre-
hends everything in knowledge.
11720. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
Thus We narrate to you reports of times
gone by; and We have given you a message
from Our Presence.
100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on
the Day of Resurrection a burden.
101. Abiding therein forever. And wretched is
their burden on the Day of Resurrection.
102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown—
We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.
103. Murmuring among themselves: “You have
lingered only for ten.”
104. We are fully aware of what they say, when
the most exemplary of them in conduct will
say, “You have lingered only a day.”
105. And they ask you about the mountains.
Say, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”
99.
106. And
leave them desolate waste.
will see in them neither crookedness,
nor deviation.”
108. On that Day, they will follow the caller,
without any deviation. Voices will be hushed
before the Merciful, and you will hear noth-
ing but murmur.
109. On that Day, intercession will not avail,
except for him permitted by the Merciful, and
whose words He has approved.
110. He knows what is before them and what is
behind them, and they cannot comprehend
Him in their knowledge.
111. Faces will be humbled before the Living,
the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will
despair.
112. But whoever has done righteous deeds,
while being a believer—will fear neither in-
justice, nor grievance.
113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic
Quran, and We have diversified the warnings
in it, that perhaps they would become right-
eous, or it may produce a lesson for them.
114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be
hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to
you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase
me in knowledge.”
107. You
And We covenanted with Adam before,
but he forgot, and We found in him no re-
solve.
116. And when We said to the angels, “Bow
down to Adam.” They bowed down, except
for Satan; he refused.
117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you
and to your wife. So do not let him make you
leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.
118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na-
ked.
119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you
swelter.”
120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O
Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor-
tality, and a kingdom that never decays?”
121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their
bodies became visible to them, and they
started covering themselves with the leaves of
the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord,
and fell.
122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par-
doned him, and guided him.
123. He said, “Go down from it, altogether;
some of you enemies of some others. But
whenever guidance comes to you from Me,
whoever follows My guidance, will not go
astray, nor suffer.
124. But whoever turns away from My Re-
minder, for him is a confined life. And We
will raise him on the Day of Resurrection
blind.”
125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise
me blind, though I was seeing?”
126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came
to you, and you forgot them, today you will
be forgotten.”
127. Thus We recompense him who trans-
gresses and does not believe in the revelations
of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter
is more severe, and more lasting.
128. Is it not instructive to them, how many
generations before them We destroyed, in
115.
11821. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
whose settlements they walk? Surely in that
are signs for people of understanding.
129. Were it not for a word that issued from
your Lord, the inevitable would have hap-
pened, but there is an appointed term.
130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele-
brate the praises of your Lord before the ris-
ing of the sun, and before its setting. And
during the hours of the night glorify Him,
and at the borders of the day, that you may be
satisfied.
131. And do not extend your glance towards
what We have given some classes of them to
enjoy—the splendor of the life of this world—
that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s
provision is better, and more lasting.
132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa-
tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste-
nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good
ending is that for righteousness.
133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us
a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not
given enough miracles in the former scrip-
tures?
134. Had We destroyed them with a punish-
ment before him, they would have said, “Our
Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we
would have followed Your revelations before
we were humiliated and disgraced.”
135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You
will know who the people of the straight path
are, and who is rightly-guided.
21. THE PROPHETS
(al-Anbiya)

1. Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near, but
they turn away heedlessly.
2. No fresh reminder comes to them from
their Lord, but they listen to it playfully.
3. Their hearts distracted, the wrongdoers
confer secretly, “Is this anything but a mortal
like you? Will you take to sorcery, with open-
eyes?”
4. He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the
heaven and the earth; and He is the Hearer,
the Knower.”
5. And they said, “A jumble of dreams,” and,
“He made it up,” and, “He is a poet,” “let him
bring us a sign, like those sent to the an-
cients.”
6. None of the towns We destroyed before
them had believed. Will they, then, believe?
7. We did not send before you except men,
whom We inspired. Ask the people of
knowledge, if you do not know.
8. We did not make them mere bodies that ate
no food, nor were they immortal.
9. Then We fulfilled Our promise to them,
and We saved them together with whomever
We willed, and We destroyed the extrava-
gant.
10. We have sent down to you a Book, contain-
ing your message. Do you not understand?
11. How many a guilty town have We crushed,
and established thereafter another people?
12. Then, when they sensed Our might, they
started running away from it.
13. Do not run, but come back to your luxu-
ries, and to your homes, that you may be
questioned.
14. They
said, “Woe to us; we were unfair.”
This continued to be their cry, until We
made them silent ashes.
16. We did not create the sky and the earth and
what is between them for amusement.
17. If We wanted amusement, We could have
found it within Us, were We to do so.
18. In fact, We hurl the truth against falsehood,
and it crushes it, so it vanishes. Woe unto
you, for what you describe.
19. To Him belongs everyone in the heavens
and the earth. Those near Him are not too
proud to worship Him, nor do they waver.
15.
11921. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
20. They praise night and day, without ever tir-
ing.
21. Or have they taken to themselves gods
from the earth who resurrect?
22. If there were in them gods other than Al-
lah, they would have gone to ruin. So glory be
to Allah, Lord of the Throne, beyond what
they allege.
23. He will not be questioned about what He
does, but they will be questioned.
24. Or have they taken, besides Him, other
gods? Say, “Bring your proof. This is a mes-
sage for those with me, and a message of
those before me.” But most of them do not
know the truth, so they turn away.
25. We never sent a messenger before you
without inspiring him that: “There is no god
but I, so worship Me.”
26. And they say, “The Most Merciful has
taken to himself a son.” Be He glorified; they
are but honored servants.
27. They never speak before He has spoken,
and they only act on His command.
28. He knows what is before them, and what is
behind them; and they do not intercede ex-
cept for him whom He approves; and they
tremble in awe of Him.
29. And whoever of them says, “I am a god be-
sides Him,” We will reward him with Hell.
Thus We reward the wrongdoers.
30. Do the disbelievers not see that the heavens
and the earth were one mass, and We tore
them apart? And We made from water every
living thing. Will they not believe?
31. And We placed on earth stabilizers, lest it
sways with them, and We placed therein
signposts and passages, that they may be
guided.
32. And We made the sky a protected ceiling;
yet they turn away from its wonders.
33. It is He who created the night and the day,
and the sun and the moon; each floating in an
orbit.
We did not grant immortality to any hu-
man being before you. Should you die, are
they then the immortal?
35. Every soul will taste death. We burden you
with adversity and prosperity—a test. And to
Us you will be returned.
36. When those who disbelieve see you, they
treat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one
who mentions your gods?” And they reject
the mention of the Merciful.
37. The human being was created of haste. I
will show you My signs, so do not seek to rush
Me.
38. And they say, “When will this promise
come true, if you are truthful?”
39. If those who disbelieve only knew, when
they cannot keep the fire off their faces and
off their backs, and they will not be helped.
40. In fact, it will come upon them suddenly,
and bewilder them. They will not be able to
repel it, and they will not be reprieved.
41. Messengers before you were also ridiculed,
but those who jeered were surrounded by
what they had ridiculed.
42. Say, “Who guards you against the Merciful
by night and by day?” But they turn away
from the mention of their Lord.
43. Or do they have gods who can defend them
against Us? They cannot help themselves, nor
will they be protected from Us.
44. We have given these enjoyments, and their
ancestors, until time grew long upon them.
Do they not see how We gradually reduce the
land from its extremities? Are they then the
victors?
45. Say, “I am warning you through inspira-
tion.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when
they are being warned.
46. And when a breath of your Lord’s punish-
ment touches them, they say, “Woe to us, we
were truly wicked.”
47. We will set up the scales of justice for the
Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will suf-
fer the least injustice. And even if it be the
34.
12021. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
weight of a mustard-seed, We will bring it up.
Sufficient are We as Reckoners.
48. We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion,
and illumination, and a reminder for the
righteous.
49. Those who fear their Lord in private, and
are apprehensive of the Hour.
50. This too is a blessed message that We re-
vealed. Are you going to deny it?
51. We gave Abraham his integrity formerly,
and We knew him well.
52. When he said to his father and his people,
“What are these statues to which you are de-
voted?”
53. They said, “We found our parents wor-
shiping them.”
54. He said, “You and your parents are in evi-
dent error.”
55. They said, “Are you telling us the truth, or
are you just playing?”
56. He said, “Your Lord is the Lord of the
heavens and the earth, the One who created
them, and I bear witness to that.
57. “By Allah, I will have a plan for your statues
after you have gone away.”
58. So he reduced them into pieces, except for
their biggest, that they may return to it.
59. They said, “Who did this to our gods? He
is certainly one of the wrongdoers.”
60. They said, “We heard a youth mentioning
them. He is called Abraham.”
61. They said, “Bring him before the eyes of the
people, so that they may witness.”
62. They said, “Are you the one who did this to
our gods, O Abraham?”
63. He said, “But it was this biggest of them
that did it. Ask them, if they can speak.”
64. Then they turned to one another, and said,
“You yourselves are the wrongdoers.”
65. But they reverted to their old ideas: “You
certainly know that these do not speak.”
66. He said, “Do you worship, instead of Allah,
what can neither benefit you in anything, nor
harm you?
67. Fie on you, and on what you worship in-
stead of Allah. Do you not understand?”
68. They said, “Burn him and support your
gods, if you are going to act.”
69. We said, “O fire, be coolness and safety
upon Abraham.”
70. They planned to harm him, but We made
them the worst losers.
71. And We delivered him, and Lot, to the land
that We blessed for all people.
72. And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a
gift; and each We made righteous.
73. And We made them leaders, guiding by
Our command; and We inspired them to do
good works, and to observe the prayer, and to
give out charity. They were devoted servants
to Us.
74. And Lot—We gave him judgment and
knowledge, and We delivered him from the
town that practiced the abominations. They
were wicked and perverted people.
75. And We admitted him into Our mercy; for
He was one of the righteous.
76. And Noah, when he called before. So We
answered him, and delivered him and his
family from the great disaster.
77. And We supported him against the people
who rejected Our signs. They were an evil
people, so We drowned them all.
78. And David and Solomon, when they gave
judgment in the case of the field, when some
people’s sheep wandered therein by night;
and We were witnesses to their judgment.
79. And so We made Solomon understand it,
and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge.
And We subjected the mountains along with
David to sing Our praises, and the birds as
well—surely We did.
80. And We taught him the making of shields
for you, to protect you from your violence.
Are you, then, appreciative?
12121. THE PROPHETS (al-Anbiya)
81. And to Solomon the stormy wind, blowing
at His command towards the land that We
have blessed. We are aware of everything.
82. And of the devils were some that dived for
him, and performed other, lesser tasks. But
We kept them restrained.
83. And Job, when he cried out to his Lord:
“Great harm has afflicted me, and you are the
Most Merciful of the merciful.”
84. So We answered him, lifted his suffering,
and restored his family to him, and their like
with them—a mercy from Us, and a reminder
for the worshipers.
85. And Ishmael, and Enoch, and Ezekiel; each
was one of the steadfast.
86. And We admitted them into Our mercy.
They were among the righteous.
87. And Jonah, when he stormed out in fury,
thinking We had no power over him. But
then He cried out in the darkness, “There is
no god but You! Glory to You! I was one of
the wrongdoers!”
88. So We answered him, and saved him from
the affliction. Thus We save the faithful.
89. And Zechariah, when he called out to his
Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, even
though you are the Best of heirs.”

90. So We answered him, and gave him John.

We cured his wife for him. They used to
vie in doing righteous deeds, and used to call
on Us in love and awe, and they used to hum-
ble themselves to Us.

91. And she who guarded her virginity. We breathed into her of Our spirit, and made her
and her son a sign to the world.

92. This community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so worship Me.
93. But they splintered themselves into factions. They will all return to Us.
94. Whoever does righteous deeds, and is a believer, his effort will not be denied. We are
writing it down for him. 

95. There is a ban on the town that We had destroyed—that they will not return.
Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they swarm down from every mound.

97. The promise of truth has drawn near. The eyes of those who disbelieved will stare in
horror: “Woe to us. We were oblivious to this. In fact, we were wrongdoers.”

98. You and what you worship besides Allah are fuel for Hell. You will descend into it.
99. Had these been gods, they would not have descended into it. All will abide in it.
96.

100. In it they will wail. In it they will not hear. 
for those who deserved goodness from
Us—these will be kept away from it.

102. They will not hear its hissing, and they will forever abide in what their hearts desire.

103. The Supreme Fear will not worry them, and the angels will receive them: “This is your
Day which you were promised.”

104. On the Day when We fold the heaven, like the folding of a book. Just as We began the
first creation, We will repeat it—a promise binding on Us. We will act.

105. We have written in the Psalms, after the Reminder, that the earth will be inherited by
My righteous servants.

106. Indeed, in this is a message for people who
worship.

107. We did not send you except as mercy to mankind.

108. Say, “It is revealed to me that your God is
One God. Are you going to submit?”

109. But if they turn away, say, “I have informed you sufficiently. Although I do not
know whether what you are promised is near or far.”

110. He knows what is said openly, and He knows what you conceal.

111. “And I do not know whether it is perhaps a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”

112. He said, “My Lord, judge with justice.”

And, “Our Lord is the Gracious, Whose help
is sought against what you allege.”

101. As
