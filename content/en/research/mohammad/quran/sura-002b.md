<!-- 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water
down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. -->


{{< s v="22">}} Allah sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Allah.

{{< s v="23">}} If you doubt the Prophet Mohammad, then call your witnesses if you are truthful.
- But {{< s v="24">}} you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
<!-- 23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter like these, and  -->

{{< s v="25">}} To those who believe and do righteous deeds, give the good news that they will:
- have gardens beneath which rivers flow
- be provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance<!-- , they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will --> 
- have pure spouses there who will live with them forever.

<!-- 26. Allah does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As
for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who -->

{{< s v="26">}} The disbelievers will say: “What did Allah intend by this example?” He leads many astray and guides many.

Reply that <!-- thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He --> Allah misleads only the evildoers.

{{< s v="27">}} The losers are those who:
- violate Allah’s covenant after its confirmation
- sever what Allah has commanded to be joined
- commit evil on earth

{{< s v="28">}} Allah:
- gave you life
- will put you to death
- will bring you to life
- return you to Himself

How can you deny Allah?

{{< s v="29">}} He:
- created for you everything on earth
- then turned to the heaven and made them 7 heavens

{{< s v="30">}} Allah said to the angels that He is placing a successor on earth. The angels said “Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?” 

He replied: “I know what you do not know.”

{{< s v="31">}} He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the angels,
and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you are sincere.”

{{< s v="32">}} They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. <!-- It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.” -->

{{< s v="33">}} He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.”

When he told them their names, He said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”

{{< s v="34">}} We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

35. We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as
you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”

36. But Satan caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in. We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of
one another. And you will have residence on earth, and enjoyment for a while.”

37. Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him. He is the Relenting, the Merciful.

38. We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me,
then whoever follows My guidance—they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire—wherein they will remain forever.”

40. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
ings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill
your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge
to you, and fear Me.

41. And believe in what I revealed, confirming
what is with you; and do not be the first to deny it; and do not exchange My revelations
for a small price; and be conscious of Me.

42. And do not mix truth with falsehood, and
do not conceal the truth while you know.

43. And attend to your prayers, and practice
regular charity, and kneel with those who
kneel.

44. Do you command people to virtuous con-
duct, and forget yourselves, even though you
read the Scripture? Do you not understand?

45. And seek help through patience and
prayer. But it is difficult, except for the de-
vout.

46. Those who know that they will meet their
Lord, and that to Him they will return.

{{< s v="47">}} O Children of Israel! Remember <!-- My favor which I bestowed upon you, and I  -->that favored you over all nations.

48. And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another in the least, nor will any intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any ransom be taken from it, nor will they be helped.

49. And recall that We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter-
rible persecution, killing your sons and sparing your women. Therein was a tremendous
trial from your Lord.

50. And recall that We parted the sea for you, so We saved you, and We drowned the peo-
ple of Pharaoh as you looked on.

51. And recall that We appointed for Moses 40 nights. Then you took to worshiping the calf after him, and you turned wicked.

52. Then We pardoned you after that, so that you might be grateful.

53. We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.

54. And recall that Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have done wrong to yourselves by worshiping the calf. So repent to your Maker, and kill your egos. That would be better for you with your Maker.” So He turned to you in repentance. He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful.


55. And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will not believe in you unless we see Allah
plainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck you, as you looked on.

56. Then We revived you after your death, so that you may be appreciative.

57. We shaded you with clouds, and We sent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.”
They did not wrong Us, but they used to wrong their own souls.
58. And recall that We said, “Enter this town,
and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish;
but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.'
We will forgive your sins, and give increase to
the virtuous.”
59. But the wrongdoers among them substi-
tuted words other than those given to them,
so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague
from heaven, because of their wicked behav-
ior.
60. And recall when Moses prayed for water
for his people. We said, “Strike the rock with
your staff.” Thereupon twelve springs gushed
out from it, and each tribe recognized its
drinking-place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s
provision, and do not corrupt the earth with
disobedience.”

61. And recall when you said, “O Moses, we cannot endure one kind of food, so call to
your Lord to produce for us of what the earth grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its
garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said, “Would you substitute worse for better? Go
down to Egypt, where you will have what you asked for.” They were struck with humiliation and poverty, and incurred wrath from Allah. That was because they rejected Allah’s revelations and wrongfully killed the prophets. That was because they disobeyed and transgressed.

62. Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and the Sabeans—any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and act righteously—will have their reward with their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.

63. And recall when We received a pledge from you, and raised the Mount above you:
“Take what We have given you earnestly, and remember what is in it, that you may attain righteousness.”

64. But after that you turned away. Were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you
would have been among the losers.

65. And you surely knew those of you who violated the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be despicable apes!”

66. Thus We made it a deterrent for their generation, and for subsequent generations, and
a lesson for the righteous.

67. And recall when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a heifer.”
They said, “Do you make a mockery of us?”

He said, “Allah forbid that I should be so ignorant.”

68. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us which one.” He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither too old, nor too young, but in between. So do what you are commanded.”

69. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us what her color is.” He said, “He says she is a
yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the beholders.”

70. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us which one; the heifers look alike to us; and
Allah willing, we will be guided.” 

71. He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the
field; sound without blemish.” They said, “Now you have brought the truth.” So they slew her; though they almost did not.

72. And recall when you killed a person, and disputed in the matter; but Allah was to expose what you were hiding.

73. We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus Allah brings the dead to life; and He shows you His signs, that you may understand.

74. Then after that your hearts hardened. They were as rocks, or even harder. For there are some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others that splinter and water comes out from them, and others that sink in awe of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what you do.

75. Do you hope that they will believe in you, when some of them used to hear the Word of Allah, and then deliberately distort it, even after understanding it?

76. When they come across those who believe, they say, “We believe,” but when they come together privately, they say, “Will you inform them of what Allah has disclosed to you, so that they might dispute with you concerning it before your Lord?” Do you not understand?

77. Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?

78. And among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay,
and they only speculate.

79. So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands, and then say, “This is from Allah,” that they may exchange it for a little price. Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they earn.

80. They say, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you received a promise from Allah—Allah never breaks His promise—or are you saying about Allah what you do not know?”

81. Whoever commits misdeeds, and becomes besieged by his iniquities—these are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will dwell forever.

<!-- 82. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds—these are the inhabitants of Paradise, wherein they will dwell forever. -->

83. We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: “Worship only Allah. Be good to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and
the needy; and speak nicely to people; and pray regularly, and give alms.” Then you turned away, except for a few of you, recanting.

84. We made a covenant with you: “You shall not shed the blood of your own, nor shall you evict your own from your homes.” 

You agreed, and were all witnesses.

85. But here you are, killing your own, and expelling a group of your own from their homes—conspiring against them in wrong-doing and hostility. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although it was forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? 

What is the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? 

On Resurrection Day, they will be assigned to the most severe torment.

86. Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
