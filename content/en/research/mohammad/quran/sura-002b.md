<!-- 22. He who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure, and sends water
down from the sky, and brings out fruits thereby, as a sustenance for you. -->


{{< s v="22">}} Allah sustains you. Therefore, do not assign rivals to Allah.

{{< s v="23">}} If you doubt the Prophet Mohammad, then call your witnesses if you are truthful.
- But {{< s v="24">}} you will not—then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
<!-- 23. And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a
chapter like these, and  -->


25. And give good news to those who believe and do righteous deeds; that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom as sustenance, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before,” and they will be given the like of it. And they will have pure spouses therein, and they will abide therein forever.

26. Allah does not shy away from making an example of a gnat, or something above it. As
for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who
disbelieve, they say, “What did Allah intend by this example?” He leads astray many
thereby, and He guides many thereby; but He misleads thereby only the evildoers.

27. Those who violate Allah’s covenant after its confirmation, and sever what Allah has com-
manded to be joined, and commit evil on earth. These are the losers.

28. How can you deny Allah, when you were dead and He gave you life, then He will put
you to death, then He will bring you to life, then to Him you will be returned?

29. It is He who created for you everything on earth, then turned to the heaven, and made
them seven heavens. And He is aware of all things.

30. When your Lord said to the angels, “I am placing a successor on earth.” They said,
“Will You place in it someone who will cause corruption in it and shed blood, while we declare Your praises and sanctify You?” He
said, “I know what you do not know.”

31. And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them to the angels,
and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if you
are sincere.”

32. They said, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise.”

33. He said, “O Adam, tell them their names.”
And when he told them their names, He said,
“Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of
the heavens and the earth, and that I know
what you reveal and what you conceal?”

34. And We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam.” They bowed down, except for Satan. He refused, was arrogant, and was one of the disbelievers.

35. We said, “O Adam, inhabit the Garden, you and your spouse, and eat from it freely as
you please, but do not approach this tree, lest you become wrongdoers.”

36. But Satan caused them to slip from it, and caused them to depart the state they were in. We said, “Go down, some of you enemies of
one another. And you will have residence on earth, and enjoyment for a while.”

37. Then Adam received words from his Lord, so He relented towards him. He is the Relenting, the Merciful.

38. We said, “Go down from it, all of you. Yet whenever guidance comes to you from Me,
then whoever follows My guidance—they have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

39. But as for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire—wherein they will remain forever.”

40. O Children of Israel! Remember My bless-
ings which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill
your pledge to Me, and I will fulfill My pledge
to you, and fear Me.

41. And believe in what I revealed, confirming
what is with you; and do not be the first to deny it; and do not exchange My revelations
for a small price; and be conscious of Me.

42. And do not mix truth with falsehood, and
do not conceal the truth while you know.

43. And attend to your prayers, and practice
regular charity, and kneel with those who
kneel.

44. Do you command people to virtuous con-
duct, and forget yourselves, even though you
read the Scripture? Do you not understand?

45. And seek help through patience and
prayer. But it is difficult, except for the de-
vout.

46. Those who know that they will meet their
Lord, and that to Him they will return.

47. O Children of Israel! Remember My favor
which I bestowed upon you, and I that fa-
vored you over all nations.

48. And beware of a Day when no soul will
avail another in the least, nor will any inter-
cession be accepted on its behalf, nor will any
ransom be taken from it, nor will they be
helped.
49. And recall that We delivered you from the
people of Pharaoh. They inflicted on you ter-
rible persecution, killing your sons and spar-
ing your women. Therein was a tremendous
trial from your Lord.
50. And recall that We parted the sea for you,
so We saved you, and We drowned the peo-
ple of Pharaoh as you looked on.
51. And recall that We appointed for Moses
forty nights. Then you took to worshiping the
calf after him, and you turned wicked.
52. Then We pardoned you after that, so that
you might be grateful.

53. We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion, so that you may be guided.

54. And recall that Moses said to his people, “O my people, you have done wrong to your-
selves by worshiping the calf. So repent to your Maker, and kill your egos. That would
be better for you with your Maker.” So He turned to you in repentance. He is the Ac-
cepter of Repentance, the Merciful.

55. And recall that you said, “O Moses, we will
not believe in you unless we see Allah
plainly.” Thereupon the thunderbolt struck
you, as you looked on.
56. Then We revived you after your death, so
that you may be appreciative.
57. And We shaded you with clouds, and We
sent down to you manna and quails: “Eat of
the good things We have provided for you.”
They did not wrong Us, but they used to
wrong their own souls.
58. And recall that We said, “Enter this town,
and eat plentifully from it whatever you wish;
but enter the gate humbly, and say, 'Pardon.'
We will forgive your sins, and give increase to
the virtuous.”
59. But the wrongdoers among them substi-
tuted words other than those given to them,
so We sent down on the wrongdoers a plague
from heaven, because of their wicked behav-
ior.
60. And recall when Moses prayed for water
for his people. We said, “Strike the rock with
your staff.” Thereupon twelve springs gushed
out from it, and each tribe recognized its
drinking-place. “Eat and drink from Allah’s
provision, and do not corrupt the earth with
disobedience.”
61. And recall when you said, “O Moses, we
cannot endure one kind of food, so call to
your Lord to produce for us of what the earth
grows: of its herbs, and its cucumbers, and its
garlic, and its lentils, and its onions.” He said,
“Would you substitute worse for better? Go
down to Egypt, where you will have what you
asked for.” They were struck with humilia-
tion and poverty, and incurred wrath from
Allah. That was because they rejected Allah’s
revelations and wrongfully killed the proph-
ets. That was because they disobeyed and
transgressed.
62. Those who believe, and those who are Jew-
ish, and the Christians, and the Sabeans—any
who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and act righteously—will have their reward with
their Lord; they have nothing to fear, nor will
they grieve.

63. And recall when We received a pledge
from you, and raised the Mount above you:
“Take what We have given you earnestly, and
remember what is in it, that you may attain
righteousness.”

64. But after that you turned away. Were it not
for Allah’s grace and mercy towards you, you
would have been among the losers.
65. And you surely knew those of you who vi-
olated the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be des-
picable apes!”
66. Thus We made it a deterrent for their gen-
eration, and for subsequent generations, and
a lesson for the righteous.
67. And recall when Moses said to his people,
“Allah commands you to sacrifice a heifer.”
They said, “Do you make a mockery of us?”
He said, “Allah forbid that I should be so ig-
norant.”
68. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us
which one.” He said, “He says she is a heifer,
neither too old, nor too young, but in be-
tween. So do what you are commanded.”
69. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us
what her color is.” He said, “He says she is a
yellow heifer, bright in color, pleasing to the
beholders.”
70. They said, “Call upon your Lord to show us
which one; the heifers look alike to us; and
Allah willing, we will be guided.”
71. He said, “He says she is a heifer, neither
yoked to plow the earth, nor to irrigate the
field; sound without blemish.” They said,
“Now you have brought the truth.” So they
slew her; though they almost did not.

72. And recall when you killed a person, and disputed in the matter; but Allah was to ex-
pose what you were hiding.

73. We said, “Strike him with part of it.” Thus Allah brings the dead to life; and He shows
you His signs, that you may understand.

74. Then after that your hearts hardened. They were as rocks, or even harder. For there are
some rocks from which rivers gush out, and others that splinter and water comes out
from them, and others that sink in awe of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what you do.

75. Do you hope that they will believe in you, when some of them used to hear the Word of
Allah, and then deliberately distort it, even after understanding it?

76. And when they come across those who believe, they say, “We believe,” but when they
come together privately, they say, “Will you inform them of what Allah has disclosed to
you, so that they might dispute with you concerning it before your Lord?” Do you not understand?

77. Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal?

78. And among them are uneducated who know the Scripture only through hearsay,
and they only speculate.

79. So woe to those who write the Scripture
with their own hands, and then say, “This is
from Allah,” that they may exchange it for a
little price. Woe to them for what their hands
have written, and woe to them for what they
earn.

80. And they say, “The Fire will not touch us
except for a number of days.” Say, “Have you
received a promise from Allah—Allah never
breaks His promise—or are you saying about
Allah what you do not know?”

81. Indeed, whoever commits misdeeds, and
becomes besieged by his iniquities—these are
the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will
dwell forever.
82. As for those who believe and do righteous
deeds—these are the inhabitants of Paradise,
wherein they will dwell forever.
83. We made a covenant with the Children of
Israel: “Worship none but Allah; and be good
to parents, and relatives, and orphans, and
the needy; and speak nicely to people; and
pray regularly, and give alms.” Then you turned away, except for a few of you, recanting.

84. And We made a covenant with you: “You shall not shed the blood of your own, nor
shall you evict your own from your homes.” 

You agreed, and were all witnesses.

85. But here you are, killing your own, and expelling a group of your own from their homes—conspiring against them in wrong-
doing and hostility. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although it was
forbidden to you. Is it that you believe in part of the Scripture, and disbelieve in part? 

What is the reward for those among you who do that but humiliation in this life? And on the
Day of Resurrection, they will be assigned to the most severe torment. Allah is not unaware of what you do.

86. Those are they who bought the present life for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not
be lightened for them, nor will they be helped.
