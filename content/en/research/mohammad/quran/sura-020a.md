revelation from He who created the earth and the high heavens.
<!-- 4. A
The Most Merciful; on the Throne He set-
tled. -->
6. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens
and the earth, and everything between them,
and everything beneath the soil.
7. If you speak aloud—He knows the secret,
and the most hidden.
8. Allah, there is no god but He, His are the
Most Beautiful Names.{{< s v="5" >}} {{< s v="9" >}}  Has
the story of Moses reached you?
When he saw a fire, he said to his family,
“Stay; I have noticed a fire; Perhaps I can
bring you a torch therefrom, or find some
guidance by the fire.”{{< s v="11" >}}  Then, when he reached it, he was called, “O
Moses.
12. I—I am your Lord. Take off your shoes.
You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa.
13. I have chosen you, so listen to what is re-
vealed.
14. I—I am Allah. There is no God but I. So
serve Me, and practice the prayer for My re-
membrance.
15. The Hour is coming—but I keep it almost
hidden—so that each soul will be paid for
what it endeavors.
{{< s v="16" >}}And do not let him who denies it and fol-
lows his desire turn you away from it, lest you
fall.
17. And what is that in your right-hand, O Mo-
ses?”
18. He said, “This is my staff. I lean on it, and
herd my sheep with it, and I have other uses
for it.”{{< s v="10" >}} 
19. He
said, “Throw it, O Moses.”
So he threw it—thereupon it became a
moving serpent.
21. He said, “Take hold of it, and do not fear.
We will restore it to its original condition.
22. And press your hand to your side; it will
come out white, without a blemish—another
sign.

He said, “My Lord, put my heart at peace

Moses.

had favored you another time.
When We inspired your mother with the
inspiration.
39. `Put him in the chest; then cast him into
the river. The river will wash him to shore,
where an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his
will pick him up. And I have bestowed upon
you love from Me, so that you may be reared
before My eye.
40. When your sister walked along, and said,
‘Shall I tell you about someone who will take
care of him?' So We returned you to your
mother, that she may be comforted, and not
sorrow. And you killed a person, but We
saved you from stress; and We tested you
thoroughly. And you stayed years among the
people of Median. Then you came back, as
ordained, O Moses.
38.
41. And
I made you for Myself.
Go, you and your brother, with My signs,
and do not neglect My remembrance.
42.
43. Go

to Pharaoh. He has tyrannized.20. TA-HA (Ta-Ha)
44. But
speak to him nicely. Perhaps he will re-
member, or have some fear.”
45. They said, “Lord, we fear he may persecute
us, or become violent.”
46. He said, “Do not fear, I am with you, I hear
and I see.
47. Approach him and say, `We are the mes-
sengers of your Lord; so let the Children of
Israel go with us, and do not torment them.
We bring you a sign from your Lord, and
peace be upon him who follows guidance.
48. It was revealed to us that the punishment
falls upon him who disbelieves and turns
away.'“
49. He
said, “Who is your Lord, O Moses.”
said, “Our Lord is He who gave every-
thing its existence, then guided it.”
51. He said, “What about the first genera-
tions?”
52. He said, “Knowledge thereof is with my
Lord, in a Book. My Lord never errs, nor does
He forget.”
53. He who made the earth a habitat for you;
and traced in it routes for you; and sent down
water from the sky, with which We produce
pairs of diverse plants.
54. Eat and pasture your livestock. In that are
signs for those with understanding.
55. From it We created you, and into it We will
return you, and from it We will bring you out
another time.
56. We showed him Our signs, all of them, but
he denied and refused.
57. He said, “Did you come to us to drive us
out of our land with your magic, O Moses?
58. We will produce for you magic like it; so
make an appointment between us and you,
which we will not miss—neither us, nor
you—in a central place.”
59. He said, “Your appointment is the day of
the festival, so let the people be gathered to-
gether at mid-morning.”
50. He
Pharaoh turned away, put together his
plan, and then came back.
61. Moses said to them, “Woe to you. Do not
fabricate lies against Allah, or He will destroy
you with a punishment. He who invents lies
will fail.”
62. They disagreed among themselves over
their affair, and conferred secretly.
63. They said, “These two are magicians who
want to drive you out of your land with their
magic, and to abolish your exemplary way of
life.
64. So settle your plan, and come as one front.
Today, whoever gains the upper hand will
succeed.”
65. They said, “O Moses, either you throw, or
we will be the first to throw.”
66. He said, “You throw.” And suddenly, their
ropes and sticks appeared to him, because of
their magic, to be crawling swiftly.
60.
67. So
Moses felt apprehensive within himself.
said, “Do not be afraid, you are the up-
permost.
69. Now throw down what is in your right
hand—it will swallow what they have crafted.
What they have crafted is only a magician’s
trickery. But the magician will not succeed,
no matter what he does.”
70. And the magicians fell down prostrate.
They said, “We have believed in the Lord of
Aaron and Moses.”
71. He said, “Did you believe in him before I
have given you permission? He must be your
chief, who has taught you magic. I will cut off
your hands and your feet on alternate sides,
and I will crucify you on the trunks of the
palm-trees. Then you will know which of us
is more severe in punishment, and more last-
ing.”
72. They said, “We will not prefer you to the
proofs that have come to us, and Him who
created us. So issue whatever judgment you
wish to issue. You can only rule in this lowly life.

73. We have believed in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins, and the magic you
have compelled us to practice. Allah is Better, and more Lasting.”
74. Whoever comes to his Lord guilty, for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives.
75. But whoever comes to Him a believer, having worked righteousness—these will have
the highest ranks.

76. The Gardens of Perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is
the reward for him who purifies himself. 

77. And We inspired Moses: “Travel by night with My servants, and strike for them a dry
path across the sea, not fearing being over-
taken, nor worrying.”
78. Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but
the sea overwhelmed them, and completely
engulfed them.
79. Pharaoh misled his people, and did not
guide them.
80. O Children of Israel! We have delivered
you from your enemy, and promised you by
the right side of the Mount, and sent down to
you manna and quails.
81. Eat of the good things We have provided
for you, but do not be excessive therein, lest
My wrath descends upon you. He upon
whom My wrath descends has fallen.
82. And I am Forgiving towards him who re-
pents, believes, acts righteously, and then re-
mains guided.
83. “And what made you rush ahead of your
people, O Moses?”
84. He said, “They are following in my foot-
steps; and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that
you may be pleased.”
85. He said, “We have tested your people in
your absence, and the Samarian misled
them.”
86. So Moses returned to his people, angry and
disappointed. He said, “O my people, did
your Lord not promise you a good promise?
Was the time too long for you? Or did you
want wrath from your Lord to descend upon
you, so you broke your promise to me?”
87. They said, “We did not break our promise
to you by our choice, but we were made to
carry loads of the people’s ornaments, and we
cast them in. That was what the Samarian
suggested.”
88. So he produced for them a calf—a mere
body which lowed. And they said, “This is
your god, and the god of Moses, but he has
forgotten.”
89. Did they not see that it cannot return a
word to them, and has no power to harm
them or benefit them?
90. Aaron had said to them before, “O my peo-
ple, you are being tested by this. And your
Lord is the Merciful, so follow me, and obey
my command.”
91. They said, “We will not give up our devo-
tion to it, until Moses returns to us.”
92. He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you,
when you saw them going astray.
93. From following me? Did you disobey my
command?”
94. He said, “Son of my mother, do not seize
me by my beard or my head. I feared you
would say, `You have caused division among
the Children of Israel, and did not regard my
word.'“
95. He said, “What do you have to say, O Sa-
marian?”
96. He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I
grasped a handful from the Messenger’s
traces, and I flung it away. Thus my soul
prompted me.”
97. He said, “Begone! Your lot in this life is to
say, ‘No contact.’ And you have an appoint-
ment that you will not miss. Now look at your
god that you remained devoted to—we will
burn it up, and then blow it away into the sea,
as powder.”
98. Surely your god is Allah, the One besides
whom there is no other god. He compre-
hends everything in knowledge.


Thus We narrate to you reports of times
gone by; and We have given you a message
from Our Presence.
100. Whoever turns away from it will carry on
the Day of Resurrection a burden.
101. Abiding therein forever. And wretched is
their burden on the Day of Resurrection.
102. On the Day when the Trumpet is blown—
We will gather the sinners on that Day, blue.
103. Murmuring among themselves: “You have
lingered only for ten.”
104. We are fully aware of what they say, when
the most exemplary of them in conduct will
say, “You have lingered only a day.”
105. And they ask you about the mountains.
Say, “My Lord will crumble them utterly.”
99.
106. And
leave them desolate waste.
will see in them neither crookedness,
nor deviation.”
108. On that Day, they will follow the caller,
without any deviation. Voices will be hushed
before the Merciful, and you will hear noth-
ing but murmur.
109. On that Day, intercession will not avail,
except for him permitted by the Merciful, and
whose words He has approved.
110. He knows what is before them and what is
behind them, and they cannot comprehend
Him in their knowledge.
111. Faces will be humbled before the Living,
the Eternal. Whoever carries injustice will
despair.
112. But whoever has done righteous deeds,
while being a believer—will fear neither in-
justice, nor grievance.
113. Thus We have revealed it an Arabic
Quran, and We have diversified the warnings
in it, that perhaps they would become right-
eous, or it may produce a lesson for them.
114. Exalted is Allah, the True King. Do not be
hasty with the Quran before its inspiration to
you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase
me in knowledge.”
107. You
And We covenanted with Adam before,
but he forgot, and We found in him no re-
solve.
1{{< s v="16" >}}And when We said to the angels, “Bow
down to Adam.” They bowed down, except
for Satan; he refused.
117. We said, “O Adam, this is an enemy to you
and to your wife. So do not let him make you
leave the Garden, for then you will suffer.
118. In it you will never go hungry, nor be na-
ked.
119. Nor will you be thirsty in it, nor will you
swelter.”
120. But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O
Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immor-
tality, and a kingdom that never decays?”
121. And so they ate from it; whereupon their
bodies became visible to them, and they
started covering themselves with the leaves of
the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord,
and fell.
122. But then his Lord recalled him, and par-
doned him, and guided him.
123. He said, “Go down from it, altogether;
some of you enemies of some others. But
whenever guidance comes to you from Me,
whoever follows My guidance, will not go
astray, nor suffer.
124. But whoever turns away from My Re-
minder, for him is a confined life. And We
will raise him on the Day of Resurrection
blind.”
125. He will say, “My Lord, why did You raise
me blind, though I was seeing?”
126. He will say, “Just as Our revelations came
to you, and you forgot them, today you will
be forgotten.”
127. Thus We recompense him who trans-
gresses and does not believe in the revelations
of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter
is more severe, and more lasting.
128. Is it not instructive to them, how many
generations before them We destroyed, in whose settlements they walk? Surely in that
are signs for people of understanding.
129. Were it not for a word that issued from
your Lord, the inevitable would have hap-
pened, but there is an appointed term.
130. So bear patiently what they say, and cele-
brate the praises of your Lord before the ris-
ing of the sun, and before its setting. And
during the hours of the night glorify Him,
and at the borders of the day, that you may be
satisfied.
131. And do not extend your glance towards
what We have given some classes of them to
enjoy—the splendor of the life of this world—
that We may test them thereby. Your Lord’s
provision is better, and more lasting.
132. And exhort your people to pray, and pa-
tiently adhere to it. We ask of you no suste-
nance, but it is We who sustain you. The good
ending is that for righteousness.
133. And they say, “Why does he not bring us
a miracle from his Lord?” Were they not
given enough miracles in the former scrip-
tures?
134. Had We destroyed them with a punish-
ment before him, they would have said, “Our
Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we
would have followed Your revelations before
we were humiliated and disgraced.”
135. Say, “Everybody is waiting, so wait. You
will know who the people of the straight path
are, and who is rightly-guided.
