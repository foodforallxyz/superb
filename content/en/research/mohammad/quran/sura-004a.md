1. O people! Fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and created from it its mate, and propagated from them many men and women. And revere Allah whom you ask about, and the parents. Surely, Allah is Watchful over you.

2. And give orphans their properties, and do not substitute the bad for the good. And do not consume their properties by combiningthem with yours, for that would be a serious sin.

3. If you fear you cannot act fairly towards the orphans—then marry the women you like—
two, or three, or four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then one, or what you already
have. That makes it more likely that you avoid bias.

4. Give women their dowries graciously. But if
they willingly forego some of it, then con-
sume it with enjoyment and pleasure.
5. Do not give the immature your money
which Allah has assigned to you for support.
But provide for them from it, and clothe
them, and speak to them with kind words.
6. Test the orphans until they reach the age of
marriage. If you find them to be mature
enough, hand over their properties to them.
And do not consume it extravagantly or hast-
ily before they grow up. The rich shall not
charge any wage, but the poor may charge
fairly. When you hand over their properties
to them, have it witnessed for them. Allah
suffices as a Reckoner.
7. Men receive a share of what their parents
and relatives leave, and women receive a
share of what their parents and relatives
leave; be it little or much—a legal share.
8. If the distribution is attended by the rela-
tives, and the orphans, and the needy, give
them something out of it, and speak to them
kindly.
9. Those who are concerned about the fate of
their weak children, in case they leave them
behind, should fear Allah, and speak appro-
priate words.
10. Those who consume the wealth of orphans
illicitly consume only fire into their bellies;
and they will roast in a Blaze.
11. Allah instructs you regarding your chil-
dren: The male receives the equivalent of the
share of two females. If they are daughters,
more than two, they get two-thirds of what he
leaves. If there is only one, she gets one-half.
As for the parents, each gets one-sixth of
what he leaves, if he had children. If he had
no children, and his parents inherit from him, his mother gets one-third. If he has sib-
lings, his mother gets one-sixth. After ful-
filling any bequest and paying off debts. Your
parents and your children—you do not know
which are closer to you in welfare. This is Al-
lah's Law. Allah is Knowing and Judicious.
12. You get one-half of what your wives leave
behind, if they had no children. If they had
children, you get one-fourth of what they
leave. After fulfilling any bequest and paying
off debts. They get one-fourth of what you
leave behind, if you have no children. If you
have children, they get one-eighth of what
you leave. After fulfilling any bequest and
paying off debts. If a man or woman leaves
neither parents nor children, but has a
brother or sister, each of them gets one-sixth.
If there are more siblings, they share one-
third. After fulfilling any bequest and paying
off debts, without any prejudice. This is a will
from Allah. Allah is Knowing and Clement.
13. These are the bounds set by Allah. Who-
ever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will
admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers
flow, to abide therein forever. That is the
great attainment.
14. But whoever disobeys Allah and His Mes-
senger, and oversteps His bounds, He will ad-
mit him into a Fire, wherein he abides for-
ever, and he will have a shameful punish-
ment.
15. Those of your women who commit lewd-
ness, you must have four witnesses against
them, from among you. If they testify, con-
fine them to the homes until death claims
them, or Allah makes a way for them.
16. If two men among you commit it, punish
them both. But if they repent and reform,
leave them alone. Allah is Redeemer, Full of
Mercy.
17. Repentance is available from Allah for
those who commit evil out of ignorance, and
then repent soon after. These—Allah will re-
lent towards them. Allah is Knowing and
Wise.
But repentance is not available for those
who commit evils, until when death ap-
proaches one of them, he says, “Now I re-
pent,” nor for those who die as disbelievers.
These—We have prepared for them a painful
torment.
19. O you who believe! It is not permitted for
you to inherit women against their will. And
do not coerce them in order to take away
some of what you had given them, unless they
commit a proven adultery. And live with
them in kindness. If you dislike them, it may
be that you dislike something in which Allah
has placed much good.
20. If you wish to replace one wife with an-
other, and you have given one of them a for-
tune, take nothing back from it. Would you
take it back fraudulently and sinfully?
21. And how can you take it back, when you
have been intimate with one another, and
they have received from you a solid commit-
ment?
22. Do not marry women whom your fathers
married, except what is already past. That is
improper, indecent, and a bad custom.
23. Forbidden for you are your mothers, your
daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts,
your maternal aunts, your brother's daugh-
ters, your sister's daughters, your foster-
mothers who nursed you, your sisters
through nursing, your wives' mothers, and
your stepdaughters in your guardianship—
born of wives you have gone into—but if you
have not gone into them, there is no blame on
you. And the wives of your genetic sons, and
marrying two sisters simultaneously. Except
what is past. Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.
24. And all married women, except those you
rightfully possess. This is Allah’s decree,
binding upon you. Permitted for you are
those that lie outside these limits, provided
you seek them in legal marriage, with gifts
from your property, seeking wedlock, not
prostitution. If you wish to enjoy them, then
give them their dowry—a legal obligation.
You commit no error by agreeing to any change to the dowry. Allah is All-Knowing,
Most Wise.
25. If any of you lack the means to marry free
believing women, he may marry one of the
believing maids under your control. Allah is
well aware of your faith. You are from one
another. Marry them with the permission of
their guardians, and give them their recompense fairly—to be protected—neither committing adultery, nor taking secret lovers.
When they are married, if they commit adultery, their punishment shall be half that of
free women. That is for those among you who
fear falling into decadence. But to practice
self-restraint is better for you. Allah is Most
Forgiving, Most Merciful.

26. Allah intends to make things clear to you,
and to guide you in the ways of those before
you, and to redeem you. Allah is Most Knowing, Most Wise.
27. Allah intends to redeem you, but those who follow their desires want you to turn
away utterly. 
28. Allah intends to lighten your burden, for
the human being was created weak.
29. O you who believe! Do not consume each
other’s wealth illicitly, but trade by mutual
consent. And do not kill yourselves, for Allah
is Merciful towards you.
30. Whoever does that, out of hostility and
wrongdoing, We will cast him into a Fire.
And that would be easy for Allah.
31. If you avoid the worst of what you are for-
bidden, We will remit your sins, and admit
you by a Gate of Honor.
32. Do not covet what Allah has given to some
of you in preference to others. For men is a
share of what they have earned, and for
women is a share of what they have earned.
And ask Allah of his bounty. Allah has
knowledge of everything.
33. To everyone We have assigned beneficiar-
ies in what is left by parents and relatives.
Those with whom you have made an agree-
ment, give them their share. Allah is Witness
over all things.
34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of
women, as Allah has given some of them an
advantage over others, and because they
spend out of their wealth. The good women
are obedient, guarding what Allah would
have them guard. As for those from whom
you fear disloyalty, admonish them, and
abandon them in their beds, then strike them.
But if they obey you, seek no way against
them. Allah is Sublime, Great.
35. If you fear a breach between the two, ap-
point an arbiter from his family and an arbi-
ter from her family. If they wish to reconcile,
Allah will bring them together. Allah is
Knowledgeable, Expert.
36. Worship Allah, and ascribe no partners to
Him, and be good to the parents, and the rel-
atives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the
neighbor next door, and the distant neighbor,
and the close associate, and the traveler, and
your servants. Allah does not love the arro-
gant showoff.
37. Those who are stingy, and exhort people to
stinginess, and conceal what Allah has given
them from His bounty. We have prepared for
the disbelievers a disgraceful punishment.
38. And those who spend their money to be
seen by people, and believe neither in Allah
nor in the Last Day. Whoever has Satan as a
companion—what an evil companion.
39. What would they have lost, had they be-
lieved in Allah and the Last Day, and gave out
of what Allah has provided for them? Allah
knows them very well.
40. Allah does not commit an atom's weight of
injustice; and if there is a good deed, He dou-
bles it, and gives from His Presence a sublime
compensation.
41. Then how will it be, when We bring a wit-
ness from every community, and We bring
you as a witness against these?
42. On that Day, those who disbelieved and
disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the
earth were leveled over them. They will con-
ceal nothing from Allah.

43. O believers! Do not approach the
prayer while you are drunk, so that you know
what you say; nor after sexual orgasm—un-
less you are travelling—until you have
bathed. If you are sick, or traveling, or one of
you comes from the toilet, or you have had
intercourse with women, and cannot find
water, find clean sand and wipe your faces
and your hands with it. Allah is Pardoning
and Forgiving.
44. Have you not considered those who were
given a share of the Book? They buy error,
and wish you would lose the way.
45. But Allah knows your enemies best. Allah
is sufficient as a Protector, and Allah is suffi-
cient as a Supporter.
46. Among the Jews are some who take words
out of context, and say, “We hear and we dis-
obey”, and “Hear without listening”, and
“Observe us,” twisting with their tongues and
slandering the religion. Had they said, “We
hear and we obey”, and “Listen”, and “Give
us your attention,” it would have been better
for them, and more upright. But Allah has
cursed them for their disbelief; they do not
believe except a little.
47. O you who were given the Book! Believe in
what We sent down, confirming what you
have, before We obliterate faces and turn
them inside out, or curse them as We cursed
the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah
is always done.
48. Allah does not forgive association with
Him, but He forgives anything less than that
to whomever He wills. Whoever associates
anything with Allah has devised a monstrous
sin.
49. Have you not considered those who claim
purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies
whom He wills, and they will not be wronged
a whit.
50. See how they devise lies against Allah. That
alone is an outright sin.
51. Have you not considered those who were
given a share of the Book? They believe in superstition and evil powers, and say of those who disbelieve, “These are better guided on
the way than the believers.”

52. Those are they whom Allah has cursed.
Whomever Allah curses, you will find no sav-
ior for him.
53. Or do they own a share of the kingdom?
Then they would not give people a speck.
54. Or do they envy the people for what Allah
has given them of His grace? We have given
the family of Abraham the Book and wisdom,
and We have given them a great kingdom.
55. Among them are those who believed in it,
and among them are those who held back
from it. Hell is a sufficient Inferno.
56. Those who reject Our revelations—We will
scorch them in a Fire. Every time their skins
are cooked, We will replace them with other
skins, so they will experience the suffering.
Allah is Most Powerful, Most Wise.
57. As for those who believe and do good
deeds, We will admit them into Gardens be-
neath which rivers flow, abiding therein for-
ever. They will have purified spouses therein,
and We will admit them into a shady shade.
58. Allah instructs you to give back things en-
trusted to you to their owners. And when you
judge between people, judge with justice. Al-
lah’s instructions to you are excellent. Allah
is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
59. O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey
the Messenger and those in authority among
you. And if you dispute over anything, refer
it to Allah and the Messenger, if you believe
in Allah and the Last Day. That is best, and a
most excellent determination.
60. Have you not observed those who claim
that they believe in what was revealed to you,
and in what was revealed before you, yet they
seek Satanic sources for legislation, in spite of
being commanded to reject them? Satan
means to mislead them far away.
61. And when it is said to them, “Come to what
Allah has revealed, and to the Messenger,”
you see the hypocrites shunning you completely.

62. How about when a disaster strikes them
because what their hands have put forward,
and then they come to you swearing by Allah:
“We only intended goodwill and reconcilia-
tion”?
63. They are those whom Allah knows what is
in their hearts. So ignore them, and admon-
ish them, and say to them concerning them-
selves penetrating words.
64. We did not send any messenger except to
be obeyed by Allah’s leave. Had they, when
they wronged themselves, come to you, and
prayed for Allah's forgiveness, and the Mes-
senger had prayed for their forgiveness, they
would have found Allah Relenting and Merciful.

65. But no, by your Lord, they will not believe
until they call you to arbitrate in their dis-
putes, and then find within themselves no re-
sentment regarding your decisions, and sub-
mit themselves completely.
66. Had We decreed for them: “Kill your-
selves,” or “Leave your homes,” they would
not have done it, except for a few of them. But
had they done what they were instructed to
do, it would have been better for them, and a
firmer confirmation.
67. And We would have given them from Our
presence a rich compensation.
68. And We would have guided them on a
straight path.
69. Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger—
these are with those whom Allah has
blessed—among the prophets, and the sin-
cere, and the martyrs, and the upright. Excel-
lent are those as companions.
70. That is the grace from Allah. Allah suffices
as Knower.
71. O you who believe! Take your precautions,
and mobilize in groups, or mobilize alto-
gether.
72. Among you is he who lags behind. Then,
when a calamity befalls you, he says, “Allah
has favored me, that I was not martyred with
them.”
73. But when some bounty from Allah comes
to you, he says—as if no affection existed be-
tween you and him—“If only I had been with
them, I would have achieved a great victory.”
74. Let those who sell the life of this world for
the Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah.
Whoever fights in the cause of Allah, and
then is killed, or achieves victory, We will
grant him a great compensation.
75. And why would you not fight in the cause
of Allah, and the helpless men, and women,
and children, cry out, “Our Lord, deliver us
from this town whose people are oppressive,
and appoint for us from Your Presence a Pro-
tector, and appoint for us from Your Pres-
ence a Victor.”
76. Those who believe fight in the cause of Al-
lah, while those who disbelieve fight in the
cause of Evil. So fight the allies of the Devil.
Surely the strategy of the Devil is weak.
77. Have you not considered those who were
told, “Restrain your hands, and perform your
prayers, and spend in regular charity”? But
when fighting was ordained for them, a fac-
tion of them feared the people as Allah is
ought to be feared, or even more. And they
said, “Our Lord, why did You ordain fighting
for us? If only You would postpone it for us
for a short while.” Say, “The enjoyments of
this life are brief, but the Hereafter is better
for the righteous, and you will not be
wronged one bit.”
78. Wherever you may be, death will catch up
with you, even if you were in fortified towers.
When a good fortune comes their way, they
say, “This is from Allah.” But when a misfor-
tune befalls them, they say, “This is from
you.” Say, “All is from Allah.” So what is the
matter with these people, that they hardly un-
derstand a thing?
79. Whatever good happens to you is from Al-
lah, and whatever bad happens to you is from
your own self. We sent you to humanity as a
messenger, and Allah is Witness enough.
80. Whoever obeys the Messenger is obeying
Allah. And whoever turns away—We did not
send you as a watcher over them.


you may find them; and do not take from
among them allies or supporters.

90. Except those who join people with whom you have a treaty, or those who come to you
reluctant to fight you or fight their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given
them power over you, and they would have fought you. If they withdraw from you, and
do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah assigns no excuse for you against them.
91. You will find others who want security from you, and security from their own people. But whenever they are tempted into civil discord, they plunge into it. So if they do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace, nor
restrain their hands, seize them and execute
them wherever you find them. Against these,
We have given you clear authorization.
92. Never should a believer kill another be-
liever, unless by error. Anyone who kills a be-
liever by error must set free a believing slave,
and pay compensation to the victim’s family,
unless they remit it as charity. If the victim
belonged to a people who are hostile to you,
but is a believer, then the compensation is to
free a believing slave. If he belonged to a peo-
ple with whom you have a treaty, then com-
pensation should be handed over to his fam-
ily, and a believing slave set free. Anyone who
lacks the means must fast for two consecutive
months, by way of repentance to Allah. Allah
is All-Knowing, Most Wise.
93. Whoever kills a believer deliberately, the
penalty for him is Hell, where he will remain
forever. And Allah will be angry with him,
and will curse him, and will prepare for him
a terrible punishment.
94. O you who believe! When you journey in
the way of Allah, investigate, and do not say
to him who offers you peace, “You are not a
believer,” aspiring for the goods of this world.
With Allah are abundant riches. You your-
selves were like this before, and Allah be-
stowed favor on you; so investigate. Allah is
well aware of what you do.
They profess obedience, but when they
leave your presence, some of them conspire
something contrary to what you said. But Al-
lah writes down what they conspire. So avoid
them, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is
Guardian enough.

82. Do they not ponder the Quran? Had it
been from any other than Allah, they would
have found in it much discrepancy.
83. When some news of security or alarm
comes their way, they broadcast it. But had
they referred it to the Messenger, and to those
in authority among them, those who can
draw conclusions from it would have com-
prehended it. Were it not for Allah’s blessing
and mercy upon you, you would have followed the Devil, except for a few.

84. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are re-
sponsible only for yourself. And rouse the be-
lievers. Perhaps Allah will restrain the might
of those who disbelieve. Allah is Stronger in
Might, and More Punishing.
85. Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a
share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil
cause shares in its burdens. Allah keeps watch
over everything.
86. When you are greeted with a greeting, re-
spond with a better greeting, or return it. Al-
lah keeps count of everything.
87. Allah—there is no god except He. He will
gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in
which there is no doubt. And who speaks
more truly than Allah?
88. What is the matter with you, divided into
two factions regarding the hypocrites, when
Allah Himself has overwhelmed them on ac-
count of what they did? Do you want to guide
those whom Allah has led astray? Whomever
Allah leads astray—you will never find for
him a way.
89. They would love to see you disbelieve, just
as they disbelieve, so you would become
equal. So do not befriend any of them, unless
they emigrate in the way of Allah. If they turn
away, seize them and execute them wherever
81.


or are sick, by putting down your weapons;
but take precautions. Indeed, Allah has pre-
pared for the disbelievers a demeaning pun-
ishment.

103. When you have completed the prayer, re-
member Allah, standing, or sitting, or on
your sides. And when you feel secure, per-
form the prayer. The prayer is obligatory for
believers at specific times.
104. And do not falter in the pursuit of the en-
emy. If you are aching, they are aching as you
are aching, but you expect from Allah what
they cannot expect. Allah is Knowledgeable
and Wise.
105. We have revealed to you the Scripture,
with the truth, so that you judge between
people in accordance with what Allah has
shown you. And do not be an advocate for the
traitors.
106. And ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah is
Forgiver and Merciful.
107. And do not argue on behalf of those who
deceive themselves. Allah does not love the
deceitful sinner.
108. They hide from the people, but they can-
not hide from Allah. He is with them, as they
plot by night with words He does not ap-
prove. Allah comprehends what they do.
109. There you are, arguing on their behalf in
the present life, but who will argue with Allah
on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection?
Or who will be their representative?
110. Whoever commits evil, or wrongs his soul,
then implores Allah for forgiveness, will find
Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
111. And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against
himself. Allah is Aware and Wise.
112. And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin,
and then blames it on an innocent person,
has taken a slander and a clear sin.
113. Were it not for Allah’s grace towards you,
and His mercy, a faction of them would have
managed to mislead you. But they only mislead themselves, and they cannot harm you in
Not equal are the inactive among the believers—except the disabled—and the strivers in the cause of Allah with their possessions and their persons. Allah prefers the
strivers with their possessions and their persons above the inactive, by a degree. But Allah has promised goodness to both. Yet Allah
favors the strivers, over the inactive, with a great reward.


96. Degrees from Him, and forgiveness, and
mercy. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
97. While the angels are removing the souls of
those who have wronged themselves, they
will say, “What was the matter with you?”
They will say, “We were oppressed in the
land.” They will say, “Was Allah’s earth not
vast enough for you to emigrate in it?”
These—their refuge is Hell. What a wretched
retreat!
98. Except for the weak among men, and
women, and children who have no means to
act, and no means to find a way out.
99. These—Allah may well pardon them. Allah
is Pardoning and Forgiving.
100. Anyone who emigrates for the sake of Al-
lah will find on earth many places of refuge,
and plentitude. Anyone who leaves his home,
emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and
then is overtaken by death, his compensation
falls on Allah. Allah is Forgiver, Most Merci-
ful.
101. When you travel in the land, there is no
blame on you for shortening the prayers, if
you fear that the disbelievers may harm you.
The disbelievers are your manifest enemies.
102. When you are among them, and you stand
to lead them in prayer, let a group of them
stand with you, and let them hold their weap-
ons. Then, when they have done their pros-
trations, let them withdraw to the rear, and
let another group, that have not prayed yet,
come forward and pray with you; and let
them take their precautions and their weap-
ons. Those who disbelieve would like you to
neglect your weapons and your equipment,
so they can attack you in a single assault. You
commit no error, if you are hampered by rain
95.


any way. Allah has revealed to you the Scripture and wisdom, and has taught you what you did not know. Allah’s goodness towards you is great.

114. There is no good in much of their private
counsels, except for him who advocates char-
ity, or kindness, or reconciliation between
people. Whoever does that, seeking Allah’s
approval, We will give him a great compen-
sation.
115. Whoever makes a breach with the Messen-
ger, after the guidance has become clear to
him, and follows other than the path of the
believers, We will direct him in the direction
he has chosen, and commit him to Hell—
what a terrible destination!
116. Allah will not forgive that partners be as-
sociated with Him; but will forgive anything
less than that, to whomever He wills. Anyone
who ascribes partners to Allah has strayed
into far error.
117. They invoke in His stead only females. In
fact, they invoke none but a rebellious devil.
118. Allah has cursed him. And he said, “I will
take to myself my due share of Your serv-
ants.”
119. “And I will mislead them, and I will entice
them, and I will prompt them to slit the ears
of cattle, and I will prompt them to alter the
creation of Allah.” Whoever takes Satan as a
lord, instead of Allah, has surely suffered a
profound loss.
120. He promises them, and he raises their ex-
pectations, but Satan promises them nothing
but delusions.
121. These—their place is Hell, and they will
find no escape from it.
122. But as for those who believe and do right-
eous deeds, We will admit them into gardens
beneath which rivers flow, where they will
abide forever. The promise of Allah is true—
and who is more truthful in speech than Al-
lah?
It is not in accordance with your wishes,
nor in accordance with the wishes of the Peo-
ple of the Scripture. Whoever works evil will
pay for it, and will not find for himself, be-
sides Allah, any protector or savior.

124. But whoever works righteousness,
whether male or female, and is a believer—
those will enter Paradise, and will not be
wronged a whit.
125. And who is better in religion than he who
submits himself wholly to Allah, and is a doer
of good, and follows the faith of Abraham the
Monotheist? Allah has chosen Abraham for a
friend.
126. To Allah belongs what is in the heavens
and what is on earth, and Allah encompasses
everything.
127. They ask you for a ruling about women.
Say, “Allah gives you a ruling about them,
and so does what is stated to you in the Book
about widowed women from whom you
withhold what is decreed for them, yet you
desire to marry them, and about helpless chil-
dren: that you should treat the orphans
fairly.” Whatever good you do, Allah knows
it.
128. If a woman fears maltreatment or deser-
tion from her husband, there is no fault in
them if they reconcile their differences, for
reconciliation is best. Souls are prone to ava-
rice; yet if you do what is good, and practice
piety—Allah is Cognizant of what you do.
129. You will not be able to treat women with
equal fairness, no matter how much you de-
sire it. But do not be so biased as to leave an-
other suspended. If you make amends, and
act righteously—Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.
130. And if they separate, Allah will enrich each
from His abundance. Allah is Bounteous and
Wise.
131. To Allah belongs everything in the heav-
ens and everything on earth. We have in-
structed those who were given the Book be-
fore you, and you, to be conscious of Allah.
123.

they say, “Did we not side with you, and de-
fend you from the believers?” Allah will judge
between you on the Day of Resurrection; and
Allah will give the disbelievers no means of
overcoming the believers.

142. The hypocrites try to deceive Allah, but He
is deceiving them. And when they stand for
prayer, they stand lazily, showing off in front
of people, and remembering Allah only a lit-
tle.
143. Wavering in between, neither with these,
nor with those. Whomever Allah sends
astray, you will never find for him a way.
144. O you who believe! Do not befriend disbe-
lievers rather than believers. Do you want to
give Allah a clear case against you?
145. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level
of the Fire, and you will find no helper for
them.
146. Except those who repent, and reform, and
hold fast to Allah, and dedicate their religion
to Allah alone. These are with the believers;
and Allah will give the believers a great re-
ward.
147. What would Allah accomplish by your
punishment, if you have given thanks, and
have believed? Allah is Appreciative and
Cognizant.
148. Allah does not like the public uttering of
bad language, unless someone was wronged.
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
149. If you let a good deed be shown, or conceal
it, or pardon an offense—Allah is Pardoning
and Capable.
150. Those who disbelieve in Allah and His
messengers, and want to separate between
Allah and His messengers, and say, “We be-
lieve in some, and reject some,” and wish to
take a path in between.
151. These are the unbelievers, truly. We have
prepared for the unbelievers a shameful punishment.

But if you refuse—to Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth.
Allah is in no need, Praiseworthy. 

132. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. Allah suffices as
Manager.

133. If He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring others. Allah is Able to do that.

134. Whoever desires the reward of this
world—with Allah is the reward of this world
and the next. Allah is All-Hearing, All-See-
ing.
135. O you who believe! Stand firmly for jus-
tice, as witnesses to Allah, even if against
yourselves, or your parents, or your relatives.
Whether one is rich or poor, Allah takes care
of both. So do not follow your desires, lest
you swerve. If you deviate, or turn away—
then Allah is Aware of what you do.
136. O you who believe! Believe in Allah and
His messenger, and the Book He sent down
to His messenger, and the Book He sent
down before. Whoever rejects Allah, His an-
gels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last
Day, has strayed far in error.
137. Those who believe, then disbelieve, then
believe, then disbelieve, then increase in dis-
belief, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He
guide them to a way.
138. Inform the hypocrites that they will have a
painful punishment.
139. Those who ally themselves with the disbe-
lievers instead of the believers. Do they seek
glory in them? All glory belongs to Allah.
140. He has revealed to you in the Book that
when you hear Allah’s revelations being re-
jected, or ridiculed, do not sit with them until
they engage in some other subject. Other-
wise, you would be like them. Allah will
gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers,
into Hell, altogether.
141. Those who lie in wait for you: if you attain
victory from Allah, they say, “Were we not
with you?” But if the disbelievers get a turn,




152. As for those who believe in Allah and His
messengers, and make no distinction be-
tween any of them—He will give them their
rewards. Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.
153. The People of the Scripture challenge you
to bring down to them a book from the sky.
They had asked Moses for something even
greater. They said, “Show us Allah plainly.”
The thunderbolt struck them for their wick-
edness. Then they took the calf for worship,
even after the clear proofs had come to them.
Yet We pardoned that, and We gave Moses a
clear authority.
154. And We raised the Mount above them in
accordance with their covenant, and We said
to them, “Enter the gate humbly”, and We
said to them, “Do not violate the Sabbath”,
and We received from them a solemn pledge.
155. But for their violation of their covenant,
and their denial of Allah’s revelations, and
their killing of the prophets unjustly, and
their saying, “Our minds are closed.” In fact,
Allah has sealed them for their disbelief, so
they do not believe, except for a few.
156. And for their faithlessness, and their say-
ing against Mary a monstrous slander.
157. And for their saying, “We have killed the
Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messen-
ger of Allah.” In fact, they did not kill him,
nor did they crucify him, but it appeared to
them as if they did. Indeed, those who differ
about him are in doubt about it. They have
no knowledge of it, except the following of as-
sumptions. Certainly, they did not kill him.
158. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself.
Allah is Mighty and Wise.
159. There is none from the People of the
Scripture but will believe in him before his
death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will
be a witness against them.
160. Due to wrongdoing on the part of the Jews, We forbade them good things that used
to be lawful for them; and for deterring many from Allah’s path.
161. And for their taking usury, although they were forbidden it; and for their consuming people's wealth dishonestly. We have prepared for the faithless among them a painful torment.

162. But those among them firmly rooted in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what
was revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you; and the observers of prayers, and
the givers of charity, and the believers in Allah and the Last Day—upon these We will be-
stow an immense reward.

163. We have inspired you, as We had inspired Noah and the prophets after him. And We in-
spired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job,
and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon. And We gave David the Psalms.
164. Some messengers We have already told you about, while some messengers We have
not told you about. And Allah spoke to Moses directly.
165. Messengers delivering good news, and bringing warnings; so that people may have
no excuse before Allah after the coming of the messengers. Allah is Powerful and Wise.
166. But Allah bears witness to what He revealed to you. He revealed it with His
knowledge. And the angels bear witness. Though Allah is a sufficient witness.
167. Those who disbelieve and repel from Al-
lah’s path have gone far astray.
168. Those who disbelieve and transgress; Al-
lah is not about to forgive them, nor will He
guide them to any path.
169. Except to the path of Hell, where they will
dwell forever. And that is easy for Allah.
170. O people! The Messenger has come to you
with the truth from your Lord, so believe—
that is best for you. But if you disbelieve, to
Allah belongs everything in the heavens and
the earth. Allah is Omniscient and Wise.
171. O People of the Scripture! Do not exagger-
ate in your religion, and do not say about Al-
lah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the
son of Mary, is the Messenger of Allah, and
His Word that He conveyed to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His
messengers, and do not say, “Three.” Refrain—it is better for you. Allah is only one
God. Glory be to Him—that He should have
a son. To Him belongs everything in the
heavens and the earth, and Allah is a suffi-
cient Protector.


172. The Messiah does not disdain to be a serv-
ant of Allah, nor do the favored angels. Who-
ever disdains His worship, and is too arro-
gant—He will round them up to Himself al-
together.
173. But as for those who believe and do good
works, He will pay them their wages in full,
and will increase His grace for them. But as
for those who disdain and are too proud, He
will punish them with an agonizing punish-
ment. And they will find for themselves,
apart from Allah, no lord and no savior.
174. O people! A proof has come to you from
your Lord, and We sent down to you a clear
light.
175. As for those who believe in Allah, and hold
fast to Him, He will admit them into mercy
and grace from Him, and will guide them to
Himself in a straight path.
176. They ask you for a ruling. Say, “Allah gives
you a ruling concerning the person who has
neither parents nor children.” If a man dies,
and leaves no children, and he had a sister,
she receives one-half of what he leaves. And
he inherits from her if she leaves no children.
But if there are two sisters, they receive two-
thirds of what he leaves. If the siblings are
men and women, the male receives the share
of two females.” Allah makes things clear for
you, lest you err. Allah is Aware of every-
thing.
