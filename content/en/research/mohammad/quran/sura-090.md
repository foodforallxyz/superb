## 91. THE SUN (ash-Shams)

By: 
- the sun and its radiance.
- the moon as it follows it.
- the day
- the night
- the sky
- the earth
- the soul and He who proportioned it and inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness,

{{< s v="9-10">}} He who:
- purifies his soul has succeeded 
- corrupts his soul has failed. 

{{< s v="11-12">}} Tham´d denied their prophet by reason of their transgression, when the most wretched of them was sent forth.

{{< s v="13">}} Salih, the messenger of Allah, said to them: "Do not harm the she-camel of Allah or [prevent her from] her drink."

14. But they denied him and hamstrung 1804 her. So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it
equal [upon all of them].

15. And He does not fear the consequence thereof.
