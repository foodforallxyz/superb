<!-- 1. Glorifying Allah is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the
Wise. -->
2. To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes
death, and He has power over all things. 

3. He is the First and the Last, and the Outer and the Inner, and He has knowledge of all things.

4. It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then settled over the
Throne. He knows what penetrates into the earth, and what comes out of it, and what descends from the sky, and what ascends to it.

And He is with you wherever you may be. Allah is Seeing of everything you do.

5. To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah all matters are referred.

6. He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night; and He knows
what the hearts contains.

7. Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and spend from what He made you inherit. Those
among you who believe and give will have a great reward.

8. What is the matter with you that you do not believe in Allah, when the Messenger calls
you to believe in your Lord, and He has received a pledge from you, if you are believers?
9. It is He who sends down upon His servant clear revelations, to bring you out of darkness
into the light. Allah is Gentle towards you, Most Compassionate.

10. And why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when to Allah belongs the in-
heritance of the heavens and the earth? Not equal among you are those who contributed
before the conquest, and fought. Those are higher in rank than those who contributed
afterwards, and fought. But Allah promises both a good reward. <!-- Allah is Well Experi-enced in what you do. -->

11. Who is he who will lend Allah a loan of
goodness, that He may double it for him, and
will have a generous reward?
12. On the Day when you see the believing
men and believing women—their light radi-
ating ahead of them, and to their right: “Good
news for you today: gardens beneath which
rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is
the great triumph.”
13. On the Day when the hypocritical men and
hypocritical women will say to those who be-
lieved, “Wait for us; let us absorb some of
your light.” It will be said, “Go back behind
you, and seek light.” A wall will be raised be-
tween them, in which is a door; within it is
mercy, and outside it is agony.
14. They will call to them, “Were we not with
you?” They will say, “Yes, but you cheated
your souls, and waited, and doubted, and be-
came deluded by wishful thinking, until the
command of Allah arrived; and arrogance
deceived you regarding Allah.”
15. “Therefore, today no ransom will be ac-
cepted from you, nor from those who disbe-
lieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your com-
panion—what an evil fate!”
16. Is it not time for those who believe to sur-
render their hearts to the remembrance of Al-
lah, and to the truth that has come down, and
not be like those who were given the Book
previously, but time became prolonged for
them, so their hearts hardened, and many of
them are sinners?
17. Know that Allah revives the earth after its
death. We thus explain the revelations for
you, so that you may understand.
18. The charitable men and charitable women,
who have loaned Allah a loan of righteous-
ness—it will be multiplied for them, and for
them is a generous reward.
19. Those who believe in Allah and His mes-
sengers—these are the sincere and the wit-
20958. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)
nesses with their Lord; they will have their re-
ward and their light. But as for those who dis-
believe and deny Our revelations—these are
the inmates of the Blaze.
20. Know that the worldly life is only play, and
distraction, and glitter, and boasting among
you, and rivalry in wealth and children. It is
like a rainfall that produces plants, and de-
lights the disbelievers. But then it withers,
and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes
debris. While in the Hereafter there is severe
agony, and forgiveness from Allah, and ac-
ceptance. The life of this world is nothing but
enjoyment of vanity.
21. Race towards forgiveness from your Lord;
and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the
earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah
and His messengers. That is the grace of Al-
lah; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Al-
lah is the Possessor of Immense Grace.
22. No calamity occurs on earth, or in your
souls, but it is in a Book, even before We
make it happen. That is easy for Allah.
23. That you may not sorrow over what eludes
you, nor exult over what He has given you.
Allah does not love the proud snob.
24. Those who are stingy, and induce people to
be stingy. Whoever turns away—Allah is the
Independent, the Praiseworthy.
25. We sent Our messengers with the clear
proofs, and We sent down with them the
Book and the Balance, that humanity may
uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in
which is violent force, and benefits for hu-
manity. That Allah may know who supports
Him and His messengers invisibly. Allah is
Strong and Powerful.
26. We sent Noah and Abraham, and estab-
lished in their line Prophethood and the
Scripture. Some of them are guided, but
many of them are sinners.
27. Then We sent in their wake Our messen-
gers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary,
and We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in
the hearts of those who followed him com-
passion and mercy. But as for the monasti-
cism which they invented—We did not or-
dain it for them—only to seek Allah’s ap-
proval. But they did not observe it with its
due observance. So We gave those of them
who believed their reward, but many of them
are sinful.
28. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and believe
in His Messenger: He will give you a double
portion of His mercy, and will give you a light
by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
29. That the People of the Book may know that
they have no power whatsoever over Allah’s
grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand; He
gives it to whomever He wills. Allah is Pos-
sessor of Great Grace.
58. THE ARGUMENT
(al-Mujadilah)

1. Allah has heard the statement of she who
argued with you concerning her husband, as
she complained to Allah. Allah heard your
conversation. Allah is Hearing and Seeing.
2. Those of you who estrange their wives by
equating them with their mothers—they are
not their mothers. Their mothers are none
else but those who gave birth to them. What
they say is evil, and a blatant lie. But Allah is
Pardoning and Forgiving.
3. Those who estrange their wives by equating
them with their mothers, then go back on
what they said, must set free a slave before
they may touch one another. To this you are
exhorted, and Allah is well aware of what you
do.
4. But whoever cannot find the means must
fast for two consecutive months before they
may touch one another. And if he is unable,
then the feeding of sixty needy people. This,
in order that you affirm your faith in Allah
and His Messenger. These are the ordinances
21058. THE ARGUMENT (al-Mujadilah)
of Allah. The unbelievers will have a painful
punishment.
5. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen-
ger will be subdued, as those before them
were subdued. We have revealed clear mes-
sages. The unbelievers will have a demeaning
punishment.
6. On the Day when Allah resurrects them all,
and informs them of what they did. Allah has
kept count of it, but they have forgotten it.
Allah is Witness over everything.
7. Do you not realize that Allah knows every-
thing in the heavens and everything on earth?
There is no secret counsel between three, but
He is their fourth; nor between five, but He is
their sixth; nor less than that, nor more, but
He is with them wherever they may be. Then,
on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform
them of what they did. Allah has knowledge
of everything.
8. Have you noted those who were prohibited
from conspiring secretly, but then reverted to
what they were prohibited from? They con-
spire to commit sin, and aggression, and de-
fiance of the Messenger. And when they
come to you, they greet you with a greeting
that Allah never greeted you with. And they
say within themselves, “Why does Allah not
punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough
for them. They will roast in it. What a miser-
able destiny!
9. O you who believe! When you converse se-
cretly, do not converse in sin, and aggression,
and disobedience of the Messenger; but con-
verse in virtue and piety; And fear Allah, to
Whom you will be gathered.
10. Conspiracies are from Satan, that he may
dishearten those who believe; but he will not
harm them in the least, except by leave of Al-
lah. So let the believers put their trust in Al-
lah.
11. O you who believe! When you are told to
make room in your gatherings, make room;
Allah will make room for you. And when you
are told to disperse, disperse. Allah elevates
those among you who believe, and those
given knowledge, many steps. Allah is Aware
of what you do.
12. O you who believe! When you converse
privately with the Messenger, offer some-
thing in charity before your conversation.
That is better for you, and purer. But if you
do not find the means—Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.
13. Are you reluctant to offer charity before
your conversation? If you do not do so, and
Allah pardons you, then perform the prayer,
and give alms, and obey Allah and His Mes-
senger. Allah is Aware of what you do.
14. Have you considered those who befriended
a people with whom Allah has become angry?
They are not of you, nor of them. And they
swear to a lie while they know.
15. Allah has prepared for them a terrible pun-
ishment. Evil is what they used to do.
16. They took their oaths as a screen, and pre-
vented others from Allah’s path. They will
have a shameful punishment.
17. Neither their possessions nor their chil-
dren will avail them anything against Allah.
These are the inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling
therein forever.
18. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them
altogether—they will swear to Him, as they
swear to you, thinking that they are upon
something. Indeed, they themselves are the
liars.
19. Satan has taken hold of them, and so has
caused them to forget the remembrance of
Allah. These are the partisans of Satan. In-
deed, it is Satan’s partisans who are the losers.
20. Those who oppose Allah and His Messen-
ger are among the lowliest.
21. Allah has written: “I will certainly prevail, I
and My messengers.” Allah is Strong and
Mighty.
22. You will not find a people who believe in
Allah and the Last Day, loving those who op-
pose Allah and His Messenger, even if they
were their parents, or their children, or their
siblings, or their close relatives. These—He
21159. THE MOBILIZATION (al-Hashr)
has inscribed faith in their hearts, and has
supported them with a spirit from Him. And
He will admit them into Gardens beneath
which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell
forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they
are pleased with Him. These are the partisans
of Allah. Indeed, it is Allah’s partisans who
are the successful.
59. THE MOBILIZATION
(al-Hashr)

1. Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heav-
ens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the
Most Wise.
2. It is He who evicted those who disbelieved
among the People of the Book from their
homes at the first mobilization. You did not
think they would leave, and they thought
their fortresses would protect them from Al-
lah. But Allah came at them from where they
never expected, and threw terror into their
hearts. They wrecked their homes with their
own hands, and by the hands of the believers.
Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have in-
sight.
3. Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He
would have punished them in this life. But in
the Hereafter they will have the punishment
of the Fire.
4. That is because they opposed Allah and His
Messenger. Whoever opposes Allah—Allah
is stern in retribution.
5. Whether you cut down a tree, or leave it
standing on its trunk, it is by Allah’s will. He
will surely disgrace the sinners.
6. Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His
Messenger from them; you spurred neither
horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives au-
thority to His messengers over whomever He
will. Allah is Able to do all things.
7. Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger
from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to
Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the rela-
tives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and
to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate
solely between the wealthy among you.
Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it;
and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it.
And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punish-
ment.
8. To the poor refugees who were driven out
of their homes and their possessions, as they
sought the favor of Allah and His approval,
and came to the aid of Allah and His Messen-
ger. These are the sincere.
9. And those who, before them, had settled in
the homeland, and had accepted faith. They
love those who emigrated to them, and find
no hesitation in their hearts in helping them.
They give them priority over themselves,
even if they themselves are needy. Whoever
is protected from his natural greed—it is they
who are the successful.
10. And those who came after them, saying,
“Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who
preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in
our hearts towards those who believe. Our
Lord, You are Clement and Merciful.”
11. Have you not considered those who act
hypocritically? They say to their brethren
who disbelieved among the People of the
Book, “If you are evicted, we will leave with
you, and will not obey anyone against you;
and should anyone fight you, we will cer-
tainly support you.” But Allah bears witness
that they are liars.
12. If they are evicted, they will not leave with
them; and if anyone fights them, they will not
support them; and if they go to their aid, they
will turn their backs and flee; then they will
receive no support.
13. Fear of you is more intense in their hearts
than fear of Allah. That is because they are a
people who do not understand.
14. They will not fight you all together except
from fortified strongholds, or from behind
walls. Their hostility towards each other is se-
vere. You would think they are united, but
21260. THE WOMAN TESTED (al-Mumtahina)
their hearts are diverse. That is because they
are a people who do not understand.
15. Like those shortly before them. They expe-
rienced the consequences of their decisions.
For them is a painful punishment.
16. Like the devil, when he says to the human
being, “Disbelieve.” But when he has disbe-
lieved, he says, “I am innocent of you; I fear
Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.”
17. The ultimate end for both of them is the
Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the
requital for the wrongdoers.
18. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let
every soul consider what it has forwarded for
the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of
what you do.
19. And do not be like those who forgot Allah,
so He made them forget themselves. These
are the sinners.
20. Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire
and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the in-
habitants of Paradise who are the winners.
21. Had We sent this Quran down on a moun-
tain, you would have seen it trembling, crum-
bling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite
for the people, so that they may reflect.
22. He is Allah. There is no god but He, the
Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the
Compassionate, the Merciful.
23. He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god;
the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the
Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the
Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to
Allah, beyond what they associate.
24. He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the De-
signer. His are the Most Beautiful Names.
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glo-
rifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise.
60. THE WOMAN TESTED
(al-Mumtahina)

1. O you who believe! Do not take My enemies
and your enemies for supporters, offering
them affection, when they have disbelieved in
what has come to you of the Truth. They have
expelled the Messenger, and you, because you
believed in Allah, your Lord. If you have mo-
bilized to strive for My cause, seeking My ap-
proval, how can you secretly love them? I
know what you conceal and what you reveal.
Whoever among you does that has strayed
from the right way.
2. Whenever they encounter you, they treat
you as enemies, and they stretch their hands
and tongues against you with malice. They
wish that you would disbelieve.
3. Neither your relatives nor your children
will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection.
He will separate between you. Allah is Ob-
servant of what you do.
4. You have had an excellent example in Abra-
ham and those with him; when they said to
their people, “We are quit of you, and what
you worship apart from Allah. We denounce
you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between
us and you, forever, until you believe in Allah
alone.” Except for the words of Abraham to
his father, “I will ask forgiveness for you,
though I have no power from Allah to do an-
ything for you.” “Our Lord, in You we trust,
and to You we repent, and to You is the ulti-
mate resort.
5. Our Lord, do not make us a target for those
who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You
are indeed the Mighty and Wise.”
6. There is an excellent example in them for
you—for anyone who seeks Allah and the
Last Day. But whoever turns away—Allah is
the Self-Sufficient, the Most Praised.
7. Perhaps Allah will plant affection between
you and those of them you consider enemies.
Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Mer-
ciful.
8. As for those who have not fought against
you for your religion, nor expelled you from
your homes, Allah does not prohibit you
from dealing with them kindly and equitably.
Allah loves the equitable.
21361. COLUMN (as-Saff)
9. But Allah prohibits you from befriending
those who fought against you over your reli-
gion, and expelled you from your homes, and
aided in your expulsion. Whoever takes them
for friends—these are the wrongdoers.
10. O you who believe! When believing
women come to you emigrating, test them.
Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find
them to be faithful, do not send them back to
the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them,
nor are they lawful for them. But give them
what they have spent. You are not at fault if
you marry them, provided you give them
their compensation. And do not hold on to
ties with unbelieving women, but demand
what you have spent, and let them demand
what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah;
He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and
Wise.
11. If any of your wives desert you to the unbe-
lievers, and you decide to penalize them, give
those whose wives have gone away the equiv-
alent of what they had spent. And fear Allah,
in whom you are believers.
12. O prophet! If believing women come to
you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition
that they will not associate anything with Al-
lah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill
their children, nor commit perjury as to
parenthood, nor disobey you in anything
righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Al-
lah’s forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving
and Merciful.
13. O you who believe! Do not befriend people
with whom Allah has become angry, and
have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faith-
less have despaired of the occupants of the
graves.
61. COLUMN
(as-Saff)

Everything in the heavens and the earth
praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise.
1.
O you who believe! Why do you say what
you do not do?
3. It is most hateful to Allah that you say what
you do not do.
4. Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in
ranks, as though they were a compact struc-
ture.
5. When Moses said to his people, “O my peo-
ple, why do you hurt me, although you know
that I am Allah’s Messenger to you?” And
when they swerved, Allah swerved their
hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people.
6. And when Jesus son of Mary said, “O Chil-
dren of Israel, I am Allah’s Messenger to you,
confirming what preceded me of the Torah,
and announcing good news of a messenger
who will come after me, whose name is Ah-
mad.” But when he showed them the mira-
cles, they said, “This is obvious sorcery.”
7. And who is a greater wrongdoer than he
who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he
is being invited to Islam? Allah does not
guide the wrongdoing people.
8. They want to extinguish Allah’s Light with
their mouths; but Allah will complete His
Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it.
9. It is He who sent His Messenger with the
guidance and the true religion, to make it
prevail over all religions, even though the
idolaters dislike it.
10. O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a
trade that will save you from a painful tor-
ment?
11. That you believe in Allah and His Messen-
ger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your
possessions and yourselves. That is best for
you, if you only knew.
12. He will forgive you your sins; and will ad-
mit you into gardens beneath which rivers
flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gar-
dens of Eden. That is the supreme success.
13. And something else you love: support from
Allah, and imminent victory. So give good
news to the believers.
2.
21462. FRIDAY (al-Jumu’ah)
14. O
you who believe! Be supporters of Allah,
as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples,
“Who are my supporters towards Allah?”
The disciples said, “We are Allah's support-
ers.” So a group of the Children of Israel be-
lieved, while another group disbelieved. We
supported those who believed against their
foe, so they became dominant.
62. FRIDAY
(al-Jumu’ah)

9. O you who believe! When the call is made
for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to
the remembrance of Allah, and drop all busi-
ness. That is better for you, if you only knew.
10. Then, when the prayer is concluded, dis-
perse through the land, and seek Allah’s
bounty, and remember Allah much, so that
you may prosper.
11. Yet whenever they come across some busi-
ness, or some entertainment, they scramble
towards it, and leave you standing. Say,
“What is with Allah is better than entertain-
ment and business; and Allah is the Best of
providers.”
1. Everything in the heavens and the earth glo-
rifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Al-
mighty, the Wise.
2. It is He who sent among the unlettered a
messenger from themselves; reciting His rev-
elations to them, and purifying them, and
teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; alt-
hough they were in obvious error before that.
3. And others from them, who have not yet
joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise.
4. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to
whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of lim-
itless grace.
5. The example of those who were entrusted
with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it,
is like the donkey carrying works of litera-
ture. Miserable is the example of the people
who denounce Allah’s revelations. Allah does
not guide the wrongdoing people.
6. Say, “O you who follow Judaism; if you
claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclu-
sion of the rest of mankind, then wish for
death if you are sincere.”
7. But they will not wish for it, ever, due to
what their hands have advanced. Allah knows
well the wrongdoers.
8. Say, “The death from which you flee will
catch up with you; then you will be returned
to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible,
and He will inform you of what you used to
do.”
63. THE HYPOCRITES
(al-Munafiqun)

1. When
the hypocrites come to you, they say,
“We bear witness that you are Allah’s Mes-
senger.” Allah knows that you are His Mes-
senger, and Allah bears witness that the hyp-
ocrites are liars.
2. They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they
repel others from Allah’s path. Evil is what
they do.
3. That is because they believed, and then dis-
believed; so their hearts were sealed, and they
cannot understand.
4. When you see them, their appearance im-
presses you. And when they speak, you listen
to what they say. They are like propped-up
timber. They think every shout is aimed at
them. They are the enemy, so beware of them.
Allah condemns them; how deluded they are!
5. And when it is said to them, “Come, the
Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for
you,” they bend their heads, and you see them
turning away arrogantly.
6. It is the same for them, whether you ask for-
giveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness
for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah
does not guide the sinful people.
21564. GATHERING (at-Taghabun)
7. It is they who say: “Do not spend anything
on those who side with Allah’s Messenger,
unless they have dispersed.” To Allah belong
the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but
the hypocrites do not understand.
8. They say, “If we return to the City, the more
powerful therein will evict the weak.” But
power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger,
and the believers; but the hypocrites do not
know.
9. O you who believe! Let neither your posses-
sions nor your children distract you from the
remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that—
these are the losers.
10. And give from what We have provided for
you, before death approaches one of you, and
he says, “My Lord, if only You would delay
me for a short while, so that I may be charita-
ble, and be one of the righteous.”
11. But Allah will not delay a soul when its time
has come. Allah is Informed of what you do.
64. GATHERING
(at-Taghabun)

Everything in the heavens and the earth
praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom,
and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able
to do all things.
2. It is He who created you. Some of you are
unbelievers, and some of you are believers.
And Allah perceives what you do.
3. He created the heavens and the earth with
truth, and He designed you, and designed
you well, and to Him is the final return.
4. He knows everything in the heavens and the
earth, and He knows what you conceal and
what you reveal. And Allah knows what is
within the hearts.
5. Has the news not reached you, of those who
disbelieved before? They tasted the ill conse-
quences of their conduct, and a painful tor-
ment awaits them.
1.
6. That is because their messengers came to
them with clear explanations, but they said,
“Are human beings going to guide us?” So
they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah
is in no need. Allah is Independent and
Praiseworthy.
7. Those who disbelieve claim that they will
not be resurrected. Say, “Yes indeed, by my
Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be
informed of everything you did; and that is
easy for Allah.”
8. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and
the Light which We sent down. Allah is
Aware of everything you do.
9. The Day when He gathers you for the Day
of Gathering—that is the Day of Mutual Ex-
change. Whoever believes in Allah and acts
with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds,
and will admit him into gardens beneath
which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever.
That is the supreme achievement.
10. But as for those who disbelieve and de-
nounce Our revelations—these are the in-
mates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever;
and what a miserable fate!
11. No disaster occurs except by Allah’s leave.
Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his
heart. Allah is Aware of everything.
12. So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But
if you turn away—it is only incumbent on
Our Messenger to deliver the clear message.
13. Allah, there is no god but He; and in Allah
let the believers put their trust.
14. O you who believe! Among your wives and
your children are enemies to you, so beware
of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and
forgive—Allah is Forgiver and Merciful.
15. Your possessions and your children are a
test, but with Allah is a splendid reward.
16. So be conscious of Allah as much as you
can, and listen, and obey, and give for your
own good. He who is protected from his stin-
giness—these are the prosperous.
21665. DIVORCE (at-Talaq)
17. If
you lend Allah a good loan, He will mul-
tiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is
Appreciative and Forbearing.
18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen,
the Almighty, the Wise.
65. DIVORCE
(at-Talaq)

1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di-
vorce them during their period of purity, and
calculate their term. And be pious before Al-
lah, your Lord. And do not evict them from
their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they
have committed a proven adultery. These are
the limits of Allah—whoever oversteps Al-
lah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You
never know; Allah may afterwards bring
about a new situation.
2. Once they have reached their term, either
retain them honorably, or separate from
them honorably. And call to witness two just
people from among you, and give upright tes-
timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever
believes in Allah and the Last Day. And who-
ever fears Allah—He will make a way out for
him.
3. And will provide for him from where he
never expected. Whoever relies on Allah—
He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His
purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.
4. As for those of your women who have
reached menopause, if you have any doubts,
their term shall be three months—and also
for those who have not menstruated. As for
those who are pregnant, their term shall be
until they have delivered. Whoever fears Al-
lah—He will make things easy for him.
5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He
sent down to you. Whoever fears Allah—He
will remit his sins, and will amplify his re-
ward.
6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac-
cording to your means, and do not harass
them in order to make things difficult for
them. If they are pregnant, spend on them
until they give birth. And if they nurse your
infant, give them their payment. And con-
duct your relation in amity. But if you disa-
gree, then let another woman nurse him.
7. The wealthy shall spend according to his
means; and he whose resources are restricted
shall spend according to what Allah has given
him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what
He has given it. Allah will bring ease after
hardship.
8. How many a town defied the command of
its Lord and His messengers? So We held it
strictly accountable, and We punished it with
a dreadful punishment.
9. It tasted the result of its decisions, and the
outcome of its decisions was perdition.
10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri-
bution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos-
sess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent
down to you a Reminder.
11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s
Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring
those who believe and work righteousness
from darkness into light. Whoever believes in
Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit
him into gardens beneath which rivers flow,
therein to abide forever. Allah has given him
an excellent provision.
12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens,
and their like of earth. The command de-
scends through them, so that you may know
that Allah is Capable of everything, and that
Allah Encompasses everything in knowledge.
66. PROHIBITION
(at-Tahrim)

1. O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah
has permitted for you, seeking to please your
wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
21767. SOVEREIGNTY (al-Mulk)
2. Allah
has decreed for you the dissolution of
your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the
All-Knowing, the Most Wise.
3. The Prophet told something in confidence
to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it,
and Allah made it known to him; he commu-
nicated part of it, and he avoided another
part. Then, when he informed her of it, she
said, “Who informed you of this?” He said,
“The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, in-
formed me.”
4. If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have
listened. But if you band together against
him, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and
the righteous believers. In addition, the an-
gels will assist him.
5. Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will
give him in exchange wives better than you:
submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, de-
vout, fasting—previously married, or virgins.
6. O you who believe! Protect yourselves and
your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people
and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and pow-
erful. They never disobey Allah in anything
He commands them, and they carry out
whatever they are commanded.
7. O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses
today. You are being repaid for what you
used to do.
8. O you who believe! Repent to Allah with
sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will
remit your sins, and admit you into gardens
beneath which rivers flow, on the Day when
Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and
those who believed with him. Their light
streaming before them, and to their right,
they will say, “Our Lord, complete our light
for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all
things.”
9. O prophet! Strive hard against the disbe-
lievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with
them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable
destination!
10. Allah illustrates an example of those who
disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of
Lot. They were under two of Our righteous
servants, but they betrayed them. They
availed them nothing against Allah, and it
was said, “Enter the Fire with those who are
entering.”
11. And Allah illustrates an example of those
who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she
said, “My Lord, build for me, with you, a
house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh
and his works, and save me from the wrong-
doing people.”
12. And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who
guarded her womb, and so We breathed into
her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the
truth of her Lord’s Words and His Books, and
was one of the devout.
67. SOVEREIGNTY
(al-Mulk)

Blessed is He in whose hand is the sover-
eignty, and Who has power over everything.
2. He who created death and life—to test
you—as to which of you is better in conduct.
He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.
3. He who created seven heavens in layers.
You see no discrepancy in the creation of the
Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any
cracks?
4. Then look again, and again, and your sight
will return to you dazzled and exhausted.
5. We have adorned the lower heaven with
lanterns, and made them missiles against the
devils; and We have prepared for them the
punishment of the Blaze.
6. For those who reject their Lord, there is the
torment of Hell. What an evil destination!
7. When they are thrown into it, they will hear
it roaring, as it seethes.
8. It almost bursts with fury. Every time a
batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask
them, “Has no warner come to you?”
1.
21868. THE PEN (al-Qalam)
9. They will say, “Yes, a warner
did come to us,
but we disbelieved, and said, ‘Allah did not
send down anything; you are very much mis-
taken.’”
10. And they will say, “Had we listened or rea-
soned, we would not have been among the in-
mates of the Blaze.”
11. So they will acknowledge their sins. So
away with the inmates of the Blaze.
12. As for those who fear their Lord in secret—
for them is forgiveness and a great reward.
13. Whether you keep your words secret, or
declare them—He is Aware of the inner
thoughts.
14. Would He not know, He Who created? He
is the Refined, the Expert.
15. It is He who made the earth manageable for
you, so travel its regions, and eat of His pro-
visions. To Him is the Resurgence.
16. Are you confident that the One in heaven
will not cause the earth to collapse beneath
you as it spins?
17. Or are you confident that the One in
Heaven will not unleash against you a violent
storm? Then you will know what My warning
is like.
18. Those before them also denied the truth;
and how was My disapproval?
19. Have they not seen the birds above them,
spreading their wings, and folding them?
None holds them except the Compassionate.
He is Perceiver of everything.
20. Or who is this who is a force for you to pro-
tect you against the Compassionate? The dis-
believers are in nothing but delusion.
21. Or who is this that will provide for you, if
He withholds His provision? Yet they persist
in defiance and aversion.
22. Is he who walks bent on his own design
better guided, or he who walks upright on a
straight path?
23. Say, “It is He who produced you; and made
for you the hearing, and the vision, and the
organs. But rarely do you give thanks.”
Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth,
and to Him you will be rounded up.”
25. And they say, “When will this promise be
fulfilled, if you are truthful?”
26. Say, “Knowledge is with Allah, and I am
only a clear warner.”
27. But when they see it approaching, the faces
of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy,
and it will be said, “This is what you used to
call for.”
28. Say, “Have you considered? Should Allah
make me perish, and those with me; or else
He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect
the disbelievers from an agonizing torment?”
29. Say, “He is the Compassionate. We have
faith in Him, and in Him we trust. Soon you
will know who is in evident error.”
30. Say, “Have you considered? If your water
drains away, who will bring you pure running
water?”
24.
68. THE PEN
(al-Qalam)

1. Noon. By the pen, and by what they in-
scribe.
2. By the grace of your Lord, you are not in-
sane.
3. In fact, you will have a reward that will
never end.
4. And you are of a great moral character.
5. You will see, and they will see.
6. Which
of you is the afflicted.
7. Your Lord knows best who has strayed from
His path, and He knows best the well-guided.
8. So
do not obey the deniers.
9. They would like you to compromise, so they
would compromise.
10. And
do not obey any vile swearer.

The most reasonable of them said, “Did I
not say to you, ‘if only you would glorify?’”
29. They said, “Glory to our Lord—We were
indeed in the wrong.”
30. Then they turned to one another, blaming
one another.
31. They said, “Woe to us—we were indeed
domineering.
32. Perhaps our Lord will give us a better sub-
stitute for it. We are turning to our Lord.”
33. Such is the punishment; but the punish-
ment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only
knew.

judge?
37. Or do you have a scripture in which you
study.
38. Wherein
there is whatever you choose?
do you have oaths from Us, binding un-
til the Day of Resurrection, that you will have
whatever you demand?
40. Ask them, which of them will guarantee
that.
41. Or do they have partners? Then let them
produce their partners, if they are truthful.

and they will be called to bow down, but they

they were sound.
44. So leave Me to those who reject this dis-
course; We will proceed against them gradu-
ally, from where they do not know.
45. And I will give them respite. My plan is
firm.
46. Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are
burdened with debt?
47. Or do they know the future, and so they
write it down?
48. So wait patiently for the Decision of your
Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish
who cried out in despair.
49. Were it not for his Lord’s favor that
reached him, he would have been thrown
into the wilderness, fully despised.

of the righteous.
