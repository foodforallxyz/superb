76. MAN
(al-Insan)

1. Has
there come upon man a period of time
when he was nothing to be mentioned?
2. We created man from a liquid mixture, to
test him; and We made him hearing and see-
ing.
3. We guided him to the way, be he apprecia-
tive or unappreciative.
4. We have prepared for the faithless chains,
and yokes, and a Searing Fire.
5. But the righteous will drink from a cup
whose mixture is aroma.
6. A spring from which the servants of Allah
will drink, making it gush abundantly.
7. They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day
whose ill is widespread.
8. And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor,
and the orphan, and the captive.
9. “We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We
want from you neither compensation, nor
gratitude.
10. We dread from our Lord a frowning grim
Day.”
11. So Allah will protect them from the ills of
that Day, and will grant them radiance and
joy.
12. And will reward them for their patience
with a Garden and silk.
13. Reclining therein on the thrones; experi-
encing therein neither sun, nor frost.

16. Crystal of silver—they measured them ex-
actly.
17. They will be served therein with a cup
whose flavor is Zanjabeel.
18. A
spring therein named Salsabeel.
Passing among them are eternalized
youths. If you see them, you would think
them sprinkled pearls.

22777. THE UNLEASHED (al-Mursalat)
Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a
vast kingdom.
21. Upon them are garments of green silk, and
satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets
of silver. And their Lord will offer them a
pure drink.
22. “This is a reward for you. Your efforts are
well appreciated.”
23. It is We who sent down the Quran upon
you—a gradual revelation.
24. So be patient for the decision of your Lord,
and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer
among them.
25. And mention the Name of your Lord,
morning and evening.
26. And for part of the night, prostrate yourself
to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.
27. As for these: they love the fleeting life, and
leave behind a Heavy Day.
28. We created them, and strengthened their
frame; and whenever We will, We can replace
them with others like them.
29. This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let
him take a path to his Lord.
30. Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Al-
lah is Knowing and Wise.
31. He admits into His mercy whomever He
wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has pre-
pared for them a painful punishment.
