86. THE NIGHTLY VISITOR (at-Tariq)

1. By the sky and at-Tariq (Piercing Star).
4. There is no soul without a Protector over it.
5. Let man consider what he was created from.
6. He was created from gushing liquid. Coming
from between the backbone and the
breastbones.
8. He is certainly able to return him.
9. On the Day when the secrets are disclosed.
10. He will have no strength, and no supporter.
11. By the sky that returns.
12. And
the earth that cracks open.
13. It is a Decisive Word.
14. It is no joke.
15. They
plot and scheme.
16. But
I plot and scheme.
Therefore, give the blasphemers respite, a
brief respite.



87. THE MOST HIGH (al-Aâ€™la)

2. Allah creates and regulates.

3. He who measures and guides.
4. He who produces the pasture.
5. And then turns it into light debris.
6. We will make you read, so do not forget.
7. Except what Allah wills. He knows what is declared, and what is hidden.
8. We will ease you into the Easy Way.
9. So remind, if reminding helps.
10. The reverent will remember.
11. But the wretched will avoid it.
12. He who will enter the Gigantic Fire.
13. Where
he will neither die, nor live.
14. Successful is he who purifies himself. And mentions the name of his Lord, and
prays. 15.
16. But you prefer the present life.
Though the Hereafter is better, and more
lasting.
18. This is in the former scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
