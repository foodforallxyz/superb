##  98. CLEAR EVIDENCE (al-Bayyinah)

Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists were not to be parted [from misbelief] 1828 until
there came to them clear evidence –

2. A Messenger from AllŒh, reciting purified 1829 scriptures

3. Within which are correct writings [i.e., rulings and laws].

4. Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided 1830
until after there had come to them clear evidence.

5. And they were not commanded except to worship AllŒh, [being]
sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish
prayer and to give zakŒh. And that is the correct religion.

6. Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture
and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally
therein. Those are the worst of creatures.

7. Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds –
those are the best of creatures.

8. Their reward with AllŒh will be gardens of perpetual residence
beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever,
AllŒh being pleased with them and they with Him. That is for
whoever has feared his Lord.
