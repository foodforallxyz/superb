{{< s v="1" >}}  By the star as it goes down. friend has not gone astray, nor has he erred.

{{< s v="2" >}}  The Prophet Mohammad:
- has not strayed nor erred. 
- {{< s v="3" >}} nor does he speak out of his own inclination.

{{< s v="4" >}} He speaks from a revelation revealed, {{< s v="5" >}} taught to him by the extremely powerful Gabriel. 

He rose to his true form while he was in the higher part of the horizon.
- Then he approached and descended and was at a distance of two bow-lengths or nearer.

- He revealed to His Servant

11. The heart did not lie [about] what it saw.
12. So will you dispute with him over what he saw?
13. And he certainly saw him in another descent 1459
14. At the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary –
15. Near it is the Garden of Refuge [i.e., Paradise] –
16. When there covered the Lote Tree that which covered [it]. 14





Will you dispute with him concerning
what he saw?

13. He saw him on another descent.
14. At the Lotus Tree of the Extremity.
15. Near
which is the Garden of Repose.
there covered the Lotus Tree what cov-
ered it.

you considered al-Lat and al-Uzza?
20. And
Manat, the third one, the other?
21. Are you to have the males, and He the fe-
males?
22. What
a bizarre distribution.
These are nothing but names, which you
have devised, you and your ancestors, for
which Allah sent down no authority. They
follow nothing but assumptions, and what
the ego desires, even though guidance has
come to them from their Lord.
24. Or is the human being to have whatever he
desires?
23.
25. To
Allah belong the Last and the First.
many an angel is there in the heavens
whose intercession avails nothing, except af-
ter Allah gives permission to whomever He
wills, and approves?
27. Those who do not believe in the Hereafter
give the angels the names of females.
28. They have no knowledge of that. They only
follow assumptions, and assumptions are no
substitute for the truth.
29. So avoid him who has turned away from
Our remembrance, and desires nothing but
the present life.
30. That is the extent of their knowledge. Your
Lord knows best who has strayed from His
path, and He knows best who has accepted
guidance.
31. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heav-
ens and whatever is on earth. He will repay
those who do evil according to their deeds,
and recompense those who do good with the
best.
32. Those who avoid gross sins and indecen-
cies—except for minor lapses—your Lord is
of Vast Forgiveness. He knows you well, ever
since He created you from the earth, and ever
since you were embryos in your mothers’
wombs. So do not acclaim your own virtue;
He is fully aware of the righteous.
26. How
Have you considered him who turned
away?
33.
34. And
gave a little, and held back?
he possess knowledge of the unseen,
and can therefore foresee?
36. Or was he not informed of what is in the
Scrolls of Moses?

38. That
of Abraham, who fulfilled?
no soul bears the burdens of another
soul.
39. And that the human being attains only
what he strives for.
40. And
that his efforts will be witnessed.
Then he will be rewarded for it the fullest
reward.
41.
42. And
that to your Lord is the finality.
that it is He who causes laughter and
weeping.
43. And
44. And
that it is He who gives death and life.
And that it is He who created the two
kinds—the male and the female.
45.
46. From
a sperm drop, when emitted.
47. And
that upon Him is the next existence.
48. And that it is He who enriches and impov-
erishes.
49. And
that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius.
And that it is He who destroyed the first
Aad.

51. And
Thamood, sparing no one.
And the people of Noah before that; for
they were most unjust and most oppressive.

53. And
He toppled the ruined cities.
And covered them with whatever covered
them.
55. So which of your Lord's marvels can you
deny?
56. This is a warning, just like the first warn-
ings.

you marvel at this discourse?
60. And laugh, and do not weep?
61. Lost in your frivolity?
62. So
And We left it as a sign. Is there anyone
who would take heed?
{{< s v="16" >}}So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
17. We made the Quran easy to learn. Is there
anyone who would learn?
18. Aad denied the truth. So how were My
punishment and My warnings?
19. We unleashed upon them a screaming
wind, on a day of unrelenting misery.
20. Plucking the people away, as though they
were trunks of uprooted palm-trees.
21. So how were My punishment and My
warnings?
22. We made the Quran easy to remember. Is
there anyone who would remember?
15.
bow down to Allah, and worship!
