{{< s v="14" >}} We received the pledge of the Christians. 
- But they neglected some of what they were reminded of.
- So We provoked enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection; 

Allah will then inform them of what they used to craft.

{{< s v="15" >}} O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, clarifying much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and overlooking much. 

A light from Allah has come to you, and a clear Book.

{{< s v="16" >}} Allah guides with it whoever follows His approval to the ways of peace.
- He brings them out of darkness into light, by His permission
- He guides them in a straight path.

{{< s v="17" >}} They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the Christ, the son of Mary.” 

Say, “Who can prevent Allah from annihilating the Christ son of Mary, and his mother, and everyone on earth?” 

<!-- To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and Allah has power over everything. -->

{{< s v="18" >}} The Jews and the Christians say, “We are the children of Allah, and His beloved.” 

Say: “Why then does He punish you for your sins?” 

In fact, you are humans from among those He created. 

<!-- He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. To Allah
belongs the dominion of the heavens and the
earth and what lies between them, and to
Him is the return. -->


{{< s v="19" >}} O People of the Book! Our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you—after a cessation of messengers—so that you
cannot say, “No preacher has come to us, and no warner.” 

In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner; <!-- and Allah is Capable of
everything. -->

{{< s v="20" >}} When Moses said to his people, “O my people, remember Allah’s blessings upon
you, when He placed prophets among you, and made you kings, and gave you what He never gave any other people.”

{{< s v="21" >}} “O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned for you, and do not turn back, lest you return as losers.”

{{< s v="22" >}} They said, “O Moses, there are tyrannical people in it; we will not enter it until they leave it. If they leave it, we will be entering.”

{{< s v="23" >}}  Two men of those who feared, but whom Allah had blessed, said, “Go at them by the gate; and when you have entered it, you will prevail. And put your trust in Allah, if you are believers.”

{{< s v="24" >}}  They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. 

So go ahead, you and your Lord, and fight. We are staying right here.”

{{< s v="25" >}}  He said, “My Lord! I have control only over myself and my brother, so separate between us and between the wicked people.”

{{< s v="26" >}}  He said, “It is forbidden for them for 40 years. They will wander aimlessly in the land. So do not grieve over the defiant people.”

{{< s v="27" >}}  Relate to them the true story of Adam's two sons: when they offered an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, but it was not accepted from the other. He Said, “I will kill you.” He Said, “Allah accepts only from the righteous.”

{{< s v="28" >}} “If you extend your hand to kill me, I will not extend my hand to kill you; for I fear Allah, Lord of the Worlds.”

{{< s v="29" >}} “I would rather you bear my sin and your sin, and you become among the inmates of the Fire. Such is the reward for the evildoers.”

{{< s v="30" >}} Then His soul prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him, and became one of the losers.

Then Allah sent a raven digging the ground, to show him how to cover his brother's corpse. He said, “Woe to me! I was unable
to be like this raven, and bury my brother's corpse.” 

So he became full of regrets.

{{< s v="32" >}} Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel: that whoever kills a person unless it is for murder or corruption on earth—it is as if he killed the whole of mankind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved the whole of mankind. 

Our messengers came to them with clarifications, but even after that, many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.

{{< s v="33" >}}  The punishment for those who fight Allah and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they be killed, or crucified, or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, or be banished from the land.

That is to disgrace them in this life; and in the Hereafter they will have a terrible punishment.

{{< s v="34" >}} Except for those who repent before you apprehend them. So know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

{{< s v="35" >}} Be conscious of Allah, and seek the means of approach to Him, and strive in His cause, so that you may succeed.

{{< s v="36" >}} As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them.

For them is a painful punishment.

{{< s v="37" >}} They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a lasting punishment.

{{< s v="38" >}} As for the thief, whether male or female, cut their hands as a penalty for what they have reaped—a deterrent from Allah. 

{{< s v="39" >}} But whoever repents after his crime, and reforms, Allah will accept his repentance. 

<!-- {{< s v="40" >}} Do you not know that to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He  -->

{{< s v="41" >}} O Messenger! Do not let those who are quick to disbelief grieve you, 
- They say they believe but their hearts do not believe

The Jews are listeners to lies<!-- , listeners to other people who did not come to you.  -->
- They distort words from their places.
- They say: “If you are given this, accept it. But if you are not given it, beware.” 

<!-- Whomever Allah has willed to divert, you have nothing for him from Allah.  -->

Allah does not intend to purify their hearts.
- They are a disgrace in this world.
- There is a great punishment for them in the Hereafter.


{{< s v="42" >}} Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit earnings. 
- If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. 

If you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between
them equitably. Allah loves the equitable. 

{{< s v="43" >}} But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is Allah’s Law? 

Yet they turn away after that. These are not believers.


{{< s v="44" >}} We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light. The submissive prophets
ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rabbis and the scholars, as they were required to protect Allah’s Book, and were witnesses to it.

So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My revelations for a cheap price.
Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the unbelievers.

{{< s v="45" >}} We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for
an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him.

Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealed are the evildoers.

{{< s v="46" >}} In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, fulfilling the Torah.
- We gave him the Gospel, with its guidance and light, confirming the Torah that preceded him. 


{{< s v="47" >}} So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what Allah revealed in it. Those who do not rule according to what Allah revealedare the sinners.

{{< s v="48" >}}  We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded it, and superseding it. 

So judge between them according to what Allah revealed. 
- Do not follow their desires if they differ from that truth. 

For each of you We have assigned a law and a method. 
- Had Allah willed, He could have made you a single nation.
- But He tests you through what He has given you. 
- So compete in righteousness. 

To Allah is your return, all of you. 
- Then He will inform you of what you had disputed.


{{< s v="49" >}} Judge between them according to what Allah revealed, and do not follow their desires. 

Beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. 

But if they turn away, know that Allah intends to strike them with some of their sins. In fact, a great many people are
corrupt. 

{{< s v="50" >}} Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? 

Who is better than Allah in judgment for people who are certain?


{{< s v="51" >}} Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies.
- Some of them are allies of one another. 
- Whoever of you allies himself with them is one of them. 
- Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.


{{< s v="52" >}} You will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them. 

They say, “We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us.” 

But perhaps Allah will bring about victory, or some event of His making; thereupon they will regret what they concealed within themselves.

{{< s v="53" >}} Those who believe will say, “Are these the ones who swore by Allah with their strongest
oaths that they are with you?” 

Their works have failed, so they became losers. 

<!-- punishes whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Capable of everything. -->

O you who believe! Whoever of you goesback on his religion—Allah will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with the disbelievers. 

They strive in the way of Allah, and do not fear the blame of the critic. 
<!-- That is the grace of Allah; He bestows it upon whomever He wills.  -->


{{< s v="55" >}} Your allies are:
- Allah
- His Messenger
- those who believe
  - those who pray regularly, give charity, and bow down. 

{{< s v="56" >}} Whoever allies himself with them will be victorious because the Party of Allah is the victorious.

{{< s v="57" >}} Do not befriend those who mock your religion as a sport, whether they from:
- among those who were given the Scripture before you, or
- the disbelievers. 

58. When you call to the prayer, they take it as a joke and a trifle. That is because they are people who do not reason.
59. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah, and
in what was revealed to us, and in what was revealed previously; and most of you are sinners?”

60. Say, “Shall I inform you of worse than that for retribution from Allah? He whom Allah
has cursed, and with whom He became angry; and He turned some of them into apes,
and swine, and idol worshipers. 

These are in a worse position, and further away from the right way.”

61. When they come to you, they say, “We believe,” though they have entered with disbelief, and they have departed with it. But Allah is well aware of what they hide.

62. You see many of them competing with one another in sin and hostility, and their con-
suming of what is illicit. What they have been doing is truly evil.
63. Why do the rabbis and the priests not prevent them from speaking sinfully and from
consuming forbidden wealth? Evil is what they have been doing.
The Jews say, “Allah’s hand is tied.” 

It is their hands that are tied, and they are cursed for what they say. In fact, His hands are out-
stretched; He gives as He wills. 

Certainly, what was revealed to your from your Lord will increase many of them in defiance and
blasphemy. And We placed between them enmity and hatred, until the Day of Resurrec-
tion. 

Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to
spread corruption on earth. <!-- Allah does not love the corrupters. -->

65. Had the People of the Scriputure believed and been righteous, We would have remitted their sins, and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.

66. Had they observed the Torah, and the Gospel, and what was revealed to them from their
Lord, they would have consumed amply from above them, and from beneath their feet.
Among them is a moderate community, but evil is what many of them are doing.

67. O Messenger, convey what was revealed to you from your Lord. But if you do not, then
you would not have delivered His message. 

And Allah will protect you from the people. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
68. Say, “O People of the Scripture! You have no basis until you uphold the Torah, and the
Gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord.” But what is revealed to you from
your Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelief, so do not be sorry for
the disbelieving people.

69. Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabians, and the Christians—whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and does what is right—they have nothing to fear, nor
shall they grieve.

70. We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent to them messengers. 

Whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire, some of them they accused of lying, and others they put to death.

71. They assumed there would be no punishment, so they turned blind and deaf. Then Allah redeemed them, but then again many of them turned blind and deaf. But Allah is Seeing of what they do.

72. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the Messiah the son of Mary.” 

But the Messiah himself said, “O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever associates others with Allah, Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his dwelling is the Fire. 

The wrongdoers have no saviors.”

73. They disbelieve those who say, “Allah is the third of three.” But there is no deity except
the One God. If they do not refrain from what they say, a painful torment will befall those among them who disbelieve.

74. Will they not repent to Allah and ask His
forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
75. The Messiah son of Mary was only a mes-
senger, before whom other Messengers had
passed away, and his mother was a woman of
truth. They both used to eat food. Note how
We make clear the revelations to them; then
note how deluded they are.

76. Say, “Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to harm or benefit you?” But
Allah: He is the Hearer, the Knower.

77. Say, “O People of the Scripture! Do not exaggerate in your religion beyond the truth;
and do not follow the opinions of people who went astray before, and misled many, and
themselves strayed off the balanced way.”

78. Cursed were those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel by the tongue of
David and Jesus son of Mary. That is because they rebelled and used to transgress.
79. They used not to prevent one another from the wrongs they used to commit. Evil is what
they used to do.

80. You will see many of them befriending those who disbelieve. Terrible is what their souls prompts them to do. The wrath of Allah fell upon them, and in the torment they will remain.

Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, they would not have befriended them. But many of them are immoral.

82. You will find that the people most hostile towards the believers are the Jews and the
polytheists. And you will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those
who say, “We are Christians.” That is because among them are priests and monks, and they
are not arrogant.

83. And when they hear what was revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing
with tears, as they recognize the truth in it.

They say, “Our Lord, we have believed, so count us among the witnesses.”
84. “And why should we not believe in Allah, and in the truth that has come to us, and hope
that our Lord will include us among the righteous people?”

85. Allah will reward them for what they say—Gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. Such is the reward of the righteous.

86. But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs—these are the inmates of the Fire.

87. O you who believe! Do not prohibit the good things Allah has permitted for you, and do not commit aggression. Allah does not love the aggressors.
88. And eat of the lawful and good things Allah has provided for you; and be conscious of Allah, in whom you are believers.

89. Allah does not hold you accountable for your unintended oaths, but He holds you accountable for your binding oaths. The atonement for it is by feeding ten needy people
from the average of what you feed your families, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave. Anyone who lacks the means shall fast for three days. That is the atonement for
breaking your oaths when you have sworn them. 

So keep your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear His Revelations to you, that you may be grateful.

90. O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and divination are abominations of Satan’s doing. Avoid them, so that you may prosper.

91. Satan wants to provoke strife and hatred among you through intoxicants and gambling, and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer. Will you not desist?

92. Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, and be cautious. If you turn away—know that the duty of Our Messenger is clear communication.
93. Those who believe and do righteous deeds will not be blamed for what they may have
eaten, provided they obey, and believe, and do good deeds, then maintain piety and faith,
then remain righteous and charitable. Allah loves the charitable.

94. O you who believe! Allah will test you with something of the game your hands and spears
obtain, that Allah may know who fears Him at heart. Whoever commits aggression after
that will have a painful punishment.

95. O you who believe! do not kill game while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Whoever of you
kills any intentionally, its penalty shall be a domestic animal comparable to what he
killed, as determined by two honest persons among you—an offering delivered to the Kaabah. Or he may atone by feeding the needy, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the consequences of his conduct.

Allah forgives what is past. But whoever repeats, Allah will take revenge on him. Allah is Almighty, Avenger.

96. Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and its food—as sustenance for you and for trav-
elers. But forbidden for you is the game of land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And
fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered. 

97. Allah has appointed the Kaabah, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for the people, and the Sa-
cred Month, and the offerings, and the garlanded. 

That you may know that Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and
that Allah is Cognizant of all things.
Know that Allah is severe in retribution,
and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
99. The Messenger’s sole duty is to convey. Al-
lah knows what you reveal and what you con-
ceal.
100. Say: “The bad and the good are not equal,
even though the abundance of the bad may
impress you. So be conscious of Allah, O you
who possess intelligence, that you may suc-
ceed.”
101. O you who believe! Do not ask about
things that would trouble you if disclosed to
you. But if you were to ask about them while
the Quran is being revealed, they will become
obvious to you. Allah forgives that. Allah is
Forgiving and Clement.
102. A people before you asked about them, but
then came to reject them.
103. Allah did not institute the superstitions of
Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami; but
those who disbelieve fabricate lies about Al-
lah—most of them do not understand.
104. And when it is said to them, “Come to
what Allah has revealed, and to the Messen-
ger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is what we
found our forefathers upon.” Even if their
forefathers knew nothing, and were not
guided?
105. O you who believe! You are responsible
for your own souls. He who has strayed can-
not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is
you return, all of you, and He will inform you
of what you used to do.
106. O you who believe! When death ap-
proaches one of you, let two reliable persons
from among you act as witnesses to the mak-
ing of a bequest, or two persons from another
people if you are travelling in the land and the
event of death approaches you. Engage them
after the prayer. If you have doubts, let them
swear by Allah: “We will not sell our testi-
mony for any price, even if he was a near rel-
ative, and we will not conceal Allah’s testi-
mony, for then we would be sinners.”
107. If it is discovered that they are guilty of
perjury: let two others take their place, two
98.

of us, and a sign from You; and provide for
us; You are the Best of providers.”
115. Allah said, “I will send it down to you. But
whoever among you disbelieves thereafter, I
will punish him with a punishment the like of
which I never punish any other being.”
116. And Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary,
did you say to the people, `Take me and my
mother as gods rather than Allah?'“ He will
say, “Glory be to You! It is not for me to say
what I have no right to. Had I said it, You
would have known it. You know what is in
my soul, and I do not know what is in your
soul. You are the Knower of the hidden.
117. I only told them what You commanded
me: that you shall worship Allah, my Lord
and your Lord. And I was a witness over them
while I was among them; but when You took
me to Yourself, you became the Watcher over
them—You are Witness over everything.
118. If You punish them, they are Your serv-
ants; but if You forgive them, You are the
Mighty and Wise.”
119. Allah will say, “This is a Day when the
truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.”
They will have Gardens beneath which rivers
flow, wherein they will remain forever. Allah
is pleased with them, and they are pleased
with Him. That is the great attainment.
120. To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the
heavens and the earth and what lies in them,
and He has power over everything.
from among those responsible for the claim,
and have them swear by Allah, “Our testi-
mony is more truthful than their testimony,
and we will not be biased, for then we would
be wrongdoers.”


108. That makes it more likely that they will give true testimony, fearing that their oaths
might be contradicted by subsequent oaths. 

<!-- So fear Allah, and listen. --> Allah does not guide the disobedient people.

109. On the Day when Allah will gather the messengers, then say, “What response were
you given?” They will say, “We have no
knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of
the unseen.”
110. When Allah will say, “O Jesus son of Mary,
recall My favor upon you and upon your
mother, how I supported you with the Holy
Spirit. You spoke to the people from the crib,
and in maturity. How I taught you the Scrip-
ture and wisdom, and the Torah and the Gos-
pel. And recall that you molded from clay the
shape of a bird, by My leave, and then you
breathed into it, and it became a bird, by My
leave. And you healed the blind and the lep-
rous, by My leave; and you revived the dead,
by My leave. And recall that I restrained the
Children of Israel from you when you
brought them the clear miracles. But those
who disbelieved among them said, `This is
nothing but obvious sorcery.'“
“And when I inspired the disciples: `Be-
lieve in Me and in My Messenger.' They said,
`We have believed, so bear witness that We
have submitted.'“
112. “And when the disciples said, 'O Jesus son
of Mary, is your Lord able to bring down for
us a feast from heaven?' He said, 'Fear Allah,
if you are believers.'“
113. They said, “We wish to eat from it, so that
our hearts may be reassured, and know that
you have told us the truth, and be among
those who witness it.”
114. Jesus son of Mary said, “O Allah, our Lord,
send down for us a table from heaven, to be a
festival for us, for the first of us, and the last
111.
