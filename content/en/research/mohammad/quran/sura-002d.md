228. Divorced women shall wait by themselves for 3 periods. 

It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the
Last Day. Meanwhile, their husbands have the better right to take them back, if they de-
sire reconciliation. And women have rights
similar to their obligations, according to what
is fair. But men have a degree over them. 

229. Divorce is allowed twice. 

Then, either honorable retention, or setting free kindly. It
is not lawful for you to take back anything
you have given them, unless they fear that
they cannot maintain Allah's limits. If you
fear that they cannot maintain Allah’s limits,
then there is no blame on them if she sacri-
fices something for her release. These are Al-
lah’s limits, so do not transgress them. Those
who transgress Allah’s limits are the unjust.
230. If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful
for him again until she has married another
husband. If the latter divorces her, then there
is no blame on them for reuniting, provided
they think they can maintain Allah's limits.
These are Allah’s limits; He makes them clear
to people who know.

231. When you divorce women, and they have
reached their term, either retain them amica-
bly, or release them amicably. But do not re-
tain them to hurt them and commit aggres-
sion. Whoever does that has wronged him-
self. And do not take Allah’s revelations for a
joke. And remember Allah's favor to you, and
that He revealed to you the Scripture and
Wisdom to teach you. And fear Allah, and
know that Allah is aware of everything.

232. When you divorce women, and they have reached their term, do not prevent them from
marrying their husbands, provided they agree on fair terms. Thereby is advised who-
ever among you believes in Allah and the Last
Day. That is better and more decent for you.


233. Mothers may nurse their infants for two whole years, for those who desire to complete
the nursing-period. It is the duty of the father
to provide for them and clothe them in a
proper manner. No soul shall be burdenedbeyond its capacity. No mother shall be
harmed on account of her child, and no father shall be harmed on account of his child.
The same duty rests upon the heir. If the cou-
ple desire weaning, by mutual consent and
consultation, they commit no error by doing
so. You commit no error by hiring nursing-
mothers, as long as you pay them fairly. And
be wary of Allah, and know that Allah is See-
ing of what you do.

234. As for those among you who die and leave
widows behind, their widows shall wait by
themselves for four months and ten days.
When they have reached their term, there is
no blame on you regarding what they might
honorably do with themselves. Allah is fully
acquainted with what you do.
235. You commit no error by announcing your
engagement to women, or by keeping it to
yourselves. Allah knows that you will be
thinking about them. But do not meet them
secretly, unless you have something proper to
say. And do not confirm the marriage tie un-
til the writing is fulfilled. And know that Al-
lah knows what is in your souls, so beware of
Him. And know that Allah is Forgiving and
Forbearing.
236. You commit no error by divorcing women
before having touched them, or before hav-
ing set the dowry for them. And compensate
them—the wealthy according to his means,
and the poor according to his means—with a
fair compensation, a duty upon the doers of
good.


237. If you divorce them before you have
touched them, but after you had set the
dowry for them, give them half of what you
specified—unless they forego the right, or the
one in whose hand is the marriage contract
foregoes it. But to forego is nearer to piety.
And do not forget generosity between one
another. Allah is seeing of everything you do.
238. Guard your prayers, and the middle
prayer, and stand before Allah in devotion.
239. But if you are in fear, then on foot, or rid-
ing. And when you are safe, remember Allah,
as He taught you what you did not know.
240. Those of you who die and leave wives be-
hind—a will shall provide their wives with
support for a year, provided they do not
leave. If they leave, you are not to blame for
what they do with themselves, provided it is
reasonable. Allah is Mighty and Wise.
241. And divorced women shall be provided
for, equitably—a duty upon the righteous.
242. Allah thus explains His revelations to you,
so that you may understand.
243. Have you not considered those who fled
their homes, by the thousands, fearful of
death? Allah said to them, “Die.” Then He re-
vived them. Allah is Gracious towards the
people, but most people are not appreciative.
244. Fight in the cause of Allah, and know that
Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
245. Who is he who will offer Allah a generous
loan, so He will multiply it for him manifold?
Allah receives and amplifies, and to Him you
will be returned.

246. Have you not considered the notables of the Children of Israel after Moses? When
they said to a prophet of theirs, “Appoint a king for us, and we will fight in the cause of
Allah.” He said, “Is it possible that, if fighting
was ordained for you, you would not fight?”
They said, “Why would we not fight in the
cause of Allah, when we were driven out of
our homes, along with our children?” But
when fighting was ordained for them, they
turned away, except for a few of them. But Al-
lah is aware of the wrongdoers.

247. Their prophet said to them, “Allah has appointed Saul to be your king.” They said,
“How can he have authority over us, when we are more worthy of authority than he, and he
was not given plenty of wealth?” He said, “Allah has chosen him over you, and has in-
creased him in knowledge and stature.” Allah bestows His sovereignty upon whomever He
wills. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.

248. And their prophet said to them, “The proof of his kingship is that the Ark will be
restored to you, bringing tranquility from
your Lord, and relics left by the family of Mo-
ses and the family of Aaron. It will be carried
by the angels. In that is a sign for you, if you
are believers.”


249. When Saul set out with the troops, he said,
“Allah will be testing you with a river. Who-
ever drinks from it does not belong with me.
But whoever does not drink from it, does be-
long with me, except for whoever scoops up
a little with his hand.” But they drank from it,
except for a few of them. Then, when he
crossed it, he and those who believed with
him, they said, “We have no strength to face
Goliath and his troops today.” But those who
knew that they would meet Allah said, “How
many a small group has defeated a large
group by Allah’s will. Allah is with the stead-
fast.”

250. And when they confronted Goliath and
his troops, they said, “Our Lord, pour down
patience on us, and strengthen our foothold,
and support us against the faithless people.”

251. And they defeated them by Allah’s leave,
and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him
sovereignty and wisdom, and taught him as
He willed. Were it not for Allah restraining
the people, some by means of others, the
earth would have gone to ruin. But Allah is
gracious towards mankind.

252. These are Allah’s revelations, which We
recite to you in truth. You are one of the mes-
sengers.
253. These messengers: We gave some ad-
vantage over others. To some of them Allah
spoke directly, and some He raised in rank.


We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear miracles, and We strengthened him with the Holy
Spirit. Had Allah willed, those who succeeded them would not have fought one another, af-
ter the clear signs had come to them; but they disputed; some of them believed, and some of
them disbelieved. Had Allah willed, they
would not have fought one another; but Allah
does whatever He desires.

254. O you who believe! Spend from what We
have given you, before a Day comes in which
there is neither trading, nor friendship, nor
intercession. The disbelievers are the wrong-
doers.

255. Allah! There is no god except He, the Liv-
ing, the Everlasting. Neither slumber over-
takes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs every-
thing in the heavens and everything on earth.
Who is he that can intercede with Him except
with His permission? He knows what is be-
fore them, and what is behind them; and they
cannot grasp any of His knowledge, except as
He wills. His Throne extends over the heav-
ens and the earth, and their preservation does
not burden Him. He is the Most High, the
Great.

256. There shall be no compulsion in religion;
the right way has become distinct from the
wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and be-
lieves in Allah has grasped the most trustwor-
thy handle; which does not break. Allah is
Hearing and Knowing.

257. Allah is the Lord of those who believe; He
brings them out of darkness and into light. As
for those who disbelieve, their lords are the
evil ones; they bring them out of light and
into darkness—these are the inmates of the
Fire, in which they will abide forever.

258. Have you not considered him who argued
with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah
had given him sovereignty? Abraham said,
“My Lord is He who gives life and causes
death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.”
Abraham said, “Allah brings the sun from the
East, so bring it from the West,” so the blas-
phemer was confounded. Allah does not
guide the wrongdoing people.

Or like him who passed by a town col-
lapsed on its foundations. He said, “How can
Allah revive this after its demise?” Thereupon
Allah caused him to die for a hundred years,
and then resurrected him. He said, “For how
long have you tarried?” He said, “I have tar-
ried for a day, or part of a day.” He said, “No.
You have tarried for a hundred years. Now
look at your food and your drink—it has not
spoiled—and look at your donkey. We will
make you a wonder for mankind. And look
at the bones, how We arrange them, and then
clothe them with flesh.” So when it became
clear to him, he said, “I know that Allah has
power over all things.”

260. And when Abraham said, “My Lord, show
me how You give life to the dead.” He said,
“Have you not believed?” He said, “Yes, but
to put my heart at ease.” He said, “Take four
birds, and incline them to yourself, then place
a part on each hill, then call to them; and they
will come rushing to you. And know that Al-
lah is Powerful and Wise.”

261. The parable of those who spend their
wealth in Allah’s way is that of a grain that
produces seven spikes; in each spike is a hun-
dred grains. Allah multiplies for whom He
wills. Allah is Bounteous and Knowing.

262. Those who spend their wealth in the way
of Allah, and then do not follow up what they
spent with reminders of their generosity or
with insults, will have their reward with their
Lord—they have nothing to fear, nor shall
they grieve.

263. Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by insults. Allah is Rich
and Clement.

264. O you who believe! Do not nullify your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful
words, like him who spends his wealth to be seen by the people, and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is that of a smooth rock covered with soil: a downpour strikes it, and leaves it bare—they gain nothing from their efforts. Allah does not guide
the disbelieving people.

265. And the parable of those who spend their wealth seeking Allah’s approval, and to
strengthen their souls, is that of a garden on a hillside. If heavy rain falls on it, its produce
is doubled; and if no heavy rain falls, then dew is enough. Allah is seeing of everything
you do.

266. Would anyone of you like to have a garden of palms and vines, under which rivers
flow—with all kinds of fruit in it for him, and old age has stricken him, and he has weak
children—then a tornado with fire batters it, and it burns down? Thus Allah makes clear
the signs for you, so that you may reflect.

267. O you who believe! Give of the good things you have earned, and from what We
have produced for you from the earth. And do not pick the inferior things to give away,
when you yourselves would not accept it except with eyes closed. And know that Allah is
Sufficient and Praiseworthy.

268. Satan promises you poverty, and urges you to immorality; but Allah promises you
forgiveness from Himself, and grace. Allah is Embracing and Knowing.

269. He gives wisdom to whomever He wills. 

Whoever is given wisdom has been given
much good. But none pays heed except those
with insight.

270. Whatever charity you give, or a pledge you
fulfill, Allah knows it. The wrongdoers have
no helpers.

271. If you give charity openly, that is good. But if you keep it secret, and give it to the needy
in private, that is better for you. It will atone for some of your misdeeds. Allah is cognizant
of what you do.

272. Their guidance is not your responsibility, but Allah guides whom He wills. Any charity
you give is for your own good. Any charity you give shall be for the sake of Allah. Any
charity you give will be repaid to you in full, and you will not be wronged.

273. It is for the poor; those who are restrained
in the way of Allah, and unable to travel in
the land. The unaware would think them rich, due to their dignity. You will recognize
them by their features. They do not ask from people insistently. Whatever charity you give,
Allah is aware of it.

274. Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately and publicly, will receive
their reward from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve.

275. Those who swallow usury will not rise, except as someone driven mad by Satan's touch.

That is because they say, “Commerce is like usury.” But Allah has permitted commerce, and has forbidden usury. Whoever, on receiving advice from his Lord, refrains, may
keep his past earnings, and his case rests with Allah. But whoever resumes—these are the dwellers of the Fire, wherein they will abide
forever.

276. Allah condemns usury, and He blesses charities. Allah does not love any sinful in-
grate.

277. Those who believe, and do good deeds, and pray regularly, and give charity—they
will have their reward with their Lord; they will have no fear, nor shall they grieve.

278. O you who believe! Fear Allah, and forgo what remains of usury, if you are believers.

279. If you do not, then take notice of a war by Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent,
you may keep your capital, neither wronging, nor being wronged.

280. But if he is in hardship, then deferment until a time of ease. But to remit it as charity
is better for you, if you only knew.

281. And guard yourselves against a Day when
you will be returned to Allah; then each soul
will be rewarded fully for what it has earned,
and they will not be wronged.

282. O you who believe! When you incur debt among yourselves for a certain period of time, write it down. And have a scribe write in your presence, in all fairness. And let no scribe refuse to write, as Allah has taught him. So let him write, and let the debtor dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish nothing from it. But if the debtor is mentally deficient, or weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate with hon-
esty. And call to witness two men from among you. If two men are not available, then
one man and two women whose testimony is acceptable to all—if one of them fails to remember, the other would remind her. Witnesses must not refuse when called upon.
And do not think it too trivial to write down,
whether small or large, including the time of repayment. 

That is more equitable with Allah, and stronger as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubt—except in the case of a spot
transaction between you—then there is no blame on you if you do not write it down. 

Let there be witnesses whenever you conclude a contract, and let no harm be done to
either scribe or witness. If you do that, it is corruption on your part. 


283. If you are on a journey, and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit should be
handed over. But if you trust one another, let the trustee fulfill his trust, and let him fear Al-
lah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 

Whoever conceals it is sinner at heart. Allah is aware of what you do.

284. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is
within your selves, or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whom
He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. 


285. The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, as did the be-
lievers. They all have believed in Allah, and His angels, and His scriptures, and His mes-
sengers: “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We
hear and we obey. Your forgiveness, our Lord. To you is the destiny.”

286. Allah does not burden any soul beyond its capacity. To its credit is what it earns, and
against it is what it commits. “Our Lord, do not condemn us if we forget or make a mis-
take. Our Lord, do not burden us as You have burdened those before us. Our Lord, do not
burden us with more than we have strength to bear; and pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord and Master, so help us against the disbelieving people.”
