{{< s v="87">}} We :
- gave Moses the Scripture, and
- sent a succession of messengers after him
- gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs
- supported Jesus with the Holy Spirit. 

Whenever a messenger comes to you with anything that your souls do not want, you:
- grow arrogant
- call some impostors, and
- kill the others.

{{< s v="88">}} The Jews said that they hearts are sealed. Rather, Allah has cursed them for their ingratitude. They have little faith.

{{< s v="89">}} Previously, the Jews were seeking victory against those who disbelieved. 
- A scripture came to them from Allah, confirming what they have.
- But <!-- when there came to them what they recognized, --> they disbelieved in it. 
<!-- So Allah’s curse is upon the disbelievers. -->
- {{< s v="90">}} They rejected it because they resented the fact that Allah could send down His grace on whomever He chooses. 
<!-- 90. Miserable is what they sold their souls for—rejecting what Allah has revealed, out of  -->

<!-- Thus they incurred wrath upon wrath. And there is a demeaning punishment for the disbelievers. -->
<!-- And when it is said to them, “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” --> 

The Jews believe in what was revealed to them. But they reject anything beyond that. <!-- , although it is the truth which confirms what they have.  -->

Ask them: “Why did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you were believers?”

{{< s v="92" >}} Moses came to you with clear proofs, yet you adopted the calf in his absence, and you were wrong.

We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount above you: “Take what We have given you firmly, and listen.” 

They said, “We hear and disobey.” 

But they loved the calf [Hinduism?] because of their disbelief. 

<!-- Say: “Wretched is what your faith commands you to do, if you are believers.” -->

94. Say, “If the Final Home with Allah is yours alone, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death if you are sincere.”

95. But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have forwarded. 

96. You will find them, of all mankind, the most eager for life, even more than the polytheists [Hindus?]. 

Every one of them wishes he could live a thousand years; but to be granted a long life will not nudge him from the punishment.

97. Say, “Whoever is hostile to Gabriel—it is he who revealed it to your heart by Allah’s leave, confirming what preceded it, and guidance and good news for the believers.”

98. Allah is hostile to:
- the faithless
- those who are hostile to Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael 

<!-- 99. We have revealed to you clear signs, and none rejects them except the sinners. -->

100. Whenever the Jews make a covenant, some of them toss it aside. In fact, most of them do not believe.

101. <!-- And when there came to them a messenger from Allah, confirming what they had, --> A faction of those who were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they do not know.

102. They followed what the devils taught during the reign of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils. 

They taught the people witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon to the 2 angels Harut and Marut. 

They did not teach anybody until they had said, “We are a test, so do not lose faith.” 

But they learned from them the means to cause separation between man and his wife. But they cannot harm anyone except with Allah's permission. And they learned what would harm them and not benefit them. 

Yet they knew that whoever deals in it will have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable is what they sold their souls for, if they only knew. 

103. Had they believed and been righteous, the reward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew.

104. Muslims,  Do not say ambiguous words, but say words of respect, and listen.
The disbelievers will have a painful torment.

105. It is never the wish of the disbelievers from among the People of the Book, nor of the polytheists, that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But Allah chooses for His mercy whomever He wills. 

106. We never nullify a verse, nor cause it to be forgotten, unless We bring one better than it, or similar to it.

108. Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned before? Whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has strayed from the right path.

109. Many of the People of the Book wish to turn you back into unbelievers after you have believed, out of envy on their part, after the Truth has become clear to them. But pardon and overlook, until Allah brings His command.

<!-- 110. And perform the prayer, and give alms. 
Whatever good you forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. Allah is Seeing of everything you do. -->

111. They say, “None will enter Heaven unless he is a Jew or a Christian.” These are their wishes. Say, “Produce your proof, if you are truthful.”

112. Anyone who submits himself to Allah, and does good, will have his reward with his Lord. 

113. The Jews say, “The Christians are not based on anything”

the Christians say, “The Jews are not based on anything.” 

Yet they both read the Scripture. Similarly, the ignorant said the same thing. 

<!-- Allah will judge
between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences. -->

114. Who is more unjust than him who forbids the remembrance of Allah’s name in places of
worship, and contributes to their ruin? 

These ought not to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them
is a terrible punishment in the Hereafter.

115. To Allah belong the East and the West. Whichever way you turn, there is Allah’s presence. 

{{< s v="116" >}} They say, “Allah has begotten a son.” Be He glorified. Rather, His is everything in
the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him.

117. Originator of the heavens and the earth. Whenever He decrees a thing, He says to it, “Be,” and it becomes.

118. Those who do not know say, “If only Allah would speak to us, or a sign would come to
us.” Thus said those who were before them. Their hearts are alike. We have made the
signs clear for people who are certain.

119. We have sent you with the truth—bringing good news, and giving warnings. You will
not be questioned about the inmates of Hell.

120. The Jews and the Christians will not approve of you, unless you follow their creed.
Say, “Allah’s guidance is the guidance.”

Should you follow their desires, after the knowledge that has come to you, you will
have in Allah neither guardian nor helper.

121. Those to whom We have given the Scripture follow it, as it ought to be followed--these believe in it. But as for those who reject
it—these are the losers.

122. O Jews! Remember My blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I
have favored you over all people.

123. And beware of a Day when no soul will avail another soul in any way, and no ransom
will be accepted from it, and no intercession
will benefit it, and they will not be helped.

124. And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain words, and he fulfilled them. He said,
“I am making you a leader of humanity.” He said, “And my descendants?” He said, “My
pledge does not include the wrongdoers.”

125. And We made the House a focal point for the people, and a sanctuary. Use the shrine of
Abraham as a place of prayer. And We commissioned Abraham and Ishmael, “Sanctify
My House for those who circle around it, and those who seclude themselves in it, and those
who kneel and prostrate.”

126. When Abraham said, “O My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and provide its people
with fruits—whoever of them believes in Al-
lah and the Last Day.” He said, “And whoever
disbelieves, I will give him a little enjoyment,
then I will consign him to the punishment of
the Fire; how miserable the destiny!”
127. As Abraham raises the foundations of the
House, together with Ishmael, “Our Lord, ac-
cept it from us, You are the Hearer, the
Knower.
128. Our Lord, and make us submissive to You,
and from our descendants a community sub-
missive to You. And show us our rites, and accept our repentance. You are the Acceptor
of Repentance, the Merciful.

129. Our Lord, and raise up among them a
messenger, of themselves, who will recite to
them Your revelations, and teach them the
Book and wisdom, and purify them. You are
the Almighty, the Wise.”
130. Who would forsake the religion of Abra-
ham, except he who fools himself? We chose
him in this world, and in the Hereafter he will
be among the righteous.
131. When his Lord said to him, “Submit!” He
said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the
Worlds.”
132. And Abraham exhorted his sons, and Ja-
cob, “O my sons, Allah has chosen this reli-
gion for you, so do not die unless you have
submitted.”
133. Or were you witnesses when death ap-
proached Jacob, and he said to his sons,
“What will you worship after Me?” They said,
“We will worship your God, and the God of
your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac;
One God; and to Him we submit.”
134. That was a community that has passed; for
them is what they have earned, and for you is
what you have earned; and you will not be
questioned about what they used to do.
135. And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, and
you will be guided.” Say, “Rather, the religion
of Abraham, the Monotheist; he was not an
idolater.”

136. Say, “We believe in Allah; and in what was revealed to us; and in what was revealed to
Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to
Moses and Jesus; and in what was given to the prophets—from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we
surrender.”

137. If they believe in the same as you have believed in, then they have been guided. But if
they turn away, then they are in schism. Allah will protect you against them.

138. Allah’s coloring. And who gives better coloring than Allah? “And we are devoted to Him.”

139. Say, “Do you argue with us about Allah, when He is our Lord and your Lord, and We
have our works, and you have your works, and we are sincere to Him?”
140. Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs were Jews or
Christians? Say, “Do you know better, or Allah?” 

And who does greater wrong than he who conceals a testimony he has from Allah?
Allah is not unaware of what you do.

141. That was a community that has passed. To them is what they have earned, and to you is
what you have earned. And you will not be questioned about what they used to do.
