The unequal distribution of wealth is caused by private land ownership. As long private property exists, no increase in production will permanently benefit the masses. On the contrary, any improvements must depress their condition further. 

Poverty deepens as wealth increases. Wages fall while productivity grows. This is all because land, the source of all wealth and the field of all labor, is monopolized.

Unequal ownership of land causes unequal distribution of wealth. The unequal ownership of land is caused by individual property rights. Thus, **the only remedy is to make land common property.**

But this truth will arouse the most bitter antagonism. It must fight its way, inch by inch. Even those who admit this truth will say that it cannot be practically applied. 

In doing this we shall bring our previous reasoning to a new and crucial test. Just as we test addition by subtraction and multiplication by division, so we can we test our conclusions by the adequacy of our remedy. If it is practical, it proves our conclusions are correct.

<!-- The laws of the universe are harmonious. If the remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be consistent with justice; it must be practical in application; it must accord with the tendencies of social development; and it must harmonize with other reforms.

The laws of the universe do not deny the natural aspirations of the human heart. The progress of society can be toward equality, not inequality. Economic law will prove the perceptions of Marcus Aurelius=  "We are made for cooperation â€” like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth." -->
