Self-reliance is the main objective of our farming projects, hence they should be oriented towards production. 

They should not be dependent on outside resources. 

An integrated approach to farming should include:
- agriculture
- horticulture
- floriculture
- sericulture
- lac culture
- apiculture
- dairy farming
- animal husbandry
- irrigation
- pisciculture
- pest control
- fertilizers
- cottage industries
- energy production
- research centres
- water conservation. 

This approach will help make farming projects self-reliant.


## Agriculture

Agriculture is the science of cultivating the soil and rearing animals. It includes the production of staple crops. 

Staple crops which are important in Bengal include pulses of many kinds, cereals, coarse grains, oil-seeds, sugar crops and vegetables.

Pulses:
- provide protein
- supplement manure
  - They fix nitrogen in the soil from the air

**Calcium, phosphates, potash, etc must still be added to pulse crops.**

Cereals are rich in carbohydrates and include:
- rice
- wheat
- maize
- oats
- barley
- rye. 

Coarse grains include all types of:
- millet
- sorghum
- barley
- rye
- buckwheat. 

Oil-seeds include:
- mustard
- soya
- sesame
- linseed
- safflower
- sunflower. 

It is most important to exchange seeds between India and the rest of the world. 

Sugar crops include:
- sugar cane
- sugar beet
- date palm
- palmyra. 

Spices include cloves, cumin, coriander, etc. 

Many types of medicinal plants can be grown in Bengal.<!--  At Ánanda Nagar many herbaria should be established. -->

<!-- In India, many seasonal vegetables such as summer vegetables, winter vegetables and all-season vegetables are grown.  -->

The variety of vegetables that are produced should be increased. 

<!-- Onions and garlic are grown for sale to the public and for processing into medicines, but of course they are not beneficial for those doing spiritual practices. -->

<!-- Some other items include coffee, cocoa, tea and rubber.  -->

Tea and rubber can be grown:
- for use by the local people
- as cash crops. 

Cash crops <!--  help to transform the local economy. If cash crops are --> grown by cooperatives can help raise the economic standard of poor local people in a short time.

In the case of yellow mustard, big lentils and wheat, there is a choice of early, medium and late varieties.

But in the case of paddy there is no such choice. 

If the early, medium and late varieties of any crop are available for plantation, and sufficient time is at hand to choose any of them, then the early variety should be chosen first for plantation. <!-- Proper planning should be done so that the production of this crop is increased.  -->

In case the early variety fails, then the medium variety should be tried. 

If everything is done properly, the production of this variety will be almost equal to the early variety. If the medium variety also fails for some reason, then lastly the late variety should be tried. 

If the late variety is planted in the beginning of the season and fails for some reason, then there is no scope for cultivation and the season will be lost. 


Liquid manure should be applied along with the second irrigation after proper weeding.

Paddy is the staple food in northeastern India. 

In the boro variety of paddy, weeding should be done one month after transplantation, and then liquid manure should be applied. Care should be taken that the liquid manure is not poisonous, otherwise it will harm the pisciculture. Even rocky land can be made fit for cultivation after filling it up with good soil.

We should try our best to grow napier grass for cattle fodder on hillocks wherever possible. 

It is more difficult to grow napier grass on hills than on flat land because it takes a lot of water. Nevertheless we should try, in order to save the best crop land for other crops. 

Where there are railway lines which belong to the railway department going through agricultural land, cow pea, late áus paddy or black gram should be cultivated on both sides of the railway lines.

Whenever plants from frigid and temperate zones are transplanted into a warm or hot climate, they should be planted on high land, near stones and rocks if possible, so that at night they will be kept cool.

The fencing of all farm compounds except beauty spots may be utilized as a platform for spinach in spring and summer, and for beans in summer, the rainy season, autumn and winter. In the case of beauty spots, the fencing may be utilized as a platform for flower creepers.

Farming projects should grow crops for special emergency survival. These include:
- vegetables
- pulses
- potato
- fodder for dairy cows to ensure milk production. 

**All farming projects must start the production of these items immediately.** 

They are the minimum items necessary for physical survival. These items will ensure your survival in any difficult times that may come in the future.


## Horticulture

Fruit and vegetable gardens should be established on all farming projects. There are many varieties of fruit. Fruits can be utilized to make jams, marmalade, jellies, dried fruits, etc.


## Floriculture

Floriculture is the cultivation of flowers. Jasmine, magnolia, roses and so on can be used to make essences which in turn can be used to produce many other products. 

- Tube roses can be grown and sold throughout the world just as roses are today. 
- Roses grow very well in red soil. 
- Floral nectar can be collected from lotus and is very good for all kinds of eye diseases, including retinal detachment.

Honey can be prepared from the flowers of the lotus, lily, cornel and cotton tree. 

A huge amount of honey is available in the flowers of the lotus, lily and cotton tree. 

The lotus and lily also give floral nectar – nectar which is prepared by the flowers, not by the bees. This is a part of floriculture. 

Floral nectar should be produced from floriculture.

How can floral nectar be collected? It has to be collected with the help of a dropper or syringe. 

When I was young I used to eat the seeds of the lotus. In those days they were generally available throughout Burdwan. I also used to take floral nectar by licking the flower. 

From the honey and floral nectar of lotus and lily, many types of medicines can be made. If this honey and floral nectar is sold in the market, it will command a very high price. 

To extract floral nectar one has to employ the same method as doctors use to extract blood. This is because many ants and insects feed on floral nectar. A syringe can extract it without getting clogged up.

The stems of okra can be used for a special purpose. 

If you have a pineapple field which is not producing fruits nor flowers. If the okra stems are burnt and scattered throughout the field, the fumes and smoke will help the pineapple develop fruit and flowers. 

But one should be careful that the pineapple plant is not burnt. 

This process will produce both fruit and flowers very quickly.

The field of floriculture has been neglected very much. It should be developed. 

We can easily make rose scent and rose water from the rose garden at Ánanda Nagar.


## Useful Products From Insects

In Bengal, production based on insects has 3 main branches:

1. Sericulture

The first is sericulture. There are two main varieties of silk in Bengal – mulberry and non-mulberry. Mulberry silkworms feed on mulberry leaves, and can produce two qualities of silk – fine quality (garad) and rough quality (matka). 

Non-mulberry silk includes muuṋgá, tasar and endy. In the muuṋgá variety the silkworms feed on drumsticks. In the tasar variety the worms feed on many plants such as sal [Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.], arjuna [Terminalia arjuna Bedd.], Indian plum [Zizyphus jujube Linn.], asan [Terminalia tomentosa Bedd.], Assamese swalu [Kadsura hetroclita], a bush which is mostly confined to Assam, and Indian rosewood (svet sal) [Dalbergia latifolia Roxb.]. In the endy variety the silkworms feed on castor leaves.

The mulberry silkworm is a domesticated variety of silkworm. Tasar is a naturally grown variety of silkworm. In this variety the cocoons are put on trees in order for the larvae to feed. Once the larvae have hatched the cocoons are collected from the trees. In tasar production the trees are kept to the manageable height of six feet, otherwise it would be impractical to collect the cocoons.

In domesticated silk production, moths lay eggs. The larvae hatch from the eggs, eat leaves, grow to their full size and finally spin a cocoon made of silk. 

The cocoons are usually dried in the sun or boiled to kill the larvae. As the larvae are in a state of natural hibernation, when they are killed in this way they do not feel pain. 

The silk cocoons are collected and spun into silk thread. 

Silk production is a profitable industry.  Silk is an excellent clothing fibre. 

Some silk plants such as mulberry and Indian plum also produce fruit. Different crops can be grown around silk plants so that there is maximum utilization of agricultural land.

Non-grafted seedlings of mulberry give more foliage for silk production than grafted seedlings. 

Malda is a good source of mulberry. Mulberry seedlings should be planted in such a way that their shade does not fall on agricultural land.

The following should be grown between 2 mulberry plants:

1. Where the land is extremely rocky and there is no soil, soil should be brought from outside so that palm, Indian plum and custard-apple saplings, not seedlings, can be planted between 2 mulberry plants. 

Research should be done on the custard-apple and the Indian plum.

2. Where the land is extremely rocky but there are accumulations of soil between the rocks, thorny puneala plum (thorny paniala) [Flacourtia jangomas (Lour) Raeusch.] and custard-apple can be planted between two mulberry plants. 

Research should be done on the thorny puneala plum.

3. Where the land is less rocky, non-thorny puneala plum (non-thorny paniala) and custard-apple can be planted between two mulberry plants. Research should be done on the non-thorny puneala plum.

4. Where the land is a bit better than in number three above, date palm (khejur) and custard-apple saplings can be planted between two mulberry plants.

Custard-apple varieties from abroad should be brought to India as far as possible, especially the variety from the Philippines, which is a large variety. 

Sporting goods can be made from mulberry wood. Mulberry can be grown successfully in Ánanda Nagar.


2. Lac culture. 

Lacquer is produced by insects grown on trees such as palash [Butea frondosa Koenig-ex Roxb.], Indian plum and kusum [Schleichera trijuga Willd.]. Lac should not be grown on all Indian plum trees, otherwise fruit production will be affected. Lacquer may be used as protective varnish for furniture, etc.


3. Apiculture

In apiculture, bees produce rectified honey and pure beeswax from a variety of flowers. 

The types of bees include wild bees like rock bees which cannot be tamed, and bush bees which can be tamed. Specially bred bees should be encouraged, but wild bees should not be prevented from entering our gardens. All bees, including wild bees, should be allowed in our gardens.

Bee boxes can be located near oil-seeds, flower gardens, neem trees, Indian olives and grapes. The honey in the bee boxes should be collected regularly. In Bengal the period of maximum flowering for these plants is March, April, May and June.

Floral nectar can be collected directly from some special flowers which naturally produce honey. More research on all kinds of floral honey should be done.


## Dairy Farming

Dairy farming includes milk production from dairy cows, goats, sheep and buffaloes. Milk powder and dehydrated curd should also be produced. Animals are not to be sold for slaughter.


## Irrigation

Irrigation is also an important aspect of farming. 

As a principle, subterranean water should not be used for irrigation purposes. Subterranean water should not be disturbed, otherwise the level of the water-table will drop, leading to an acute shortage of water. 

The best system is to collect surface water. The rainwater, even from light showers, should be collected where it falls. If the huge reserves of water under some deserts are harnessed, it may do more harm than good. It is always better to conserve surface water.


Desert reclamation requires:
- water conservation
- irrigation
- afforestation
 

In the Thar Desert of India, a canal has been constructed to bring water from the Ganges to irrigate the land. The Ganga Nagar area has been reclaimed and is now producing a lot of wheat. 

The canal can be extended even further into the desert. Conserving surface water is the best method of irrigation and is preferable to exploiting underground water reserves.

Ecologists claim that some deserts are essential for keeping the global ecology in a balanced state. 
- The high day temperatures and the cold night temperatures in desert regions create a useful effect. 
- The hot dry desert air rises and creates a vacuum which sucks in other air, such as moist air from the sea. This causes rainfall. 

They say that if deserts vanish entirely, the overall rainfall will be reduced.

But certain plants can attract rain clouds. Examples are:
- sirisha [Albizzia lebbeck benth.]
- shisu [Dalbergia sissoo Roxb.]
- Himalayan white oak [Quercus incana Roxb.]
- ferns

They also create a congenial environment for other plants.


## Pisciculture

Fish should be cultivated in lakes, dams and ponds because they help conserve and purify the water. 

Small fish can also be cultivated in the paddy fields during the rainy season. 

Fish are the natural food of birds, so they are an essential part of a balanced ecology.



## Pest Control

In the rainy season in the last week of Shrávańa there is water in the paddy fields of Bengal. 

In these fields we should cultivate fish, but fishermen should not be allowed to catch these fish while the paddy is still growing. Harmful insecticides or pesticides should not be used in these fields because they will kill the fish and pollute the water system.

Alternative pesticides like neem paste pesticide should be used. 

If copper sulphate spray is used, care should be taken to use the minimum amount because it is harmful. 

Neem paste can be prepared from neem leaves. Before planting the paddy, during the last ploughing, neem oil cakes should be ploughed into the fields. 

In addition, neem paste pesticide with urea should be used whenever there is an attack of insects. Copper sulphate solution can also be mixed with urea.

Fish should not be the food of human beings, but the food of jackals, birds, foxes and other fish and crabs. 

If the paddy water drains into ponds, lakes or rivers, small fish will flourish and become the food of larger fish, birds and animals. In this way the farmers will be helping maintain ecological balance.

<!-- Some special medicines can be prepared for particular crops. For example,  -->

To kill the worms which attack cauliflower crops, soapy water mixed with a small amount of kerosene may be sprayed on the cauliflowers. The soapy water will let the kerosene wash off the cauliflowers easily and not harm humans.

Snakes will likely be found wherever wax gourd is cultivated. 

To avoid this, iishanmula [Aristolochia indica Linn.] is used because snakes are afraid of its smell. Snakes are also afraid of any copper salt. Wherever there is copper salt snakes will not be found, as in Ghatshila and Maobhandar, near Tatanagar. 

Water kept in a bronze pot becomes antiseptic due to the copper in the bronze. Copper sulphate is poisonous for human beings.
