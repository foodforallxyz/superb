<!-- Psycho-Spiritual Parallelism -->

The Cosmic Consciousness acts as the witnessing entity with the help of His Citishakti. 

The wavelength of this Citishakti is infinite. So we say that it flows in a straight line. 

When the mind or manah takes the átman – the witnessing entity of the unit mind – as its so-called object (this is to be done by complete surrender – there is no other way because actually the mind is the object of the átman), the mental waves will get straightened gradually.

In the end, when its wavelength will, as well, become infinite, and those waves will also flow in a straight line, the mind will get transformed into the átman. This state is called samádhi. 

Here the psychic waves have attained a parallelism with the spiritual waves of the átman. This psycho-spiritual parallelism is known as “idea”, or bháva. When this bháva or idea is conceived on the psychic level, it is “ideology”.

Ideology, therefore, is merely the conception of idea.

Hence when we call some materialistic or political principles of a person, party, nation or federation an “ideology”, it is a wrong use of the term. 

“Ideology” involves in it a spiritual sense. It is an inspiration which has a parallelism with the Spiritual Entity.

Shabda or sound is in its initial stage a psychic wave. 

Let us see what artha, or meaning, is.

We hear a sound, but the concept of the word uttered is not clear till the mental waves are brought in contact with the physical concept involved. 

A child hears the word “cat”. He sees a cat and the mother says, “See, my son! That is the cat which drank your milk yesterday.” The boy associates the word “cat” with the cat seen.

That means he establishes a parallelism between:
- the mental waves created by uttering the word “cat” and
- the physical wave coming from the physical form of the cat. 

Hence, psycho-physical parallelism is the meaning of a word which itself (the word) is a psychic wave. 

So psycho-spiritual parallelism is idea and psycho-physical parallelism is artha, or meaning.

This psycho-physical parallelism can be either direct or indirect.

Indirect parallelism will be the case when the object expressed in the word (psychic wave) is not perceived directly and thus physical parallelism cannot be made directly, but the physical parallelism has been made with the help of some internal saḿskára already formed or through some description made by some other source.

Psycho-physical parallelism always tends to make the psychic waves cruder. If the mental wave gets cruder, human beings will be transformed into cruder beings. They take the path of negative pratisaiṋcara. <!-- and spiritual elevation will remain a dream. --> 

But in daily life, we must establish psycho-physical parallelism. But this does not mean that human destiny sealed for ever. 

**We can have a supreme position of the spiritual wave over the physical wave and perceive the latter as one of the manifestations of the spiritual infinite one.**

This is what we mean by Brahmacarya -- it is the assimilation of the psychic wave of the unit mind into the eternal waves of the Macrocosm. 

We give a <!-- Ananda Marga lays down for the spiritual aspirant a --> practical method for this spiritual imposition to prevent the mental waves from becoming cruder. 

Rather by spiritual practice of auto-suggestion (bháva sádhaná) at the time of action laid down by Ananda Marga, the mind will tend towards Brahmacarya and thereby towards psycho-spiritual parallelism, the only way to ultimate liberation. 

To attain mental liberation, the psychic waves must be made subtler. This is only possible by:
- entertaining only subtler mental waves or
- an inspiring spiritual force that makes the mental waves parallel with spiritual ones.

Complete development of the integrated personality is essential for perfect spiritual realization of the human being. 


## Personality

Personality includes all three:

1. The physical body or jad́ádhára
2. The mental body or bhávádhára
3. The spiritual or supramental body, or cetanádhára. 

Personality is a collaborated composition of physical, metaphysical and spiritual bodies. So the proper development of each is essential.

For the physical, there must be proper nourishment (for this, see Ananda Marga Caryácarya Part 3, where food habits for spiritual aspirants and others have been dealt with). 

Struggle in the physical field or physical labour helps in purifying the physical structure. The mental or metaphysical body needs physical and mental struggle and also mental food. 

Mental struggle results from aggressive adoption of newer and progressive thoughts rather than blind clinging to faiths devoid of any rationality, simply because they prevailed in ancient days and were supported by our forefathers. Mental food can be had from ideas (ideas meaning psycho-spiritual parallelism). 

The spiritual body is the higher mind, subtler taste or higher taste. When the microcosm keeps itself absorbed in the Macrocosm, the meaner and cruder thoughts wave away. The spiritual body gets strengthened by longing for the Great – an intense desire to be for Him. This is the real bhakti or devotion. 

This is the ultimate and only way to final liberation or final union.

Shrii Shrii Shankaracharya has declared bhakti as the best way to mokśa.<!--  – the ultimate liberation: Mokśakárańa samagryáḿ bhaktireva gariiyasii. -->
