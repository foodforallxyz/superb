The kulakuńd́alinii, the “coiled serpentine”, is the theoretical negative force of the unit body. 

This is why it is different for each individual.

Its fundamental negativity tends towards the final merger into <!-- Puruśa --> Consciousness for liberation.<!--  attaining mokśa, is called . -->


The sádhaná is for a psycho-physical liberation in the initial stage. Its starting-point must be in the crudest manifestation. 

It must reside in that portion of the physical body from which the crudest matter (kśititattva) of the body is controlled. 

The starting-point of the kulakuńd́alinii, therefore, is in the múládhára chakra. 

It is fundamentally negative in character, and its starting-point is the negative kámabiija of the living being, just as the point from which the positive resultant force of Prakrti got expression is the kámabiija, or icchábiija, of the Cosmic Being.

The arena in which the kulakuńd́alinii resides is known as káma-piitha. 

The starting-point of the fundamental positivity, that is, the kámabiija of the Cosmic Being, is on the back of Shambhúliuṋga, and that of negativity on the back of Svayambhúliuṋga. 


A yoga sádhaka is one who practises the scientific method of spiritual approach with the help of this kulakuńd́alinii

Within the self of the yoga sádhaka, the force of fundamental negativity fights out and aggressively rises up against the force of Avidyámáyá and thereby gets domination over the flow of fundamental positivity. 

This path of non-compromising aggressive spirituality is the only way to ultimate oneness with Infinite Consciousness.
