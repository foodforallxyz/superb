Due to internal clash and cohesion amongst the 3 immanent principles (sentient, mutative and static), the resultant force bursts out at any one vertex of the triangle formed due to the ever-flowing eternal force.


## Saiṋcara

Consciousness (Puruśa) is the Nucleus from Whom commences the process of saiṋcara, or uniform movement from:
- the subtle to the gross
- the one to the many. 

The increasing crudeness results in:
- Mahattattva
- Ahaḿtattva
- citta 

Mind is born at the stage where all 3 are present.

The original entity is the unqualified undivided Macrocosm. By further crudification, the citta gets metamorphosed into 5 fundamental factors:

1. ethereal
2. aerial
3. luminous
4. liquid
5. solid. 


Right from the Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> to the crudest solid, there is no change in Puruśadeha. 

The action and interaction of the 3 forces of Prakrti cause a change in appearance whereby the Transcendent Entity appears to have lost its transcendentality. <!-- This phase of evolution is called saiṋcara, --> 

Saincara is:
- a stage of the Cosmic Mind
- the inanimate phase of creation.<!-- , and represents the Cosmic Mind, or Macrocosm, in different stages.  -->


## Pratisaiṋcara

In the living bodies after the formation of crudest <!-- kśititattva, or --> solid factor, division and association of matter result in the formation of mind. The process of pratisaiṋcara commences at this point. 

It is:
- the counter-movement wherein the unit mind gets dilated ever-increasingly, the volume and mass of the unit mind increases due to increasing reflection of Cosmic Consciousness. 
- the cycle for the unit to progress from the crude to the subtle. 
- where matter gets decimated continuously, until in the end, the unit mind achieves mental liberation. This is called "savikalpa samádhi".


Throughout pratisaiṋcara, the unit mind or microcosm exists in different stages. 

<!-- Thus the inanimate phase of creation, or saiṋcara, , and the animate phase of  -->

Pratisaiṋcara is:
- the stage of unit minds.

Each and every atom and molecule of the Macrocosm is nothing but the Macrocosmic Nucleus.<!--  Puruśottama. --> It is He who radiates Himself everywhere, also as <!-- . ; it is He who is omnipresent as the --> the witnessing entity. 

The sun by its radiation pervades the solar system, so does Puruśottama <!-- His system --> by His Citishakti. Thus, in the Cosmic Mind, both the radiated stuff and the witnessing entity are Puruśottama Himself.


In pratisaiṋcara, <!-- the second phase of evolution, that is, --> at the different stages of the unit mind, Puruśottama is the witnessing entity with all other objects being crude derivatives of citta. 

In the phases both of saiṋcara and pratisaiṋcara, Puruśottama is the Consciousness. He witnesses the microcosms and Macrocosm. **Puruśottama is, therefore, also called “Collective Consciousness”.**

As witnessing entity, Puruśottama connects Himself to his mental object with the help of His Avidyámáyá and reflects Himself on the object as Citishakti. This reflection is not like a reflection in a mirror but an associative reflection like the rays of the sun. 

- "Prota yoga" is the association of Puruśottama with the Cosmic Mind, whereby He functions as the witnessing entity
  - His association with the unit minds in collectivity is also called prota yoga. 
- "Ota yoga" association of Puruśottama with the unit minds separately and individually, whereby He functions as the witnessing entity for each individual unit mind 


Thus, in saiṋcara there is only prota yoga but in pratisaiṋcara has both prota and ota yoga.
