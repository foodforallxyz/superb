Saccidánanda has 3 terms, wrongly translated as:
- sat: existence
- cit: knowledge
- ánanda: bliss 

The correct translation is:
- sat: a Transcendental Entity that undergoes no change
- chit: consciousness
- ananda: divine bliss

<!--  sat means “ – . “Existence” is a relative term and conveys the sense of existence under certain relative conditions of time, place and person. Sat implies “unchangeable”.  -->

The Transcendental Entity may appear to undergo a metamorphosis but actually undergoes no qualitative change. Hence, Sat can only mean the Transcendental Entity – an absolute entity which undergoes no change.

Ananda is divine bliss experienced subjectively and not in an objective manner.

The power of cit created the Cosmos. The unit mind experiences or activates created substance through this power. 

This subjectivation is only due to the Consciousness or Citishakti in Brahma.

Saguńa Brahma includes in Itself all of:
- microcosm
- Macrocosm
- Puruśottama
- Paramátman. 

The whole Cosmos in Saguńa Brahma is the thought-projection of the Macrocosm. 

## The process of perception 

<!-- of different objects in the Cosmos by the microcosm. -->

The microcosm has 10 organs:
- 5 sensory 
- 5 motor

Sensory organs receive tanmátras from the objects which are perceived. These organs or indriyas are, therefore, the knowers of these objects. 

In the next stage, through the afferent nerves, citta receives the quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> and takes the form of the object perceived. 

The Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> feels the subjectivity – “I perceive”. 
- But this subjectivity itself depends on the existence of “I”, because one cannot work unless one feels that one exists. 
- “I” exists first and then the “I” works. 

This feeling of existence is the Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva -->. The combination of both layers <!--  ahaḿtattva and mahattattva --> is the instrument for perceiving the quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> which have been brought in by the sense-organs. 

The mind is the combination of: <!-- (mahat, aham and citta) --> 
- Identity
- Ego-Identity
- Mindstuff

It is thus the knower and master of the sense-and-motor-organs<!--  indriyas --><!-- , that is why the mind is said to be the master of the organs. --> 

But the átman, or the unit consciousness, is the real knower, not the mind. It is:
- the master of functions
- the witness of these functions being performed
- the witness of Identity <!-- mahattattva -->

<!-- “I exist,” “I do,” and done “I” are functional forms.  -->

<!-- There is another entity who is . This witnessing entity is the .  -->

<!-- The knower of the mind itself is the átman. Hence the ultimate knowership (jiṋátrtva) lies in the átman and not in the mind;  -->

The átman, or the reflected consciousness on the unit psychic plate, is:
- the active element
- the witnessing entity. 

The átman knows because it is an active participant in the function of the mind.

The function of the 5 motor organs is to activate tanmátras. 

The organs work by translating their potentialities into action with the help of the out-going quantum-perceptions <!-- tanmátras --> radiated through the motor nerves, which (the motor nerves) in their turn receive the <!-- tanmátras --> quantum-perceptions from the mind. 

So it seems that the doership lies in the mind and not in the motor organs. 

The real doership cannot be established without the átman, who witnesses that the mind is activating the internal saḿskáras, or accumulated momenta, in the form of tanmátras. 

**The átman is not active. But it is due to the átman – due to its omnipresence – that the mind is able to work.** 

To this extent, the knowership or doership lies in the átman. <!-- The átman itself does not work, but its existence is the ultimate cause of knowing and doing. -->

Any object first exists in the sense-organ. ; on further introspection it depends on the existence of the organ within the scope of the mind; and ultimately the real knowership or doership is established in the átman. 

The ultimate existence of the mind is itself in the átman. Thus, the ultimate knowership, doership and existence are in the átman. The collective name for the 3 is “witnessing entity”.

The mind is nothing but a state of never-ending clash amongst 3 combined principles [static, mutative, sentient].

These correlated belligerent combined principles <!-- are the main attributes --> lead to the formation of the mind.

<!-- As the mind is only a never-ending clash and an ever-changing relative functional organism, there must be  -->

An absolute entity witnesses the mind in all the aspects of time, in all the dimensions of space and in all forms – physical and psychic.

This witnessing entity is the átman. <!-- , and the mind is only the result of ever-changing functional metamorphosis. --> It exists at all stages in Brahma Cakra. 

In saiṋcara, the Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> acts as the witnessing entity of the Cosmic Mind. 

The Átman of the Macrocosm is, therefore, <!-- Puruśottama --> the Macrocosmic Nucleus Himself.

In pratisaiṋcara, <!-- Puruśottama -->the Macrocosmic Nucleus by His ota yoga reflects associatively on the microcosm. The reflection in each mental plate is the jiivátman, the witnessing entity of the unit mind. The átman is not an active counterpart.

<!-- The mind is an ever-changing functional organism and so it must have a momentum. 

From where does the mind derive this momentum?  -->
