## Reflection Leads to the Physical, Psychic, and Spiritual Forces

The movement of the unit mind accelerates proportional to the increase in the reflection of Supreme Consciousness <!-- or Puruśottama --> on its <!-- the unit --> mental plate. 

As a result of this<!--  gradual increase in the --> denser reflection, the crude mind is converted into subtler mind. 

Its mental scope increases as a psychic dilation. This dilation comes from clash, which leads to 3 operative forces:  <!-- As a result of the reflection of consciousness on the mental plate, the mind undergoes a . -->

1. Physical force, created out of physical clash
2. Psychic force, created as a result of clashes in the psychic sphere
3. Spiritual force emanated from longing for the Great

The resulting dilation is not mere puffing up, but an expansion in volume and mass. 

**The quantum of dilation depends directly on the proximity of the destination. This means the dilation increases as the distance decreases.**

The increase in mass is due to ever-increasing clash amongst the belligerent forces within the physical structure.

As a result of<!--  mental dilation, that is, --> the increase in volume and mass of the psychic body caused by the longing for the Great:
- the crude mind grows subtler
- the mind acquires more potentiality for multilateral activities
- the physical body also gets metamorphosed as it adjusts for the higher psychic demands
<!-- According to the mental dilation,  -->

This is why creatures with developed feelings have <!--   is a composite structure of a large number of --> many glands with peculiar activities. 
- **This glandular complexity is essential for facing the psychic clashes in subtler spheres**.

The increase in subtlety in the unit citta develops its capacity to realize its subjectivity. 
- The subtler is the stage of animation pratisaiṋcara, the more developed its ego becomes
- Later on, it can feel and determine the trend of all its movements. 


At this stage, the evolved unit mind develops ego and willpower. 
- It can use the momentum (saḿvega) acquired during its previous movement in any direction according to its desire. 

Before the development of will and ego, expression of the self in a constructive line is not possible. **Hence in plant and animal life, where mind is underdeveloped, the vital energy and mind are <!-- guided and --> controlled by the will of the Supreme Mind, the Great Ego.** 

These underdeveloped plants and creatures can have definite progress in pratisaiṋcara because they are controlled by the will of the Supreme Ego. By the guidance of Vidyámáyá, such a unit mind constantly rises higher and higher. 

But after will is developed, <!--  within its scope of activities and a special momentum is acquired, --> the unit mind can choose any direction it wants. 
- It can follow <!-- adopt a course of --> negative pratisaiṋcara. 

<!-- This stage of mental evolution, when the developed ego decides the direction and can move even towards jad́a (negative pratisaiṋcara) is called  -->

The “human being” or mánuśa is the stage when the ego decides direction. 
- The ego develops a feeling that it has a mind and a mental force which it can use. <!--  to serve its purpose. -->

In the earlier stages, only the will-force of the Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Great, that is, of Puruśottama alone, --> acts.
- But at the stage of human development, the thought-waves of the One and those of the many work together.
- Here the will of the Macrocosm and the will of the microcosm co-exist in the ego.  

<!-- The Macrocosm exerts and expresses itself both directly and through the microcosms. 

Those microcosms determine, by individual will, their paths of movement. 

Thus, the inanimate phase of creation moves by the psychic impetus of Puruśottama only; while in the animate phase, there is the imagination of One and that of many as well.  -->

In the non-human animate world, the cooperation between unit and Cosmic Mind is subordinate and not coordinate. The unit minds work in a subordinated cooperation with the Cosmic Mind. 

But in human spheres, the cooperation can be of both coordinated and subordinated.

The human being, mánuśa, has ego. This ego accumulates past experiences and past lives. <!--  undergone during that person’s past living stages.  -->
- That person’s living momentum knows nothing about the phases ahead. 

The momentum of previous lives naturally creates a longing for material happiness, or love for jad́a.
- People remain unaware of the love of Consciousness, as this stage or path is untrodden by them. 

Who wants to take the unknown risk of an untrodden path? 

One who has a longing for jad́a lacks the courage to:
- experiment with spiritual truth
- follow the path shown by the rśis.

Ordinarily, people do not follow this brave path. Instead, they ask some superhuman help for their carnal pleasures. 
- They create imaginary gods or are misled into worshipping the mental creations of others to feel satisfied. 
- These are all worships of jad́atá, or the crude.


## Negative Pratisaiṋcara as a Way to the Supreme

As a fundamental property, the mindstuff takes the form of the object it entertains. 

The constant superimposition of physical entities and mundane waves on the psychic body causes the mental waves to adjust and take the length of the material waves, which represent a cruder psychic projection.
- **For the sake of psycho-physical parallelism, such a crude mind chooses a physical structure cruder than its previous structure.** 
- This backward movement is negative or counter-pratisaiṋcara.

In this negative pratisaiṋcara, the unit mind can have a backward jump. The change in mental wavelength causes the physical structure to take the form of:
- a tree
- an underdeveloped metazoan
- a protozoan or 
- an inanimate object such as stone, gold, or silver. 

The mental structure of the money-minded capitalist may convert itself into a dollar bill. <!-- paper note of that person’s choice. -->

Even at this stage, <!-- after this retracing of the destined path, --> the ever-merciful Macrocosm helps the ego-lost mind. Under the external pressure and internal clash, its evolution or movement towards pratisaiṋcara restarts and the unit mind regains its<!--  lost --> proper status. 

**However, it might take millions of years to place it back in such a proper status.**

If the unit mind at that stage of evolution directs its potentialities towards longing for the Great, then it can accelerate its progress towards the Macrocosmic Nucleus.

<!-- It is not that a human has the chance of negative pratisaiṋcara only, due to his or her evolved ego. This ego renders a positive help in the movement towards Puruśottama. 

In the animate phase, the imagination of many unit minds works in harmony with the Supreme One.  -->

Its progress can be many times faster than when it was a crude new mind without self-will. 

<!-- what it was at the stages where the citta, being in the crudest form, had not developed self-will but had to move according to the desire of the Macrocosm.  -->


## Yoga or Union

<!-- In this march towards the supramundane, the unit mind gradually feels a closer touch of Puruśottama. 

As the proximity of the two increases, -->

Eventually, the psychic gap between the reflected consciousness and the reflecting plate goes on diminishing and finally these two merge. 

This supreme union of Puruśottama and the unit mind is known as yoga: *Saḿyogo yogo ityukto jiivátmá Paramátmanah*.

According to the urge of pratisaiṋcara, the unit mind goes on dilating because of the ever-increasing reflected density of the Macrocosmic Nucleus. 

Here, the microcosm acts as a mirror and the reflected consciousness is just like the reflection of the rays of the sun. While being reflected, He also associates Himself with the plate. 

The association inculcates the sameness of the quality and so the associative reflection of the Nucleus – Puruśottama – will develop in the unit mind the broadness of His Cosmic Self and the final culmination of the march of this unitary self, or microcosm. 

The sameness and merger of the unit and the Cosmic Mind leads to <!--  is established. The finality in association will result in the merger of the microcosm into Macrocosm. This is called --> liberation or *mukti*.

Thus if the finite subjectivity (unit mind) dwells on the infinite one as its objectivity, it results in the gradual expansion of its self. This enlarged mind finally merges with Puruśottama. 

<!-- Hence, such a stage is nothing but mental liberation.  -->

Our psycho-philosophic theory is: “Oneness in objectivity results in oneness in subjectivity.” 

- The jiivátman is the subject of the microcosm.
- The Macrocosmic Nucleus is the subject of the Macrocosm.


The jiivátman transforms into the Macrocosmic Nucleus when the unit's objectivity [as the Cosmic Mind] is converted into the Macrocosm's objectivity [the actual Cosmic Mind].



  <!-- the subject of the Macrocosm. -->

The fundamental principle of our Iishvara Prańidhána is based on this psycho-spiritual theory.
