Publisher's Note
Jamalpur, Bihar, is the eastern Indian town where the socio-spiritual organization Ánanda Márga Pracáraka Saḿgha was founded in 1955. Jamalpur had previously been known for its large railway workshop, at one time the largest in Asia, established during the British period. Here, in the summer of 1959, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, the founder-president of Ananda Marga, gave a remarkable series of lectures to a small group of his followers. The lectures were given in a mixture of English and Hindi.
At the conclusion of the seminar, the notes of the participants were assembled and edited into an English manuscript. The manuscript was then sent to the author for any necessary additions and alterations; thereafter it was published in book form.
Like no other book, but rather like spiritual practice itself, Idea and Ideology methodically, in a careful sequence, expands the reader’s horizons and mind. It concludes by using the spiritual vantage that has been gained, to focus on the social problems of the earth. (The concise socio-economic precepts known as the Five Fundamental Principles of Prout made their first appearance, at least in published form, in this book.)
The author classified Idea and Ideology, together with Ánanda Sútram, as the darshana shástra, or philosophical treatise, of Ananda Marga. Ánanda Sútram, dictated by the author two years after the Idea and Ideology seminar, is a collection of Sanskrit aphorisms with terse explanations. Though its style of presentation is quite different from that of Idea and Ideology, its subject matter and order of topics closely resemble the Idea and Ideology pattern.
The second, third and fourth editions of Idea and Ideology involved only minor grammatical alterations of the first edition. At the time of the drafting of the fifth edition in 1978, certain grammatical changes were made with the express approval of the author. These changes related to passages where initially the meaning was not completely clear, and where therefore to edit the grammar might affect the meaning.
The sixth edition involved no change from the fifth edition. The present, seventh, edition is the first annotated edition.
Readers comparing this edition to other recent editions will find on page 5 of this edition a sequence of nine words, and on page 81 another sequence of nine words, that did not appear in the fourth, fifth and sixth editions. These sequences of words appeared in the first three editions, but were inadvertently omitted thereafter.
Square brackets [    ] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (    ) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.

Saiṋcara is the centrifugal activity of the Macrocosmic Nucleus. 

Hence this Nucleus or Puruśottama is the witnessing counterpart of the objective Macrocosm. 

Puruśa or Citishakti is pure consciousness. Hence its activation without the presence of a second principle is impossible. 

Prakrti is the inherent tendency of the transcendental Puruśa. Action results only when Prakrti gets scope of expression.

The two factors are thus Puruśa and Prakrti. 

These are dual in theory but singular in spirit. Their collective body is just like that of fire. One cannot think of fire without its heat. 

In the same way, one cannot think of Puruśa without Prakrti in the collective body of Brahma.

Prakrti may be defined as an attribute of Puruśa. Puruśa remains objectless or nirguńa when  there is no expressed activity of Prakrti, that is, where activity is dormant. 


This Prakrti is also a collection of 3 immanent principles:

1. The sentient or sattva: This is the cause of pure “I” feeling
2. The mutative or rajah: This activates “I”* and transforms it into the Doer “I”
3. The static or tamah: This causes the mutative ego to <!-- imbibe the results of actions of the Doer “I”, that is, by --> create the done “I” out of the Doer “I” as the results of the latter

> *Superphysics note: This is the 'me' of Descartes


<!-- . Prakrti is the collective name of these three principles. -->

In Nirguńa Brahma, the activity of Prakrti is dormant. She cannot manifest Herself, though the eternal flow exists. 

Thus, the flow of Prakrti means the flow of 3 belligerent forces. 

Mathematically speaking, this fight results in a triangle of forces. Puruśa or Shiva at this stage gets encircled by Shivánii (here Prakrti is called Shivánii) as a triangle of forces.

The internal clash and cohesion of these 3 immanent principles causes creation to come out from a point in any one of the vertices of the triangle of forces. 

The Puruśa or consciousness at the vertex where creation came out is known as Shambhú. The central point of the triangle is Puruśottama. 

Puruśottama is the subjectivated Shiva and is the nucleus of all the creative principles.

The movement which starts from Puruśottama as the centre is an exterial or centrifugal. It changes from the subtle to the crude and is called Saiṋcara. <!--  is the name given to this particular movement in the spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga. --> It comes out from Shambhú as a never-ending process.

The vertices of the triangle of forces are points having certain positions but no absolute movement. It is a stage of stagnancy and hence dominated by the static principle. 

The static force is a crudifying factor. 

The mutative force overcomes the static force. It causes a stir of expression on the static seed. This expression is logically and scientifically is:
- unfathomable in gravity
- sentient in tendency

## Pure 'I'

Thus, Prakrti expresses Herself as the resultant force that starts saiṋcara. This Prakrti is sentient, though rudimentally static. It creates the “I” feeling in Puruśa. 

It is a pure “I” feeling because sentient Prakrti cannot go any further. 

This stage is known as Mahattattva which is nothing but the Cosmic “I”. This is the first bondage of Puruśa by His innate sentient Prakrti.

This bondage is located in a microscopic fraction of His universal body. But it is not felt as a bondage because of its looseness. Hence it is merely theoretical. 

The Puruśa in Mahattattva undergoes only the slightest metamorphosis. 


## Doer 'I'

As the movement of saiṋcara proceeds further, sentient Prakrti is gradually transformed into the mutative principle due to internal clash. 

This mutation causes the feeling of second subjectivity. This transforms the Cosmic “I” into the Cosmic Doer “I” under the influence of Prakrti's mutative principle. 

This Cosmic Doer “I” is known as Ahaḿtattva. Here the bondage of Prakrti on Puruśa is more prominent than that in Mahattattva. But it still is subjective (second subjective) in character because Puruśa still gets no objectivity. 

This bondage of Mahattattva is therefore theoretical.

Ahaḿtattva, from a psychological point of view, is the activated counterpart of the subjective “I” with the subjectivation being done by mutative Prakrti. 

The metamorphosis of Puruśa in the Ahaḿtattva is still highly subtle because no objective entity is still created. Ahaḿtattva exists only in subjective strata.

As the static principle starts its domination, Ahaḿtattva gets objectivated. This cruder stage in the process of saiṋcara is known as **citta**. 

Objectivation takes place because the static principle, influencing Ahaḿtattva, forces it to assume the form of the result of the final activation. 

It is the Cosmic Subjective “I” which, after being partially transformed into the Cosmic Doer “I”, is finally forced to convert a portion of it into the Cosmic objective “I”. 

Here Puruśa undergoes an objective change, and so the metamorphosed stage is an objectivated form of the subjectivated “I”, and also of Supreme Consciousness. It is not only that the Cosmic Doer “I” has performed a psychic function under the influence of mutative Prakrti, but a portion of the Doer “I” or Ahaḿtattva has imbibed the result of its own action and thus gets objectivated under the influence of static Prakrti. 

Here, Puruśa feels the bondage as an objective reality and this Doer Puruśabháva [coming under] the influence of the static principle is the Cosmic citta. This citta is an objective reality, its immediate mental subjectivity being the Ahaḿtattva and supreme mental subjectivity the Mahattattva. 

"Mind" is the collective name of Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva and citta. Its subjective counterpart is the Cosmic Puruśa.

The process of saiṋcara still continues under the increasing domination of static Prakrti.
- Puruśottama transforms into Mahattattva
- Mahattattva transforms into Ahaḿtattva
- Ahaḿtattva transforms into citta

<!-- owing to the influence of one or the other aspect of Prakrti.  -->

Citta under the influence of static Prakrti gets cruder. At a later stage, it is transformed into the ethereal entity. 

The pressure and domination of the static principle continue increasingly, and as a result of this increasing external pressure the external space within that structural scope goes on decreasing gradually. 

There is also simultaneous increase in chemical affinity. The gradual crudification results in four specific factors other than the ethereal one. They are the aerial, luminous, liquid and solid. 

The solid factor is the crudest manifestation of the Cosmic citta. It is where the pressure of the static Prakrti on the Cosmic citta reaches the zenith of its capacity.

The external pressure of static Prakrti on those 5 factors is known as bala. 

As a result of this bala, 2 opposing forces develop:
- centrifugal force
  - This has tries to split up the object into thousands
- centripetal force
  - This is the centre-seeking or interial force that tries to maintain the object's structural solidarity


The collective name of these exterial and interial forces is **práńa** or "energy". 

Every solid factor has práńa which is the eternal game between the Cosmic cause and its crudest effect.

<!-- In práńa there exists an internal clash in which  -->

Either of the 2 active forces may win. 
- if the <!-- interial --> centripetal forces win, then a nucleus is formed within the solid factor. This leads to a solid structure. The maintenance of its physical solidarity depends on the bala or external pressure. 
<!-- that is, if the resultant force created happens to be interial in character, -->
- if the <!-- exterial --> centrifugal forces win, no nucleus is formed

<!-- the resultant exterial cannot form any nucleus within that physical structure. The resultant interial force is, therefore, the only factor that can create a nucleus within a solid body and thereby maintain its structural solidarity.  -->

Even if the unit's structural solidarity is maintained, there can be spaces within the unit structure where the <!-- exterial --> divisive forces predominate over the reacting unifiers. <!-- interials --> 

In such a space, dissociation occurs. The spaces under the influence of a creative divisive <!-- resultant exterial --> force gets detached from the parent body. **This manifests as the wear and tear in the unit structure.** 


The physical deficiency caused by this wear and tear is compensated by the práńa we acquire from food, light, air, water, etc. 

<!-- > *Superphysics note: This means that the longevity of objects (anti-entrophy) is maintained by the unifying force -->


**The solidarity of our composite structure remains unchanged in spite of this wear and tear as long as the nucleus remains under the influence of the <!-- resultant interial --> creative unifying force.**
