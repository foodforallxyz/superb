Publisher's Note
Jamalpur, Bihar, is the eastern Indian town where the socio-spiritual organization Ánanda Márga Pracáraka Saḿgha was founded in 1955. Jamalpur had previously been known for its large railway workshop, at one time the largest in Asia, established during the British period. Here, in the summer of 1959, Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar, the founder-president of Ananda Marga, gave a remarkable series of lectures to a small group of his followers. The lectures were given in a mixture of English and Hindi.
At the conclusion of the seminar, the notes of the participants were assembled and edited into an English manuscript. The manuscript was then sent to the author for any necessary additions and alterations; thereafter it was published in book form.
Like no other book, but rather like spiritual practice itself, Idea and Ideology methodically, in a careful sequence, expands the reader’s horizons and mind. It concludes by using the spiritual vantage that has been gained, to focus on the social problems of the earth. (The concise socio-economic precepts known as the Five Fundamental Principles of Prout made their first appearance, at least in published form, in this book.)
The author classified Idea and Ideology, together with Ánanda Sútram, as the darshana shástra, or philosophical treatise, of Ananda Marga. Ánanda Sútram, dictated by the author two years after the Idea and Ideology seminar, is a collection of Sanskrit aphorisms with terse explanations. Though its style of presentation is quite different from that of Idea and Ideology, its subject matter and order of topics closely resemble the Idea and Ideology pattern.
The second, third and fourth editions of Idea and Ideology involved only minor grammatical alterations of the first edition. At the time of the drafting of the fifth edition in 1978, certain grammatical changes were made with the express approval of the author. These changes related to passages where initially the meaning was not completely clear, and where therefore to edit the grammar might affect the meaning.
The sixth edition involved no change from the fifth edition. The present, seventh, edition is the first annotated edition.
Readers comparing this edition to other recent editions will find on page 5 of this edition a sequence of nine words, and on page 81 another sequence of nine words, that did not appear in the fourth, fifth and sixth editions. These sequences of words appeared in the first three editions, but were inadvertently omitted thereafter.
Square brackets [    ] in the text are used to indicate translations by the editors or other editorial insertions. Round brackets (    ) indicate a word or words originally given by the author.

Crudfication or Saiṋcara is the centrifugal activity of the Nucleus (Puruśottama) of the Macrocosm. This Nucleus is the center, witness, or subject of the Macrocosm which is Its periphery, experience, or object.

 <!-- or the makes the Hence this Macrocosmic Nucleus or  is --> <!-- which witnesses  counterpart of the objective Macrocosm. --> 

<!-- Puruśa or Citishakti (power of mind) is  -->

This Nucleus is the Principle of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness. 

<!-- Prakrti --> The Principle of Activity is the **inherent** tendency of the transcendental <!-- Puruśa -->Principle of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness. Hence, the activation of <!-- Pure --> Consciousness without the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> <!-- the presence of a second principle --> is impossible. 

Action results only when the Principle of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> gets a chance to express itself. <!-- scope of expression. -->

The two <!-- factors --> forces are thus:

1. <!-- Puruśa --> Consciousness
2. Activity (Prakrti)

These are dual in theory but singular in spirit. Their collective body is just like that of fire. One cannot think of fire without its heat. 

In the same way, one cannot think of Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> without Activity <!-- Prakrti --> in the collective body of Existence (Brahma).

Activity <!-- Prakrti --> may thus be defined as an attribute of Consciousness. Activity is feminine, while Consciousness is masculine. <!--  Puruśa. --> 

Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> remains objectless <!-- or nirguńa --> when it has no Activity. <!-- We say that it ithere is no expressed activity of Prakrti, that is, where activity is dormant.  -->


This <!-- Prakrti --> Activity is also a collective flow of 3 immanent principles:

1. Sentient<!-- or sattva -->: This creates the identity or ego or pure “I” feeling
2. Mutative or rajah: This transforms identity into an active identity as the Doer “I” or active ego
3. Static or tamah: This causes the <!-- mutative --> ego to <!-- imbibe the results of actions of the Doer “I”, that is, by --> create the ego-effect <!-- done “I” out --> from the action of the <!-- of the Doer “I” as the results of the latter --> active ego*

> *Superphysics note: This is the 'me' of Descartes


<!-- . Prakrti is the collective name of these three principles. -->

In Objectless Existence (Nirguńa Brahma), Activity <!-- of Prakrti --> is dormant. She cannot manifest Herself, though the eternal flow exists. 

Thus, the flow of Activity <!-- Prakrti --> means the flow of 3 belligerent forces. 

Mathematically speaking, this fight results in a triangle of forces. Consciousness <!-- Puruśa or Shiva --> at this stage gets encircled by Activity <!-- Shivánii (here Prakrti is called Shivánii) --> as a triangle of forces.


## Crudification (Saiṋcara)

The internal clash and cohesion of these 3 immanent principles causes creation to come out from a point in any one of the vertices of the triangle of Active forces. 
- The Macrocosmic Nucleus is the center of the triangle. 
- The Vertex (Shambhú) is the point in Consciousness where creation comes out.

<!--  is the Puruśa or consciousness at the vertex . The central point of the triangle is the  -->

The Macrocosmic Nucleus is:
- the subjectivated Consciousness <!-- Shiva --> and 
- the center of all the creative principles.

The movement which starts from this Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> <!-- as the centre --> is <!-- an exterial --> divisive or centrifugal. It changes from subtle to crude and is called The Crudification Cycle<!--  Saiṋcara -->. <!--  is the name given to this particular movement in the spiritual philosophy of Ananda Marga. --> It comes out from the Vertex <!-- Shambhú --> as a never-ending process.

The vertices of the triangle of forces are points having certain positions, but no absolute movement. **It is a stage of stagnancy and hence dominated by the static principle.** 

The static force is a crudifying factor. 

The mutative force overcomes the static force. It causes a stir of expression on the static seed. This expression is logically and scientifically is:
- unfathomable <!-- in gravity -->
- sentient in tendency


## The Cosmic Identity as Identity-Layer from Sentient Principle of Activity 
<!-- Prakrti -->

Thus, Activity <!-- Prakrti --> expresses Herself as the resultant force that starts crudification<!--  saiṋcara -->*. This Activity <!-- Prakrti --> is sentient, though rudimentally static. It creates the Pure “I” feeling in Consciousness<!--  Puruśa -->. 


> *Superphysics Note: Crudification<!--  Saincara --> is the start of the feelings


It is a pure “I” feeling because sentient Activity <!-- Prakrti --> cannot go any further. 

This stage is known as Identity-Layer (Mahattattva). 
- It is nothing but the Cosmic “I”
- This is the first bondage of Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> by His innate sentient Activity<!-- Prakrti -->.

```elixir
Cosmic Identity [The One] = Pure Consciousness + Sentient Principle of Activity
```

**This bondage is located in a microscopic fraction of His universal body**. 
- But it is not felt as a bondage because of its looseness
- Hence it is merely theoretical

The Consciousness in the Identity-Layer <!-- Mahattattva --> undergoes only the slightest metamorphosis. 


## Active 'I' as Ego-Layer from the Mutative Principle of Activity
<!-- Prakrti -->

As crudification goes on<!-- the movement of saiṋcara proceeds further -->, sentient Activity <!-- Prakrti --> is gradually transformed into mutative Activity <!-- principle --> due to internal clash. 
- **This mutation causes the feeling of a second subject.** 
- This transforms the Cosmic “I” into the Cosmic Doer or Active “I” under the influence of <!-- Prakrti's --> mutative Activity<!--  principle -->. 

```elixir
Cosmic Doer [The Active One] = Cosmic Identity + Mutative Activity
```

This Cosmic Active “I” is known as the Ego-Layer (Ahaḿtattva).
- Here, the bondage created by Activity <!-- Prakrti --> on Consciousness <!-- Puruśa --> is more prominent than that in the Identity-Layer<!--  Mahattattva -->
- But it still is subjective (second subjective) in character because Consciousness still has no objects
- This bondage felt by the Ego-Layer is therefore also theoretical.

<!-- Ahaḿtattva,  -->From a psychological point of view, the Ego-Layer is the activated counterpart of the subjective “I” <!-- with the subjectivation being done --> caused by mutative Activity<!--  Prakrti -->. 

The metamorphosis of Consciousness in the Ego-Layer <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> is still highly subtle because there are no objects yet. <!-- Ahaḿtattva --> Thus, the Ego-Layer exists only in subjective strata.
