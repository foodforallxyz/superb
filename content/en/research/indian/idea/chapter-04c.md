Mind is a state in the process of Brahma Cakra.
- It is the result of changing positions
- It is essentially a stage in the process of motion. 

This implies a momentum which mind has to express.
- To find expression, the mind adopts certain inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupations. 
- These occupations (love, hatred, fear, etc.) are known as propensities (vrtti). 

A propensity is “the way of expression of mind”. 
- On the psychic level this <!-- occupation --> is called “expressed sentiment” or feelings.
- The feelings <!-- Sentiments --> affecting subsidiary glands are known as “instincts”. 

“Subsidiary gland” means any gland other than the pineal and the pituitary. 

Some psychologists define “instinct” as “accumulated sentiment”. 
- By this, they imply that instincts are later stages of sentiments, that is, that instincts are created when sentiments get themselves habituated. 

This is a theoretical definition. 

A spiritual aspirant, who is a practical psychologist, realizes that instinct is a feeling affecting the subsidiary glands.
- These subsidiary glands are the sub-stations of organs whose main controlling station, as already discussed, is located in the brain. 


The mind is:
- "saḿkalpátmaka" when its internal feelings <!-- occupations --> lead towards the Great.
- "vikalpátmaka" when its feelings lead towards the mundane or crude

The help of the organs are needed for:
- the evolution of the saḿkalpátmaka and vikalpátmaka mind 
- the creation of external waves

This help is also essential for crude manifestation in the physical stratum and other multifarious activities.
- The subtle brain does not work directly. 
- It requires cruder sub-stations under its control.


Waves have to be developed for other manifestation of the internal reactive-momenta <!-- saḿskáras -->. **These waves have to be created in the nerves and in the blood.**

According to the sanguinary flow and strength of the nerves, sub-stations of the mind go on transmitting the waves.

**The seed of every propensity is in the brain.** 
- But the first expression occurs in the sub-station. 

Waves, after being created by the glands or sub-stations of the mind, are expressed outside through efferent nerves. 
- The motor organs work with the help of efferent nerves, but the secret of the working lies with these mental sub-stations or glands.

**The number of propensities varies according to the complexity of the physical structure.** 
- The more complex the structure, the greater the number of propensities. 
- More-developed animals, therefore, have more propensities than less-developed ones. 

Generally, there are 1,000 propensities in the human structure. 
- In their development and expression on the ordinary crude level, they are 50 in number. 
- This means that the 1,000 seeds of those propensities <!-- The collective number being one thousand, the seeds of all those thousand vrttis --> are present in the brain in the pineal gland. 
- This is why the yogis called it the sahasrára cakra (sahasra means “thousand”)

<!-- Because of the existence of these seeds of one thousand vrttis , the .  -->

- The subsidiary glands control 48 propensities. 
- The pituitary gland controls 2:
  - Saḿkalpátmaka, or one leading to parávidyá (knowledge of the Great)
  - Vikalpátmaka, relating to aparávidyá (knowledge of the mundane). 

The pineal as a structure controls all these 50 vrttis taken internally and externally by all 10 indriyas. 50 x 2 x 10 = 1,000.

Yogis having control over the sahasrára cakra attain nirvikalpa samádhi, a state where they are beyond the approach of all the vrttis. 

Within the scope of these vrttis lies the seed of saḿskára – good or bad. So the attainment of such a state means the end of all the saḿskára, exhaustion of all the previous momentum accumulated by the mind due to its previous journeys in Brahma Cakra. 

This is what is called mokśa – union with the Transcendentality.
