Mind is a state in the process of Brahma Cakra.
- It is the result of changing positions
- It is essentially a stage in the process of motion. This implies a momentum which it has to express.

To find expression, the mind adopts certain inter- and intra-ectoplasmic occupations. 

These occupations (love, hatred, fear, etc.) are known as vrtti. 
- Vrtti is “the way of expression of mind”. 
- On the psychic level this <!-- occupation --> is called “expressed sentiment” or feelings.

The feelings <!-- Sentiments --> affecting subsidiary glands are known as “instincts”. 

“Subsidiary gland” means any gland other than the pineal and the pituitary. 

Some psychologists define “instinct” as “accumulated sentiment”. By this they imply that instincts are later stages of sentiments, that is, that instincts are created when sentiments get themselves habituated. 

This is a theoretical definition. 

A sádhaka, who is a practical psychologist, realizes that instinct is a sentiment affecting the subsidiary glands.

These subsidiary glands are the sub-stations of organs whose main controlling station, as already discussed, is located in the brain. 


The mind is:
- "saḿkalpátmaka" when its internal feelings <!-- occupations --> lead towards the Great.
- "vikalpátmaka" when its feelings lead towards the mundane or crude

The help of the organs are needed for:
- the evolution of the saḿkalpátmaka and vikalpátmaka mind 
- the creation of external waves

This help is also essential for crude manifestation in the physical stratum and other multifarious activities. The subtle brain does not work directly. It requires cruder sub-stations under its control.


Waves have to be developed for other manifestation of the internal saḿskáras. **These waves have to be created in the nerves and in the blood.** 

According to the sanguinary flow and strength of the nerves, sub-stations of the mind go on transmitting the waves.

The seed of every vrtti is in the brain. But the first expression occurs in the sub-station. 

Waves, after being created by the glands or sub-stations of the mind, are expressed outside through efferent nerves. The motor organs work with the help of efferent nerves, but the secret of the working lies with these mental sub-stations or glands.

The number of vrttis varies according to the complexity of the physical structure. The more complex the structure, the greater shall be the number of vrttis. The more-developed animals, therefore, possess more vrttis than the less-developed ones. 

Generally, there are 1,000 vrttis in the human structure. 

In their development and expression on the ordinary crude level, they are 50 in number. 

The collective number being one thousand, the seeds of all those thousand vrttis are present in the brain. 

Because of the existence of these seeds of one thousand vrttis in the pineal gland, the yogins have named it sahasrára cakra [sahasra means “thousand”]. The subsidiary glands control forty-eight vrttis and the pituitary controls two – saḿkalpátmaka, or one leading to parávidyá (knowledge of the Great) and vikalpátmaka, relating to aparávidyá (knowledge of the mundane). 

The pineal as a structure controls all these 50 vrttis taken internally and externally by all 10 indriyas. 50 x 2 x 10 = 1000. 

Yogis having control over the sahasrára cakra attain nirvikalpa samádhi, a state where they are beyond the approach of all the vrttis. 

Within the scope of these vrttis lies the seed of saḿskára – good or bad. So the attainment of such a state means the end of all the saḿskára, exhaustion of all the previous momentum accumulated by the mind due to its previous journeys in Brahma Cakra. 

This is what is called mokśa – union with the Transcendentality.
