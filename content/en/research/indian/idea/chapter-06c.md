Brahma Cakra (the collective name of saiṋcara and pratisaiṋcara) has no uniformity of flow.

- the sentient force is faster than the mutative
- the mutative force is faster than the static. 

Thus, in the beginning of saiṋcara the speed is greater. 

Similarly, after elevation, under the influence of the sentient force or reaching sámánya deha (a stage beyond the hirańmaya kośa where the unit mind experiences only the sentient force), the speed is faster. 

The speed of the unit mind far exceeds the normal flow in the Cosmos. It gets accelerated if the unit mind, as a result of spiritual practice, tends itself towards the Nucleus Consciousness.

Since the beginning of creation, humans have been aspiring for this merger with the Nucleus Consciousness.

The non-uniformity of speed changes the movement of the unit mind to an elliptical force. The motion changes to oval from circular.

They get merged in Puruśottama who aspire for Him as the ultimate destiny. But those who aim at mokśa, where sádhaná is the complete surrender of self into That (Nirguńa Brahma, the Objectless Consciousness), get out of this Brahma Cakra by a tangential touch.

At this point of tangential touch is the abode of Táraka Brahma (who resides within the scope of both Nirguńa and Saguńa Brahma). 

Táraka Brahma is a concept of Tantra.

In Tantra, the whole creation is known as sambhúti. 

When Táraka Brahma by His own will takes the help of the 5 layers, <!-- (the paiṋcabhútas), --> His physical entity comes within the scope of Saguńa Brahma. Otherwise He is Nirguńa Brahma*. 


> *Superphysics note: Taraka Brahma becomes real if the person wants to rush to the Nucleus. Unlike an avatar who is the God in physical form, Taraka Brahma is Nothing temporarily becoming a unit Something to speed up the journey to Nothing.  


When Táraka Brahma takes the assistance of the 5 layers, <!-- according to Tantra --> it is called His Mahásambhúti.

In Tantra sádhaná<!--  or in Ananda Marga sádhaná -->:
- one who aims at Puruśottama merges in Saguńa Brahma
- one who aims at Nirguńa Brahma becomes surrendered into the Objectless Entity Nirguna. 

Only Tantra has the sádhaná of Táraka Brahma which:
- has its own peculiarity
- is <!--  has been specially defined --> distinct from the sádhaná of Nirguńa and Saguńa. 

Theoretically, Saguńa Brahma has infinite saḿskáras. So for an infinite time to come, Saguńa Brahma will continue to enjoy the fruit of Its own past actions. 

Nirguńa is the Objectless Entity with no action or derivation. But Táraka Brahma is the middle point and can fulfil the function of both. He guides, loves and favours His affectionate sons and daughters.

His children say that He cannot live without loving them and address Him:

{{< q >}}
“O our great Father, our affectionate Mother, our All, we remember Thee, we adore Thee. O Witnessing Entity, we offer our homage to Thee, Thou art the only rescue in this crude worldly ocean, so to Thee we surrender ourselves.” 
{{< /q >}}

This complete surrender is the summum bonum of all spiritual sádhaná, which only can lead to Him from where decline is not even imaginable. 

Really blessed is one who has attained this complete surrender unto Him, like the piece of salt which went to measure the depth of the ocean. 
- A momentous divine jerk and an attraction occurred
- The bit of salt was lost, no one knows where.

**Táraka Brahma is not a figure of philosophy. It is a creation of devotional sentiment.**
