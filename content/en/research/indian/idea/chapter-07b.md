Every stage results from the previous stages. The stage after formation of the unit mind is also the effect of all the past stages. 

"Saḿskára" is the effect of action in the past stages. It gives momentum to the unit mind. 

The initial creation of the unit mind is the result of certain forces reacting in saiṋcara. 

The ultimate cause of momentum of every force is the Macrocosm. <!-- , the entire working principle in saiṋcara and pratisaiṋcara. It is, --> Therefore, the Macrocosm:
- works through the media of microcosms
- provides the momentum for the unit mind. 

The attraction of the Great gives an acceleration to such momentum. 

At the nucleus point where the first manifestation of Prakrti took place, the momentum of creation lay in latent form. The momentum of the universe is the momentum by the Cosmos through the media of microcosms and also through the medium of the inanimate portion of the Macrocosm. 

This is the play of One in many forms. Before the formation of microcosms only the Macrocosm existed, and all projected activities lay in the Macrocosm, and all the diversities were in collective unity there. 

All the Cosmos resides in Him. Therefore, there is no question of life, death or saḿskára in this inanimate phase of creation (from the first bursting out of Prakrti, to the development of crudest solid matter).

In the journey of pratisaiṋcara, the crude mind gets momentum from the Macrocosm. 

In the first stage, the microcosm evolves neither ego (ahaḿtattva) nor mahattattva, so it is devoid of any saḿskára. The eternal force of the Macrocosm moves the microcosms further towards the Nucleus.

In a later stage, the ego is evolved but the unit mind feels it and accepts it as a possessor of saḿskára or momentum. Afterwards, a stage comes when this ego starts controlling the mental activities.

This stage in evolution is represented by human beings. Humans instead of going further towards the divine goal according to the movement of pratisaiṋcara can retrace, or adopt the path of negative pratisaiṋcara. 

The momentum for this negative movement being the accepted momentum of the unit mind, it is said that the saḿskára of any living animal inferior to the human is “infused” but that of the human is “acquired”.

Inferior animals continue to march on the path of pratisaiṋcara (because of their less-developed ego), while humans may retrace by adopting mean objectives.

While maintaining the unit structure of any object in the animated phase of evolution, proper adjustment amongst mental waves, physical waves and the práńáh is an essentiality. 

Any object, mental or physical, always emanates waves. If these waves from the physical body and the mental body have a parallelism, then and then only is a cooperative unit structure maintained.

This parallelism can be lost as well, causing a dissociation of the composite factors by a maladjustment or unadjustable elevation or degradation of any one of the constituent factors. 

In the animated phase of evolution elevation occurs due to physical clash, psychic clash, or the attraction of the Supreme. 

To take an example, if a dog comes in contact with a human, the mental waves of the dog contact and clash with the waves of the human and thereby the dog’s mental waves get evolved and attain a greater wavelength.

A stage may be reached when the evolved mental wavelength of the dog may lose proper adjustment with its physical structure. 

This loss in parallelism will cause dissociation, and the dissociated mind will have to find a physical body with which it can find proper adjustment. We say that the animal has “died” and undergone a corporal change.

If a psychic clash with higher thought brings about the better wavelength and thereby becomes the cause of a more evolved physical body, contact and clash with meaner thought will lessen the wavelength of the mental waves. 

Here, as well, the loss of parallelism shall occur and the physical and psychic bodies shall dissociate from each other. 

For example, if a person's mental wavelength cannot adjust properly with the human body, his psychic body will have to associate with another <!-- properly adjustable --> physical structure such as <!-- , which may be of -->:
- an inferior animal
- a plant, or
- crude matter. 

The epic Rámáyańa tells of Ahalyá, the wife of Gaotama Muni, being transformed into stone for some sin done by her. It illustrates the process of negative pratisaiṋcara. 

The imbibing of waves of higher wavelengths can rarefy the psychic body of a lower animal or plant, so that it can associate with the human physical structure. <!-- , and vice versa, if the wavelength is made cruder by inculcating meaner thoughts. -->

- Life arises from the association by proper adjustment and parallelism between the psychic and physical bodies.
- Death is the dissociation under adverse conditions. 

Such association can also take place if the waves of the physical structure get cruder due to old age or any other physical deficiency. Here the physician may come to help and by some means or other attribute to the physical body the requisite wavelength.

Through science the span of life can be made longer by properly adjusting the waves of the physical bodies.

But if a change in the mental body be made by changing the brain, its personality itself will also get changed. Such a change will mean the transformation of the person himself, and thus not Mr. X but Mr. Y shall regain life.
