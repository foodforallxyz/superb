## Mind

Saiṋcara transforms the transcendental entity <!-- Puruśa --> Consciousness into <!-- , under the localized influence of His immanent principles, is transformed into --> Mind, as the Great-Layer, Ego-Layer, and mindstuff<!--  Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva and citta -->. 

The first 2 stages of bondage are theoretical – the movement or vibration is unrestricted by the relative factors of time, space and person. These 2 stages are not perceivable. <!-- do not come within the scope of perception.  -->

But the third stage, He as mindstuff, <!--  c He, under the influence of the static principle, is converted into the objective “I” which --> comes within the jurisdiction of autoperception. 

<!-- Mind is a coordination of those 3: 
- Mahattattva
- Ahaḿtattva
- citta.  -->

In the process of pratisaiṋcara, <!-- the crudest matter, --> by division and decimation, solids get metamorphosed into subtler factors. **This creates the unit mind**. 

**The stuff of the unit mind is just the same as that of the Cosmic Mind.** 

- The Cosmic Mind is formed in the saiṋcara process under the influence of the innate tendencies. 
- The unit mind is created in the process of pratisaiṋcara under the influence of the belligerent crystals of the Macrocosm.

- In the extroversial phase, both in Macrocosm and microcosm, static Prakrti predominates.
- In the introversial phase, the sentient principle predominates 

In both phases, all 3 principles exist. 

Even in Nirguńa Brahma, or the Unsubjectivated Transcendental Entity, these principles continue to  <!-- do not cease to --> exist. It is the stage of pará shánti (absolute peace) because there the 3 principles are balanced. 

Hence in Nirguńa Brahma, there is no humming up of waves, no clash within or without. 

Prakrti, the omni-active entity, lies quiet. The transcendental sublimity remains unpolluted. 

In Tantra, this latent Prakrti is known as Anucchúnyá Prakrti. 

This Anucchúnyá Prakrti is the causal stage of the 3 expressed principles. It is purely abstract. 

When the Anucchúnyá gets disturbed, the 3 fundamental principles start functioning. This expresses their svabháva (characteristics), leading to Saguńa Brahma, or the Subjectivated Transcendentality, getting stirred in Its impersonal exhibition.

Saguńa Brahma is exhibited through the activities or the activating potentialities of the 3 expressions of Ucchúnyá Prakrti. 

These 3 expressions are the fundamental creative principles or guńa in Sanskrit:

1. Sattva (sentient)
2. Rajah (mutative)
3. Tamah (static). 

<!-- They are known as . These names have been allotted according to their respective functions, and the diversities of the created world depend upon the comparative domination of one over the other two.  -->

In both the saiṋcara and pratisaiṋcara processes<!-- , that is, in the entire survey of the Macrocosm, --> the Supreme Entity appears to lose its transcendentality because of these 3 gunas.

Activation of any force signifies a change in position of the body on which said force is applied. 

Hence during the creation of mind certainly a localized change takes place within the infinite space of the Transcendental Entity. The Cosmic Mind, though big, is therefore limited. and as such its localized characteristics debar it from becoming absolute.

Mind cannot maintain its existence without objectivity. 

During its course of creation, mind automatically gets an objectivity in the form of the done ego or static “I”. 

Thus, the fundamental mental objectivity is a projected objectivity. 

- “Macrocosm” or the “Cosmic Mind” is the mind where the projected objectivity presents itself in a collectivated form, maintaining closest alliance with the projector.
  - It can get itself metamorphosed into many by mere vibration of its thought-waves
  - To the Macrocosm, the projected objectivity (or objectivities) is neither diverse nor external.
- “Microcosm” or “unit mind” is where this projected objectivity (or objectivities) appears to be independent of other diversities and detached from the projecting apparatus. 
  - Its imagination cannot produce any actuality in the physical world.
  - To the microcosm, the projected objectivity appears:
    - as diversities and beyond the scope of its existence.
    - as original actualities of the physical strata.

<!-- One more vital difference between Macrocosm and microcosm lies in their capacities of thought power.  -->

In case of hypnotism or ghost-affectedness, the mental image of the unit mind gets projected and appears to be a fact. But actually it has no physical existence. 

In the physical world, whatever the microcosm creates with the help of its physical structures is nothing but a chemical or physical transformation of the 5 fundamental factors created as actualities by the Macrocosm in the saiṋcara process.


## The Senses or Práńendriya

During the mental process of extrovert and introvert, there is always a clash within the physical body due to the external pressure of static Prakrti. 

Práńa or energy results from the unifying <!-- interial --> and<!--  exterial --> divisive forces working within the physical structure.

Energy (Váyu) is a bhútatattva and a fundamental factor formed due to crudification of ether

The 10 energies (váyus) are made up of 5 unifying:

1. práńa
2. apána
3. samána
4. udána
5. vyána

and 5 dividing:

6. nága
7. kúrma
8. krkara
9. devadatta
10. dhanaiṋjaya


The cooperative activity of these 10 is known as práńáh*.

> *Superphysics note: Práńa is just energy. Práńáh is the energy that maintains the structure.


The sense and motor organs (indriyas) are actually in the brain and not on the external surface of the physical body, which are merely the gateways. These gateways receive the quantum-perceptions <!-- There are gateways of the indriyas on the external surface of the physical body receiving tanmátras --> emanated from objects.

These perceptions <!-- tanmátras received through these gateways --> are converted into psychic objects according to the inherent saḿskáras of the individuals.
