In the cycle of social evolution, during each age before it is succeeded by another age, one particular class enjoys domination and superiority. 

Such a class, while in political power, has every chance of exploiting the society. History has shown that this is not mere chance, but has been repeating itself. Now the duty of the sadvipra is to see that the dominating class does not take recourse to exploitation. 

The four classes are:
1. Shúdra, the toiling class
2. Kśatriya, the warrior class
3. Vipra, the intellectual class
4. Vaeshya, the capitalist class

These have remained well defined in the cycle of human civilization. The gradual domination and decline of each class shall continue<!--  to occur in this cycle -->.

Life is a dynamic principle. The movement of the samája cakra continues without any break or pause.

The cycle cannot be checked, as stagnation implies death. 

The job of a sadvipra is to see that the dominating or the ruling classes do not have any scope for exploitation. 

The moment one class turn into exploiters, the life of the majority becomes miserable: a few enjoy at the cost of many whose lot is only to suffer. 

More than that, in such a state of society both the few and the many get degenerated. The few (exploiters) degenerate themselves due to [an] excess of physical enjoyments and the many (exploited) cannot elevate themselves, because all their energy is taken up in mundane problems and all their mental waves are always tending to attain psycho-physical parallelism, thus getting day by day cruder. 

Hence, for the physical, mental and spiritual welfare of the administrator and the administered of the society as a whole, it is essential that no one be given any scope to exploit the rest of the society.

Sadvipras are not inactive witnesses. They are active participants to see that no person or class exploits the rest. 

For this, they may have to resort even to physical violence. This is because the sadvipras will have to strike at the source of the power which is tending to become the exploiter.

If the kśatriya class are becoming exploiters, the sadvipras may have to resort to physical force. 

If the intellectual or vipra class are dominating, they will have to create a revolution in the intellectual field. 

If the vaeshyas are dominating, the sadvipras may have to contest and win elections. This is because the vaeshya class rules by democracy which enables them to accumulate undue gains.
