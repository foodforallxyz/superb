How does life get expression within the physical unit structure?

Physical structures are composed of 5 fundamental layers<!--  factors -->:

1. Ethereal
2. Aerial
3. Luminous
4. Liquid
5. Solid

A unit structure has a body made up of a composite of these 5 layers<!--  factors --> with controlling nuclei.

These layers <!-- factors --> should remain in requisite proportion. 

Vital energy or práńáh is the structure's collective creative unifying energy. 
- It <!-- resultant interial --><!--  or  --> depends on the mutual cohesion of these layers<!-- factors -->.
- The controlling nucleus of all these fundamental physical nuclei is the controlling point of this collective vital energy.

<!-- This collection of práńa is called pranah. -->


> *Superphysics Note: <!-- Práńa is just energy. --> Práńáh is the living energy that maintains the structure. It comes from the unifying force. This is the opposite of physical energy which comes from the divisive force (i.e. a fire will dissociate a unified piece of wood into diverse ashes, while a tree will unify diverse minerals in the soil into a single wooden entity).  



**A deficiency of some layer results in the wear and tear within a physical structure.**
<!-- and may also tell upon the resultant activity controlling the subjective nucleus and maintaining structural solidarity.  -->
- If the deficiency is not adequately compensated, and if the requisite proportion of any layer <!-- factor or factors --> is not met, the vital energy (creative unifying force) <!-- resultant interial --> will begin varying in intensity. 
- The unit structure may lose its solidarity. 

<!-- Logically, therefore, it may be concluded that for the physical unit structure  -->

**An environment for the unit structure is essentially required where all these 5 fundamental layers are available in requisite quantity.** 
- **Life can get expression only under such a condition.** 
<!-- For the manifestation of life, therefore, a congenial atmosphere is a fundamental necessity. --> 
- Hence, life is the expression of the creative unifying force of itself as vital energy under a congenial environment.

<!-- práńáh or -->   <!-- resultant interial -->

In Sanskrit, this vital energy is always plural because it is a collection of 10 important forces (váyus) working internally or externally of the physical structure.

The manifestation of vital energy <!-- práńáh --> depends on 2 conditions:

1. The <!-- resultant of práńa must be an interial force --> <!-- creation of práńa must be a --> energy must be from the unifying force
2. There must be a congenial environment

A lack of a congenial condition in the present-day world has caused giant animals of the past to either:
- become smaller or
- vanish altogether.

Even if the creative unifying force <!-- resultant interial be --> <!-- the winning factor --> wins against energy<!-- in the  práńa -->, the physical structure will split up into <!-- innumerable --> subtler particles if the atmospheric condition is not congenial to the expression of the vital energy. 

**In the absence of a proper environment, life does not get an expression.** 



## Structural Dissociation from the Lack of Vital Energy

Structural Dissociation (jad́asphot́a) happens when celestial bodies lose vital energy. This can be:
- instantaneous
- gradual


Instantaneous structural dissociation happens when static Activity <!-- Prakrti --> continues exerting static pressure<!--  or bala --> on a lifeless unit structure. 
- This compresses the solid body until it creates a tremendous reaction within the physical body affecting both the unifying and divisive forces. 
- In Physics, this is called a supernova.

<!-- Unable to express life, the  becomes more compressed. Eventually, this creates --> <!-- Consequently, a stage will come when there will be little interatomic space within . If static Prakrti exerts more pressure, there will be -->  <!-- interial and the exterial --> <!-- forces. This leads to an instantaneous structural dissociation (jad́asphot́a). -->  <!-- "" -->.

In a living celestial body, the existing congenial environment will convert energy into vital energy. <!--  cause transformation of práńa into práńáh. --> 
- This eliminates the chance of dissociation.


Gradual structural dissociation happens when a living celestial body has divisive energy <!-- práńa --> permeating some of its spaces. 


<!-- dissociation occurs gradually in some spaces of the structure, then the bursting up becomes gradual. -->

Both instantaneous and gradual dissociation converts the celestial body back into the component 5 fundamental layers.
<!-- Due to jad́asphot́a, gradual or , the component factors of the physical structure get dissociated into the  factors.  -->


## Reverse-Crudification (Negative Saincara)

Reverse-Crudification <!-- Negative saiṋcara --> is the retracing back in Crudification<!-- saiṋcara -->. 

In this process, the component layers <!-- factors --> cannot dissociate subtler than the ethereal, as that would mean the Ego-Layer withdrawing its active thought-projection. 
- This withdrawal would mean suspension of the Cosmic Mind or the cessation of Macrocosmic activity or the end of creation.<!-- , as creation itself is only a thought-projection of the Macrocosm.  -->

Dissociation is not an end of thought.
- It is a <!-- Bursting up is not a phenomenon of withdrawal, but a --> stirring up of the thought-waves due to excessive pressure of static Activity<!-- Prakrti -->.

The dissociation creates new identities as the 5 fundamental factors.

In this way, the journey of evolution continues eternally according to the divine urge of the Macrocosm. There is no chance of the thermal death of the universe.
