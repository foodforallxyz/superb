Let us see how life gets expression within the physical unit structure. These physical structures are composed of five fundamental factors – ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid – and so, for their own existence as unit structures, they must have the controlling nuclei of the respective factors within their composite body. All these factors should remain in requisite proportion, and on the mutual cohesion amongst these factors depends the resultant interial, or the práńáh. The controlling nucleus of all these fundamental physical nuclei is the controlling point of the collective práńa. This collection of práńa is called práńáh or “vital energy”.

The wear and tear within a physical structure results in the deficiency of some factor or other and may also tell upon the resultant activity controlling the subjective nucleus and maintaining structural solidarity. Now if the deficiency caused thereby is not adequately compensated, and if the requisite proportion of any factor or factors is not met, the resultant interial will begin varying in intensity; and the unit structure may lose its solidarity. Logically, therefore, it may be concluded that for the physical unit structure an environment is essentially required where all these five fundamental factors are available in requisite quantity. Life can get expression only under such a condition. For the manifestation of life, therefore, a congenial atmosphere is a fundamental necessity. Hence it may be concluded that the resultant interial force expressing itself into life under a congenial environment is what is known as práńáh or vital energy. In Sanskrit this term is always used in the plural number, because it is a collection of ten váyus, or ten important forces, working within or without the physical structure.

The manifestation of práńáh depends on 2 essential conditions:

1. The resultant of práńa must be an interial force
2. There must be a congenial environment

A lack of a congenial condition in the present-day world has caused giant animals of the  past to either:
- become smaller or
- vanish altogether.

Even if the resultant interial be the winning factor in práńa, the physical structure will split up into innumerable subtler particles if the atmospherical condition be not congenial to the expression of the vital energy. 

**In the absence of a proper environment, life does not get an expression.** 

But static Prakrti continues exerting external pressure or bala on the unit structure. 

Consequently a stage will come when there will be little interatomic space within the solid body. If static Prakrti exerts more pressure, there will be a tremendous reaction within the physical body (affecting both the interial and the exterial forces) resulting in structural dissociation. This is called jad́asphot́a.

Jad́asphot́a occurs only in dead or dying celestial bodies. 

In a living celestial body, the existing congenial environment will cause transformation of práńa into práńáh. This eliminates the chance of jad́asphot́a.

These jad́asphot́as can be instantaneous or gradual. 

Conditions for its instantaneous occurrence have been described above. 

But if, due to exterial forces of práńa, dissociation occurs gradually in some portions of the structure, the phenomena of bursting up become gradual.

Due to jad́asphot́a, gradual or instantaneous, the component factors of the physical structure get dissociated into the five fundamental factors. 


## Negative Saincara

Negative saiṋcara is the retracing back in saiṋcara. In this process, the component factors cannot dissociate into factors subtler than the ethereal, as that would mean the Ahaḿtattva withdrawing its eternally active thought-projection. 

This withdrawal by the Cosmic “I” would mean suspension of the Cosmic Mind or cessation of Macrocosmic activity or the end of creation, as creation itself is only a thought-projection of the Macrocosm. 

Bursting up is not a phenomenon of withdrawal, but a stirring up of the thought-waves due to excessive pressure of static Prakrti. 

The dissociation creates new identities as the five fundamental factors – solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal.

In this way, the journey of evolution continues eternally according to the divine urge of the Macrocosm. 
And there is no chance of the so-called thermal death of the universe.
