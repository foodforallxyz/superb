ow life gets expression within the physical unit structure. 

Physical structures are composed of 5 fundamental factors:

1. Ethereal
2. Aerial
3. Luminous
4. Liquid
5. Solid

A unit structure has a body made up of a composite of these 5 factors with controlling nuclei.

These factors should remain in requisite proportion. The structure's creative unifying force <!-- resultant interial --> or práńáh depends on the mutual cohesion of these factors. 

The controlling nucleus of all these fundamental physical nuclei is the controlling point of the collective práńa. This collection of práńa is called práńáh or “vital energy”.

The wear and tear within a physical structure results in the deficiency of some factor. 

<!-- and may also tell upon the resultant activity controlling the subjective nucleus and maintaining structural solidarity.  -->

If the deficiency is not adequately compensated, and if the requisite proportion of any factor or factors is not met, the creative unifying force <!-- resultant interial --> will begin varying in intensity. The unit structure may lose its solidarity. 

<!-- Logically, therefore, it may be concluded that for the physical unit structure  -->

An environment for the unit structure is essentially required where all these 5 fundamental factors are available in requisite quantity. 

Life can get expression only under such a condition. 

<!-- For the manifestation of life, therefore, a congenial atmosphere is a fundamental necessity. --> 

Hence, práńáh or vital energy is the <!-- resultant interial --> creative unifying force expressing itself as life under a congenial environment. 

In Sanskrit this vital energy is always plural because it is a collection of 10 important forces (váyus) working internally or externally of the physical structure.

The manifestation of práńáh depends on 2 essential conditions:

1. The <!-- resultant of práńa must be an interial force --> creation of práńa must be a unifying force
2. There must be a congenial environment

A lack of a congenial condition in the present-day world has caused giant animals of the past to either:
- become smaller or
- vanish altogether.

Even if the creative unifier <!-- resultant interial be --> <!-- the winning factor --> wins in práńa, the physical structure will split up into <!-- innumerable --> subtler particles if the atmospheric condition is not congenial to the expression of the vital energy. 

**In the absence of a proper environment, life does not get an expression.** 

But static Prakrti continues exerting external pressure or bala on the unit structure. 

Consequently, a stage will come when there will be little interatomic space within the solid body. If static Prakrti exerts more pressure, there will be a tremendous reaction within the physical body affecting both the unifying and divisive <!-- interial and the exterial --> forces. This will result in structural dissociation called jad́asphot́a.

Jad́asphot́a occurs only in dead or dying celestial bodies. 

In a living celestial body, the existing congenial environment will cause transformation of práńa into práńáh. This eliminates the chance of jad́asphot́a.

These jad́asphot́as can be instantaneous or gradual. 

Conditions for its instantaneous occurrence have been described above. 

But if, due to<!--  exterial --> divisive forces of práńa, dissociation occurs gradually in some spaces of the structure, then the bursting up becomes gradual.

Due to jad́asphot́a, gradual or instantaneous, the component factors of the physical structure get dissociated into the 5 fundamental factors. 


## Negative Saincara

Negative saiṋcara is the retracing back in saiṋcara. 

In this process, the component factors cannot dissociate into factors subtler than the ethereal, as that would mean the Ahaḿtattva withdrawing its eternally active thought-projection.

This withdrawal by the Cosmic “I” would mean suspension of the Cosmic Mind or the cessation of Macrocosmic activity or the end of creation, as creation itself is only a thought-projection of the Macrocosm. 

Bursting up is not a phenomenon of withdrawal, but a stirring up of the thought-waves due to excessive pressure of static Prakrti.

The dissociation creates new identities as the 5 fundamental factors.

In this way, the journey of evolution continues eternally according to the divine urge of the Macrocosm and there is no chance of the thermal death of the universe.
