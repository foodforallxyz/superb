Consciousness is the supreme subjectivity. 

All other, mundane, subjectivities or objectivities are mere blendings of the absolute subjectivity.

Therefore, the mind is not an absolute entity. Instead, it is a transformed state of consciousness. 

To perform its actions, it depends on the motor or sensory organs as its direct agents. Afferent and efferent nerves, in their turn, act as direct agents of these organs.

The nerves:
- convey the tanmátras from objects into the mind
- activate the objects with the force they get from the mental structure

Thus, they link the mind with the external objectivities and are the indirect agents of the mind.

Whenever the outgoing tanmátras carrying mental force get reflected, the objects come within our scope of sensation, perception and conception. 

When they get refracted, the objects partially come within our scope of sensation, etc. 

When the quantum-perceptions are neither reflected nor refracted or when there is little reflection or refraction, the objects do not come within the scope of our feeling.

The correctness of perception depends upon a good many factors. The objects transmitting tanmátras must be in healthy condition. The gateways of the organs must be healthy, and also the reflecting tanmátras should be defectless. 

The afferent and efferent nerves and the mindstuff should be sufficiently strong and active. The last but not least factor is that the ego should be ready to receive them. 

Any defect or slackness of any of the above factors results in incorrect perception and hence in incorrect conception.

For example, in glaucoma, watery fluid is deposited in the optical nerve. This causes a dispersion of light inside, making <!--  As a result even --> the white light transmitted by objects appear to be spectrum-colored.

So far as the efferent nerves are concerned, it is primarily upon the activating capacity of the ego that the process of physical activity depends. 

One’s personality also depends on the activating (radiating) capacity. The more developed is the radiating power, the more glaring will be one’s personality.

Thus, the mind acts through the organs and nerves to receive or radiate the tanmátras. 

The portion of mind which deals with indriyas is named kámamaya kośa. This controls the physical longings of the microcosm.

As regards the Macrocosm the mind is said to be started at that stage where the sense of subjectivity (Mahattattva), the subjectivated “I” (Ahaḿtattva) and the objectivated “I” (citta) are all present. 

Hence, in the stage of citta we get Mahattattva and Ahaḿtattva as well.

In the extroversial saiṋcara process citta gradually crudifies under the influence of static Prakrti, till the crude solid is created. 

This process of crudification of mindstuff, having a coordination of Great-layer and Ego-layer, is divided into 5 stages<!--  known as kośas -->. 

According to their relative density of crudeness developed through the bondage of the static principle, the five kośas, starting from the initial stage, are:
- hirańmaya kośa
  - this is called “causal” or “astral” mind collectively with the vijiṋánamaya and atimánasa kosas 
- vijiṋánamaya kośa
- atimánasa kośa
- manomaya kośa
  - this is known as the “subtle mind” or súkśma manah
- kámamaya kośa. 
  - this is the crudest in structure and is called the “crude mind” or sthúla manah in dealing with the 5 layers.
<!--   -  and in the case of the microcosm dealing with the external paiṋcabhútas,   -->

The <!-- psychological nomenclature of --> Freudian classification of “conscious”, “sub-conscious” and “unconscious” minds for the crude, subtle and causal minds are wrong.


## Kámamaya Kośa

This is the crudest stage of citta, where it is metamorphosed into the crudest stuff. 

With the five manifested fundamental physical factors (it is physical for the microcosm but mental for the Macrocosm) the Macrocosmic Mind displays its will. 

Macrocosmic control over the five fundamental physical factors means the internal display of the Macrocosmic kámamaya kośa. 

Nothing is beyond the scope of Cosmic Mind. Everything comes within that mental scope. And so the Macrocosmic Entity needs no nervous system or senses for controlling these operations. The Cosmic Mind at this stage requires no physical structure.


## Manomaya Kośa

The manomaya kośa is subtler than the kámamaya kośa. It has the capacity of recollection and contemplation (smarańa and manana). 

From the microcosmic angle of vision, the kámamaya kośa of the Macrocosm is expressed through the 5 rudimental physical factors from which the physical body of the microcosm and other physical objects come into being. 

The kámamaya kośa of the Cosmic includes, therefore, the annamaya kośa of the unit. 

Here, the Macrocosm in its flow of imagination creates actualities for the unit mind, whereas the kámamaya kośa of the unit cannot create physical actualities by its imagination. 

The kámamaya kośa, having the function of dealing with the bhútas, is said to be the crude mind in the case of the microcosm also. The manomaya, performing the function of recollection and contemplation, is known as the subtle mind of the microcosm also. 



## Atimánasa, Vijiṋánamaya, Hirańmaya

These are the causal portion of both the Macrocosm and the microcosm. 

<!-- The remaining 3 kośas are still more subtle and also being the rudimental stages of sthúla and súkśma manah, are .  -->

But the division of the microcosm into a causal portion is merely theoretical. 

There is no separate existence of the unit causal mind from the Cosmic causal mind. 

In case the crude and subtle portions of the unit mind suspend their work by the process of sádhaná or otherwise, the causal portion of the unit mind will not be able to maintain its separate identity. Only the seed of past action will remain just to differentiate the microcosm from the Macrocosm.

Through correct sádhaná, the sádhaka will feel that there is one causal mind in the universe.

There is no causal difference between the microcosm and the Macrocosm. 

Similarly, by the subtleness of projection, subtle and crude portions of the unit mind can connect themselves with the subtle and crude portions of the Cosmic Mind. 

Yogic sádhaná is the way to achieve this subtleness of projection.

The entire Macrocosm can similarly be divided into 3 parts:
- crude
- subtle
- astral or causal. 

The physical world is within the psychic scope of the Macrocosm, the Macrocosm cannot have any crude or physical body in the sense the microcosm has. 

Yet because of the inclusion of the five bhútas within its mind, the kámamaya kośa of the Macrocosm is often termed the crude body of Paramátman.

The remaining portions of the Macrocosmic kośas are:
- the subtle body, or the súkśma deha, of Paramátman. 
- Ahaḿtattva and Mahattattva of Paramátman are known as Its astral or causal body.

The concept of “causal body” is only philosophical. This is because philosophy says that the moment the Macrocosmic Nucleus<!--  Puruśottama --> was influenced by His immanent sentient principle:
- the seed of creation was expressed
- His bodies and lokas were created.

Similarly, the annamaya kośa of the unit is its crude body (sthúla deha). 

The kámamaya, the manomaya, atimánasa, vijiṋánamaya and hirańmaya kośas constitute the subtle body of the unit. 

Above the scope of hirańmaya and till the merger into Puruśottama the unit certainly possesses a body but that body cannot be termed causal. It, being the last phase, is known as sámánya deha.

By its very nature, if the mind is to possess objectivity, it must also have a witnessing entity. 

The witnessing entity is the summum bonum of the mind. 

Philosophy has given different names to the witnessing entity according to the differences in the nature of the objective mind. 

But this does not mean that the same Macrocosmic Nucleus <!-- Puruśottama --> is not the witnessing entity at different stages of the mind.

It is He who reflects Himself as the witnessing counterpart by functional difference due to the changing mental status. 

At different stages, different names have been adopted for that singular entity:

Name of Macrocosmic Nucleus | Stage of Cosmic Mind
--- | ---
Virát́a or Vaeshvánara | causal Cosmic mind
Hirańyagarbha | subtle Cosmic mind
Iishvara | crude Cosmic mind


Similarly, the Macrocosmic Nucleus has different names as witness of the microcosm:

Name of Macrocosmic Nucleus | Stage of Cosmic Mind
--- | ---
Vishva | causal Cosmic mind
Taejasa | subtle Cosmic mind
Prájiṋa | crude Cosmic mind


The Cosmic Entity extends in different <!-- lokas --> worlds wherein the different stages <!-- kośas --> and the unit minds dwell. 

The term loka refers only to the Macrocosm and not to the unit. 

The kámamaya stage of the Cosmic where material structure has taken form is called the “physical world"<!-- bhurloka -->. 

The kámamaya stage of the Cosmic Entity where material structure has just begun taking form but has not actually acquired it is called <!-- bhuvarloka or --> “crude mental world”. 

The levels of manomaya, atimánasa, vijiṋánamaya and hirańmaya stages are known as svarloka or “subtle mental world”, maharloka or “supramental world”, janarloka or “subliminal world” and taparloka, respectively.

Above that, since the causal body is conceived to be in existence from a philosophic point of view, it is termed Satyaloka.

<!-- The above kośas, different stages of mind, witnessing entities and lokas are tabulated below. -->
