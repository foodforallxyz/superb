<!-- ## Paramátman and Atman -->

"Paramátman" [active collective consciousness] is the collective name for the Macrocosmic Nucleus.<!--  Puruśottama -->.

<!-- The resultant force of Prakrti bursts out from one of the vertices of the triangle of forces of Prakrti, and that this is the origin of creation. 

The mid-point of this triangle of forces from whose vertex the bursting occurred is Puruśottama. 

The mid-points of these triangles of forces having bursting vertices coincide, and hence Puruśottama is a singular entity. -->

<!-- Philosophers have defined  -->

<!-- , His prota yoga in saiṋcara and ota and prota yogas in pratisaiṋcara.  -->
- It means “conscious of creations”. 
- It is the consciousness in the Nucleus and the consciousness in the Macrocosm and microcosms.

**Macrocosm (Cosmic Mind) and microcosms (unit mind) themselves are not included in Paramátman.** 

"Saguńa Brahma" is the collectivity of Paramátman, Macrocosm and microcosms. It is the Brahma in which Prakrti appears in manifestation. In Saguńa Brahma, Puruśottama is the Nucleus Consciousness and so the latter is also named Kút́astha. 

The Nucleus Consciousness or the Átman in the unit structure is also called kút́astha caetanya.

Its controlling station is the ajna chakra <!-- middle point between the eyebrows, the place --> where the functioning of the pituitary gland is located.

<!-- Saiṋcara is movement away from the Nucleus – the Nucleus itself being the centre of Brahma Cakra, or the great cycle of creation. The force of saiṋcara is, therefore, centrifugal. Philosophy refers to this outward movement as domination by Avidyámáyá or illusion of ignorance. Under the effect of Avidyámáyá creation moves from the subtle to the gross, finally reaching the farthest point in saiṋcara where the crudest solid or kśititattva is formed – where the metamorphosed form of the citta possesses the maximum chemical affinity, with no possibility of any further reduction in the intermolecular and interatomic spaces. -->

In the farthest point in saiṋcara, the unit structure of the  crudest solid factor <!-- Depending on conditions,  --> either:
- bursts at this point or jad́asphot́a occurs, or
- the mind is formed by a process of division and association of matter. 

**The formation of mind is the start of pratisaiṋcara.** 

This progress is effected by the domination of Vidyámáyá or illusion of knowledge, whereby the direction of motion is towards the Nucleus Puruśottama, the centre of all creations. 

Every step in this direction is a step nearer the centre, the destined goal of all, the ultimate result of all creations. 

This force is centripetal and is associated with the growing attraction of Puruśottama. 

This attraction is His blessing by which He leads every being of His towards the kindly divine light. 

The associated reflection of Puruśottama increases the proximity of the unit mind to Puruśottama. The mind proportionately expands and progresses till the gradual expansion brings about similarity of the microcosm and the Macrocosm and the former gets merged into the latter. 

<!-- This process occurs in pratisaiṋcara under the centripetal force of attraction from the Nucleus Consciousness, Puruśottama. -->

The unit mind, however, can accelerate the speed of this motion by realizing His blessing more and more and thereby acquiring a psycho-spiritual parallelism with greater speed. 

'Sádhaná' is the attempt to:
- accelerate the motion of pratisaiṋcara, the movement towards the ultimate goal. 
- cover up the painful hours of divine separation as early as possible

Only human beings possess the ego to perform this sádhaná. 

The touchstone of spiritual sádhaná is therefore the feeling that “I am tending towards Him.”

**Every delayed moment of life is only a moment of pain.** That alone which brings His realization is His spiritual practice, all other actions being ritualistic ostentations.

Consciousness in the psycho-physical unit structures gets manifested in the process of pratisaiṋcara when Puruśottama by His ota yoga associatively reflects on the unit psychic plate. 

It is through this process, pratisaiṋcara, that the Ever-Merciful elevates each creation of His by the force of Vidyámáyá. 

The physical and psychic clash and the attraction of the Great cause psychic dilation, and ultimately the unit psychic body can attain its final liberation or mukti by its spiritual sádhaná. 

Different unit minds exist at different levels and experience varying degrees of His love and proximity depending upon their progress in the process of pratisaiṋcara. 

The auspicious day of infinite ánanda descends, and all the bondages of Prakrti shatter down, when Brahmatva is attained.

Such individuals set the ideal for humanity. In turn, humanity starts paying homage to them. 

Only such elevated beings can and should be called Mahápuruśa, meaning thereby elevated psychic beings. 

Unto their holy feet, one can offer the flowers of devotion and aspiration, but they desire no crude earthly flowers and offerings.

The advent of Mahápuruśa is misinterpreted as incarnation. Incarnation is an illogical hypothesis. 

The whole universe being created out of Him and by Him is His incarnation. 

"Avatára" means a “derivation”, from "ava" and "tr", meaning “descend”, “derive” or “degenerate”. 

It is wrong to call to individual minds who are far advanced in the process of pratisaiṋcara as avatars. 

It is illogical to consider that the Macrocosm metamorphosed Himself directly into some unit structure, in most cases a human being. 

Human beings are the most evolved individual units as a class in His creation. Every stage of the elevated psychic Mahápuruśa is the result of saiṋcara and then pratisaiṋcara. 

**It is a gradual elevation and not an abrupt descent or occurrence.**

Logically, any unit consciousness is an incarnation of God. <!--  or to say that the Messenger of God traverses the path of saiṋcara, goes through a process of evolution and importance, and through psychic dilation in the process of pratisaiṋcara reaches different stages of elevation. --> 

Avatáraváda is the incarnation theory. It hypothesizes that:
- the avatar is the direct descent of the Almighty and is Puruśottama
- the rest of His creation has unexplained <!--  as to its --> source of origin.

<!-- The incarnated being, according to this dogma of degeneration of Puruśottama, cannot have an equal status with Puruśottama.  -->

When the psychic status of a created being assumes sameness with the Cosmic Entity, the unit psychic entity actually merges into the Cosmic Mind leaving no dualism.

Hence how can Puruśottama be equal with <!-- imagined existing as --> any separate entity in any stage within Brahma Cakra? 

<!-- The whole theory of incarnation or avatáraváda is, therefore, not convincing and rational for an intellectual analysis. -->

Behind the superstitious belief of avatáraváda lies one more social current created by a class of vested interests. 

Inquisitiveness and reasoning is a natural impulse in human beings. Due to certain pressing circumstances or intellectual renaissance there was a reaction against the illogical faiths and superstitions prevalent in society. 

These superstitions provided a strong basis for exploitation of society by intellectual parasites who had learnt to live on the blood and labour of others. 

To maintain their domination through a system of superstitious belief, these parasites invented means to curb this growth of reaction and intellectual rationalism and presented to the mass a sentimental appeal. 

Any command, rational or irrational, was enforced on society with so-called divine force by enunciation of the incarnation theory. 

Corruption was perpetrated in the name of God, and all those raising their heads against such commands or preachings were called reactionaries, atheists, and curbed drastically. “Give the dog a bad name and hang it,” was their motto.

They went to the extent of manipulating, polluting and misinterpreting even the precious writings of many great philosophers whose work had been respected as religious treatises from ancient times – all with an ulterior motive, to get their interests served.
