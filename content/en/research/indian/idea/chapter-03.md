## Bhútatattva (Created Layers)

Saiṋcara is a process of analysis, transforming one into many. 

Avidyámáyá is the operative force behind its multicreative characteristics. At different phases of this saiṋcara, bhútas or creation-layers with their peculiar properties come into existence.

Bhúta means “created being”. Generally, it refers to the past. 

Through the influence of the sentient force on Puruśottama, Mahattattva comes into being. It turns into Ahaḿtattva by the activation of the mutative force. <!--  this Mahattattva is metamorphosed into ;  -->

Prakrti then converts a part of the subjectivated “I” into the objectivated “I” or done “I” or citta of the Cosmic Entity. 


The "Cosmic Mind" is the combination of Mahattattva, Ahaḿtattva and citta. 

The stages of transformation of Cosmic Consciousness prior to the exhibition of Cosmic citta are not objective realities. This is why <!--  in the strict sense of the term, and as such --> the existence of the Cosmic Mind cannot be established unless<!--  and until --> its psychic projection is logically dealt with.

Even after the formation of citta, static Prakrti goes on influencing the Cosmic citta more and more. It causes further crudification or decrease in the intermolecular and interatomic spaces and gradual increase in the chemical affinity.


## Aethereal

In the first phase of this crudification, the chemical affinity permits the transmission of sound waves only. 

**Hence, ákásha (the ethereal body) is formed when the citta, getting a bit cruder, is able to carry sound waves.**

This ákásha is the first rudimental factor on the physical level.


## Aerial

The continued influence of static Prakrti increases the chemical affinity. This decreases the intermolecular and interatomic spaces, making the factor or bhúta cruder than ákásha. 

It enables the second factor, as the aerial factor or váyutattva, to carry the wave or sensation of touch over and above the extant capacity of transmitting sound waves.


## Luminous

The ever-increasing influence of static Prakrti creates an internal clash in the váyubhúta giving rise to sparks of light. This slowly converts the váyubhúta into a luminous factor or tejastattva. 

The sense of vision or radiation of rúpatanmátra is the special property of this luminous factor.

With the continued action of the static principle, the liquid body and finally solid structures are formed. The liquid entity is perceptible by the additional sense of taste (or flow) and the solid body by the further addition of the sense of smell.

The above formations are gradual, not abrupt. The intermediate stage between citta and ether is neither an abstract nor matter. 

Similarly, the sun is at an intermediate stage between the aerial and the luminous factors.

The earth in its infancy was neither luminous nor liquid. 

Gradually, it was converted into a liquid body. Slowly, the outer surface was turned into solid. In its inner body, the earth is still in liquid form. In the more interior portion, the luminous and gaseous factors are being slowly converted into liquid.

Each and every bhúta is accessible to a certain sense of conceptions or perceptions, by which the sensory organs recognize or classify it. 

Various combinations of these bhútatattvas result in the physical creation, first of the inanimate, and later of the animated structures. The very start of the animated stage is the beginning of the process of pratisaiṋcara.

The crudest solid is the final stage of saiṋcara.

The energy or práńa working therein slowly gets converted into práńáh, vital energy. This vital energy is the direct cause of life. It thus controls the activities of the animated physical structure. 

Hereafter, the circle of pratisaiṋcara starts functioning with the coordinated cooperation of the práńáh and mind. But in the absence of a congenial environment for the práńáh to get expressed, as in the case of dead or dying celestial bodies, the physical structure will explode due to ever-increasing internal pressure. 

This explosion is called jad́asphot́a. Dissociated component factors (dissociated as a result of jad́asphot́a) get mingled up with their respective tattvas.

This process of jad́asphot́a, as a result of which the crudest factor, solid, gets converted into certain subtler factors, may be termed “negative saiṋcara”. 

The ethereal factor is the subtlest physical factor.

The solid factor can never, as a result of negative saiṋcara or jad́asphot́a, be transformed into something subtler than the ether. If it were so converted into the next subtler factor which is citta, then it would mean that the Macrocosm withdrew its thought-waves.

Thus, the bhútas are not any new stuff but only the crudified forms of Cosmic citta. These manifest at different stages of the saiṋcara process when due to the external pressure of static Prakrti:
- the intermolecular and interatomic spaces decrease
- chemical affinity increases.

Tanmátratattva: Tat + mátra = tanmátra. 

In Sanskrit, tat means “that”, mátra means “minutest quantity”. Hence "tanmátra" denotes a microscopic fraction of “that” (of “that bhúta”).

Tanmatra is a quantum-perception of that layer.
