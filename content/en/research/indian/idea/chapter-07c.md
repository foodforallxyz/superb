For the existence of life:
- <!--  or for association, --> proper adjustment between the waves of the psychic body and of the physical body is essential
- adjustment with the vital-energy <!-- práńáh --> is necessary.

Práńáh is the collective name of 10 váyus, five internal and five external. The internal váyus are práńa, apána, samána, udána and vyána; and the external váyus are nága, kúrma, krkara, devadatta and dhanaiṋjaya.

The jurisdiction of práńa is between the navel point and the vocal cord, and its function is inhalation and exhalation. Apána resides from the páyu (anus) to the navel point. Its function is to control the movement of urine and stool. 

Samána resides in the navel sphere and its function is to maintain adjustment between práńa and apána. Udána has its place in the throat, and it controls the vocal cord and the voice. Vyána regulates blood circulation and physical function of the afferent and efferent nerves.

The function of the external váyus is as follows: Nága (meaning “serpent”) gives the power to jump or to extend the body and also to throw an object. Kúrma (meaning “tortoise”) gives the function of contraction. Krkara helps in yawning. Devadatta is responsible for thirst and hunger, and dhanaiṋjaya causes sleep and drowsiness (tandrá).

A physical deficiency or defect in any portion of the body results in the weakening of práńa and apána, and samána may become unable to maintain adjustment between práńa and apána, as a result of which there takes place a vehement fight in the navel area and in the vocal cord. In physiology, this is called “navel breathing” or nábhishvása. When samána loses its vitality, all the three váyus – práńa, apána and samána – are transformed into one and strike udána. 

The moment udána loses its separate identity, vyána also comes in contact with their collective force and all the internal váyus, getting associated into one, move throughout the physical body with great force and strike at every delicate point for an outlet. The combined váyus pass out, and with their passing away from the physical structure all the external váyus, except dhanaiṋjaya, also leave the physical structure. 

Dhanaiṋjaya causes sleep, and so to cause the deep sleep of death dhanaiṋjaya remains in the body even after all the váyus have left. 

When the dead body is burnt or gets totally decayed, dhanaiṋjaya as well leaves the body and remains in the Cosmos to act again according to the will of Prakrti.

The loss in the parallelism of physical and mental waves causes death. 

The physical cause of death is the passing away of the 9 vayus (10 minus dhanaiṋjaya) into eternal space. 

The psychic waves, finding no proper adjustment with the physical waves, also dissociate and pass into eternal space. 

This detached mental body possesses the unexpressed momentum of its previous lives (which it had to express according to the universal law of Prakrti that every force must have its expression). 

**It is the duty of the Cosmic mutative force to provide it a proper physical parallelism for due expression by making the dissociated mind penetrate into a subtle physical structure.** 

 
Since the mind exists, the mental plate exists, and the reflection of Puruśottama must remain. 

The Átman, therefore, remains associated with the jiivátman. 

The ultimate knowership, doership and base of existence lie in the átman. 

The átman is the witnessing entity without which there is no meaning of the mind working or activating the internal saḿskáras into tanmátras. 

Without the átman the mind cannot perceive or receive the incoming tanmátras. This is why the ultimate knowership or doership lies in the átman. 

The átman witnesses the mind itself. The ultimate residence of the mind is the átman. 

The dissociated mind has, therefore, the witnessing entity who witnesses the mind which is in a state of inaction (or converted into karmáshaya – saḿskára, or reaction in its potentiality).

<!-- The physical cause of death has been discussed above. Let us now see the physical cause of life. -->
