<!-- ## 6. The reliance of sedentary people on laws destroys their fortitude and power of resistance -->

This is because not everyone is master of his own affairs. Their leaders are few. 

As a rule, man must by necessity be dominated by someone else. 

Self-reliance eventually becomes a natural quality to the people if :
- their leaders are kind and just
- the people are not oppressed by their laws and restrictions
- the people are guided by the courage or cowardice in themselves. 

They become satisfied with the absence of any restraining power. 

If, however, the domination with its laws is one of brute force and intimidation, it breaks their fortitude and deprives them of their power of resistance as a result of the inertness that develops in the souls of the oppressed, as we shall explain.

Umar forbade Sa'd (b. Abi Waqqas) to exercise such arbitrary power when Zuhrah b. Hawiyah took the spoils of al-Jalinus. 
- The value of the spoils was 75,000 gold pieces. 

Zuhrah had followed al-Jalinus on the day of al-Qadisiyah, killed him, and taken his spoils. 

Sa'd took them away from him and said:

"Why did you not wait for my permission to follow him?" 

He wrote to 'Umar and asked 'Umar for permission (to confiscate the spoils). 

But 'Umar replied, "Would you want to proceed against a man like Zuhrah, who already has borne so much of the brunt (of battle), 27 and while there still remains so much of the war for you (to finish)? Would you want to break his strength and morale?" 

Thus, Umar confirmed (Zuhrah) in possession of the spoils. 28 

When laws are enforced by means of punishment, they completely destroy fortitude, because the use of punishment against someone who cannot defend himself generates in that person a feeling of humiliation that, no doubt, must break his fortitude.
When laws are (intended to serve the purposes of) education and instruction and are applied from childhood on, they have to some degree the same effect, because people then grow up in fear and docility and consequently do not rely on their own fortitude.

This is why greater fortitude is found among the savage Arab Bedouins than among people who are subject to laws. Furthermore, those who rely on laws and are dominated by them from the very beginning of their education and instruction in the crafts, sciences, and religious matters, are thereby deprived of much of their own fortitude. 

They can scarcely defend themselves at all against hostile acts. This is the case with students, whose occupation it is to study and to learn from teachers and religious leaders, and who constantly apply themselves to instruction and education in very dignified gatherings. 

This situation and the fact that it destroys the power of resistance and fortitude must be understood. It is no argument against the (statement just made) that the men around Muhammad observed the religious laws, and yet did not experience any diminution of their fortitude, but possessed the greatest possible fortitude. When the Muslims got their religion from the Lawgiver (Muhammad), the restraining influence came from themselves, as a result of the encouragement and discouragement he gave them in the Qur'an. 

It was not a result of technical instruction or scientific education. (The laws) were the laws and precepts of the religion, which they received orally and which their firmly rooted (belief in) the truth of the articles of
faith caused them to observe. 

Their fortitude remained unabated, and it was not corroded by education or authority. 'Umar said, "Those who are not educated
(disciplined) by the religious law are not educated (disciplined) by God." 30 

(This statement expresses) 'Umar's desire that everyone should have his restraining influence in himself. It also expresses his certainty that the Lawgiver (Muhammad) knew best what is good for mankind.

(The influence of) religion, then, decreased among men, and they came to use restraining laws. The religious law became a branch of learning and a craft to be acquired through instruction and education. People turned to sedentary life and assumed the character trait of submissiveness to law. This led to a decrease in their fortitude.

Thus, governmental and educational laws destroy fortitude because their restraining influence is something that comes from outside. 

The religious laws, on the other hand, do not destroy fortitude, because their restraining influence is something inherent. Therefore, governmental and educational laws influence sedentary people, in that they weaken their souls and diminish their stamina, because they have to suffer (their authority) both as children and as adults. The Bedouins, on the other hand, are not in the same position, because they live far away from the laws of government, instruction, and education.

Therefore, Abu Muhammad b. Abi Zayd,31 in his book on the laws governing teachers and students (Ahkam al-mu'allimin wa-lmuta'allimin), said= "The educator must not strike a boy more than three times (in one punishment) as an educational measure." 32 

Ibn Abi Zayd reported this remark on the authority of Judge Shurayh. 33 

Certain scholar(s) argued in favor of the procedure mentioned, by referring to the threefold choking mentioned in the tradition concerned with the beginning of revelation. 34 This, however, is a weak argument. (The tradition about the) choking is not suitable proof, because it has nothing to do with ordinary instruction. God "is wise and knowing." 35


## 7. Only tribes held together by group feeling can live in the desert.

God put good and evil into the nature of man.  Thus, He said in the Qur'an= "We led him along the two paths." 36 He further said= "And inspired (the soul) with its wickedness as well as its fear of God." 37 

Evil is the quality that is closest to man when he fails to improve his customs and (when) religion is not used as the model to improve, him. The great mass of mankind is in that condition, with the exception of those to whom God gives success. 

Evil 38 qualities in man are injustice and mutual aggression. He who casts
his eye upon the property of his brother will lay his hand upon it to take it, unless
there is a restraining influence to hold him back. The poet thus said:

"Injustice is a human characteristic."

If you find a moral man, 39 there is some reason why he is not unjust. Mutual aggression of people in towns and cities is averted by the authorities and the government, which hold back the masses under their control from attacks and aggression upon each other. 

They are thus prevented by the influence of force and governmental authority from mutual injustice, save such injustice as comes
from the ruler himself.

Aggression against a city from outside may be averted by walls, in the event of negligence, 40 a surprise attack at night, or inability (of the inhabitants) to withstand the enemy during the day. (Or,) it may be averted with the help of a militia of government auxiliary troops, if (the inhabitants are otherwise) prepared and ready to offer resistance.

The restraining influence among Bedouin tribes comes from their shaykhs  and leaders. It results from the great respect and veneration they generally enjoy among the people. The hamlets of the Bedouins are defended against outside enemies by a tribal militia composed of noble youths of the tribe who are known for their courage. 

Their defense and protection are successful only if they are a closely-knit group 42 of common descent. This strengthens their
stamina and makes them feared, since everybody's affection for his family and his group is more important (than anything else). 

Compassion and affection for one's blood relations and relatives exist in human nature as something God put into the hearts of men. It makes for mutual support and aid, and increases the fear felt by the enemy.

This may be exemplified by the story in the Qur'an about Joseph's brothers.

They said to their father= "If the wolf eats him, while we are a group, then, indeed, we have lost out." 43 This means that one cannot imagine any hostile act being undertaken against anyone who has his group feeling to support him.

Those who have no one of their own lineage (to care for) rarely feel affection for their fellows. If danger is in the air on the day of battle, such a one slinks away and seeks to save himself, because he is afraid of being left without
support 44 and dreads (that prospect). Such people, therefore, cannot live in the desert, because they would fall prey to any nation that might want to swallow themup.

If this is true with regard to the place where one lives, which is in constant need of defense and military protection, it is equally true with regard to every other human activity, such as prophecy, the establishment of royal authority, or
propaganda (for a cause). 

Nothing can be achieved in these matters without fighting for it, since man has the natural urge to offer resistance. And for fighting one cannot do without group feeling, as we mentioned at the beginning. This should be taken as the guiding principle of our later exposition. 


## 8. Group feeling results only from (blood) relation ship or something corresponding to it

Respect for blood ties is something natural among men, with the rarest exceptions. It leads to affection for one's relations and blood relatives. One feels shame when one's relatives are treated unjustly or attacked, and one wishes to intervene between them and whatever peril or destruction threatens them. 

This is a natural urge in humans. If the direct relationship between persons who help each other is very close, so that it leads to close contact and unity, the ties are obvious and clearly require the (existence of a feeling of solidarity) without any outside (prodding). 

If, however, the relationship is somewhat distant, it is often forgotten in part. However, some knowledge of it remains and this causes a person to help his relatives for the known motive, in order to escape the shame he would feel in his soul were a person to whom he is somehow related treated unjustly46

Clients and allies belong in the same category. The affection everybody has for his clients and allies results from the feeling of shame that comes to a person when one of his neighbors, relatives, or a blood relation in any degree (of kinship) is humiliated. 

The reason for it is that a client(-master) relationship leads to close contact exactly, or approximately in the same way, as does common descent. It is in that sense that one must understand Muhammad's remark, "Learn as much of your
pedigrees as is necessary to establish your ties of blood relationship." 47 

It means that pedigreesare useful only in so far as they imply the close contact that is a consequence of blood ties and that eventually leads to mutual help and affection. Anything beyond that is superfluous. 48 

For a pedigree is something imaginary and devoid of reality. It is useful only in the resulting connection and close contact. Common descent evokes in man a natural affection. 

If, however, its existence is known only from remote history, it moves the imagination but faintly. Its usefulness is gone, and
preoccupation with it becomes gratuitous, a kind of game, and as such is not permissible. In this sense, one must understand the remark, "Genealogy is something that is of no use to know and that it does no harm not to know." 50 

This means that when common descent is no longer clear and has become a matter of scientific knowledge, it can no longer move the imagination and is denied the affection caused by group feeling. It has become useless.
