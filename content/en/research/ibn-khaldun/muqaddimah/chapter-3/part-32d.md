### The ministry (diwan) of (official) correspondence and writing 

This office is not required by the nature of royal authority. Many dynasties were able to dispense with it completely, such as the dynasties rooted in the desert<!-- and which were not affected by the refinements of sedentary culture and high development of the crafts -->.

In the Muslim dynasty, the Arabic language situation and the custom of expressing what one wanted to express in good form intensified the need for the office. 

Thus, writing came to convey, as a rule, the essence of a matter in better stylistic form than was possible in oral expression. The secretary to an (Arab) amir was customarily a relative and one of the great of his tribe. This was the case with the caliphs and leading personalities among the men around Muhammad in Syria and the 'Iraq, because of the great reliability and genuine discretion (of relatives and tribesmen).

When the language became corrupt and a craft (that had to be learned), 498 the office was entrusted to those who knew (Arabic) well. Under the 'Abbasids, it was a high office. The secretary issued documents freely, and signed his own name to them at the end. He sealed them with the seal of the ruler, which was a signet upon which the name of the ruler or his emblem was engraved. 

It was impressed on a red clay mixed with water and called sealing clay. The document was folded and
glued, and then both sides was sealed with (the seal). Later on, the documents were
issued in the name of the ruler, and the secretary (merely) affixed his signature
('alamah) 499 to them at the beginning or end. He could choose where he wanted to
put it as well as its wording.

The office then lost standing through the fact that officials of other government ranks gained in the ruler's esteem or because the wazir gained control over (the ruler). The signature of a secretary became ineffective (as a sign of authority) and was replaced by the signature of his superior, and this was now considered decisive. (The secretary) affixed his official signature, but the signature of his superior made the document valid. 

This happened in the later (years) of the Hafsid dynasty, when the office of doorkeeper (hajib) gained in esteem and the doorkeeper became the delegate of the ruler and then came to control him. The signature of the secretary became ineffective (as a sign of authority) but was still affixed to documents, in acknowledgment of its former importance. The doorkeeper (hajib) made it the rule for the secretary to sign letters of his by affixing a handwritten (note) for which he 500 could choose any formula of ratification he wished. The secretary obeyed him and affixed the usual mark. So long as the ruler was in control of his own affairs, he saw to the matter himself (and made it the rule
for the secretary) to affix the signature.


### The Tawqi

One of the functions of the secretary's office is the tawqi. 

It means that the secretary sits in front of the ruler during his public audiences and notes down
(yuwaqqi'), in the most concise and stylistically most perfect manner, the decisions he receives from the ruler concerning the petitions presented to him. These decisions are then issued as they are, or they are copied in a document which must be in the possession of the petitioner. 

The person who formulates a tawqi' needs agreat deal of stylistic skill, so that the tawqi' has the correct form. Ja'far b. Yahya used to write tawqi's on petitions for arRashid and to hand the petition (with the tawqi') back to the petitioner. Stylists vied with each other to obtain his tawqi's, in order to learn the different devices and kinds of good style from them. 

Such petitions with Ja'far's tawqi' on them were sold for a dinar. 501

The person in charge of this function must be selected from among the upper classes and be a refined gentleman of great knowledge and with a good deal of stylistic ability. 

He will have to concern himself with the principal branches of scholarship, because such things may come up in the gatherings and audiences of the ruler. In addition, to be a companion of kings calls
for good manners and the possession of good qualities of character. And he must
know all the secrets of good style, to be able to write letters and find the words that
conform to the meaning intended.

In some dynasties, the rank of secretary is entrusted to military men, since some dynasties, by their very nature, have no regard for scholarship, on account of the simplicity of group feeling (prevailing in them). The ruler gives his government offices and ranks to men who share in his group feeling. 

Appointments to the financial administration, to "the sword," and to the office of secretary, are made from among them. "The sword" requires no learning. But the financial administration and the secretaryship need it, for the latter requires a good style and the former requires accounting skill. Therefore, (rulers) select people from the (learned) class for the office of secretary, when there is need for it, and entrust it to them. 

However, the secretary is subordinate to the higher authority exercised by the men who share in the ruler's group feeling, and his authority derives from that of his superior. This is the case with the Turkish dynasty in the East at this time. 

The office of chief secretary belongs to the "secretary of state" (Sahib al-insha').

However, the secretary of state is under the control of an amir from among the men who share in the group feeling of the ruler. This man is known as the Dawidar. 502

The ruler usually relies upon him, trusts him, and confides in him, whereas he relies upon the (secretary) for matters that have to do with good style and the conformity (of the expression) to what one wants to express, 503 and other, related matters.

The ruler who picks a secretary from the rank and file has many conditions to consider. These are  completely presented in the Epistle that the secretary Abd-al-Hamid addressed to his fellow secretaries= 504


{{< box >}}
<!-- <p>May God guard you who practice the craft of secretaryship, and may He keep you and give you success and guidance. There are prophets and messengers and highly honored kings. After them come different kinds of men, all of them made by God. They are of different kinds, even if they are all alike in fact.  -->

God occupied men with different kinds of crafts and businesses, so that they can make a living and earn their sustenance. 

He gave to you, assembled secretaries, the great opportunity to be men of education and gentlemen, to have knowledge and (good) judgment. 505 You bring out whatever is good in the caliphate and straighten out its affairs. Through your advice, God improves the government for the benefit of human beings and makes their countries civilized. The ruler cannot dispense with you.

You alone make him a competent ruler. Your position with regard to rulers is that (you are) the ears through which they hear, the eyesthrough which they see, the tongues through which they speak, and the hands through which they touch. May God give you, therefore,  enjoyment of the excellent craft with which He has distinguished you, and may He not deprive you of the great favors that He has shown unto you.

No craftsman needs more than you to combine all praiseworthy good traits and all memorable and highly regarded excellent qualities, O secretaries, if you aspire to fit the description given of you in this letter. The secretary needs on his own account, and his master, who trusts him with his important affairs, expects him, to be mild where mildness is needed, to be understanding where judgment is needed, to be enterprising where enterprise is needed, to be hesitant where
hesitation is needed. He must prefer modesty, justice, and fairness. He must keep secrets. He must be faithful in difficult circumstances. He must know (beforehand) about the calamities that may come. He must be able to put things in their proper places and misfortunes into their proper categories. 

He must have studied every branch of learning and know it well, and if he does not know it well, he must at least have acquired an adequate amount of it. By virtue of his natural intelligence, good education, and outstanding experience, he must know what is going to happen to him before it happens, and he must know the result of his actions before action starts. He must make the proper preparations for everything, and he must set up everything in its proper, customary form.

Therefore, assembled secretaries, vie with each other to acquire the different kinds of education and to gain an understanding of religious matters. Start with knowledge of the Book of God and religious duties. Then, study the Arabic language, as that will give you a cultivated form of speech. Then, learn to write well, as that will be an ornament to your letters. Transmit poetry and acquaint yourselves with the rare expressions and ideas that poems contain.

Acquaint yourselves also with both Arab and nonArab political events, and with the tales of (both groups) and the biographies describing them, as that will be helpful to you in your endeavors. Do
not neglect to study accounting, for it is the mainstay of the land tax register. 506

Detest prejudices with all your heart, lofty ones as well as low ones, and all idle and contemptible things, for they bring humility and are the ruin of secretaryship. Do not let your craft be a low one. Guard against backbiting and calumny and the actions of stupid people. Beware of haughtiness, foolishness, and pride, for they mean acquiring hostility without (even the excuse of) hatred. Love each other in God in your craft. Advise your colleagues to practice it in a way befitting your virtuous, fair, and gifted predecessors.

If times go hard for one of you, be kind to him and console him, until everything be well with him again. Should old age make one of you unable to get around and pursue his livelihood and meet his friends, visit him and honor him and consult him, and profit from his outstanding experience and mature knowledge. 

Every one of you should be more concerned for his assistants, who may be useful when needed, than for his own children or brothers. Should some praise come (to one of you) in the course of his work, he should ascribe the merit to his colleague;

any blame he should bear all by himself. He should beware of mistakes and slips and of being annoyed when conditions change. For you, assembled secretaries, are more prompt to be blamed than Qur'an readers, 507 and blame is more detrimental to you than to them. You know that everyone of you has a master, one who gives from his own as much as can be expected, and (every one of you) has the obligation to repay him, since he deserves it, with fidelity, gratefulness, tolerance, patience, good counsel, discretion, and active interest in his affairs, and to show (his good
intentions) by his actions whenever his master needs him and his resources. 

Be conscious of (your obligations) - God give you success - in good and bad circumstances, in privation as in munificence and kindness, in happiness as in misfortune. Any member of this noble craft who has all these qualities has good qualities.

If any one of you be appointed to an office, or if some matter that concerns God's children be turned over to one of you, he should think of God and choose obedience to Him. He should be kind to the weak and fair to those who have been wronged. 

All creatures are God's children. He loves most those who are kindest to His children. Furthermore, he should judge with justice, he should honor the noble (descendants of Muhammad), augment the booty (gained in wars against infidels), and bring civilization to the country. He should be friendly to the subjects, and refrain from harming them. He should be humble and mild in his office. He should be kind in handling the land tax registers 5 08 and in calling in outstanding claims. 

You should explore the character of him with whom you associate. When his
good and bad sides are known, you will be able to help him to do the good things
that agree with him, and be able to contrive to keep him from the bad things he
desires. You must be able to do that in the subtlest and best manner. You know that
a person who is in charge of an animal and understands his job, endeavors to know
the character of the animal. If it is inclined to gallop, 509 he does not goad it when he
is riding it. If it is inclined to kick, he takes precautions with its forelegs. If he fears
that it will shy, he takes precautions with its head. If it is restive, he gently subdues
its desire to go where it wants to go. If it still continues, he pulls it slightly to the
side, then has its halter loosened. This description of how to take care of an animal
contains good points for those who want to lead human beings and deal with them,
serve them, and have intimate contact with them. 

The secretary, with his excellent education, his noble craft, his subtlety, his frequent dealings with people who confer
with him and discuss things with him and learn from him or fear his severity, needs
to be kind to his associates, 509a to flatter them, and to supply their wants, even more
than the person in charge of an animal which cannot answer, does not know what is
right, does not understand what is said to it, and goes only where its master who
rides upon it makes it go. Be kind - God show mercy unto you-when you look after
things. Use as much reflection and thought as possible. God permitting, you will
thus escape harshness, annoyance, and rudeness on the part of your associates. They
will be in agreement with you, and you will have their friendship and protection.

None of you should have too sumptuous an office or go beyond the proper limits in his dress, his mount, his food, his drink, his house, his servants, or in the other things pertaining to his station, for, despite the nobility of the craft by which God has distinguished you, you are servants who are not permitted to fall short in their service. You are caretakers whom one does not permit to be wasteful or spendthrift. 

Try to preserve your modesty by planned moderation in all the things I
have mentioned and told you. Beware of the wastefulness of prodigality and the bad
results of luxury. They engender poverty and bring about humiliation. People who
(are prodigal and live in luxury) are put to shame, especially if they be secretaries
and men of education.

Things repeat themselves. One thing contains the clue to another. Let yourselves be guided in your future undertakings- by your previous experience. 

Then, choose the method of doing things that is most definite, most accurate, and that promises the best result. You should know that there is something that defeats accomplishment, namely, talking about things. The person who does it is prevented
from using his knowledge and his ability to think. 

Therefore, everyone of you, whilehe is in his office, should endeavor to talk no more than is sufficient; he should be concise in the matters he brings up and in the answers he gives; and he should give thought to all the arguments he advances. His work will profit from that. It will prevent too much preoccupation with other things. He should implore God to grant
him success and to support him with His guidance, for he must fear making mistakes
that might hurt his body and (cast doubt upon) his intelligence and education. When
any one of you says or thinks that the high quality and efficiency of his work is
obviously the result of his own cleverness and knowledge of how to do things, he
provokes God. 

God will let him depend upon himself alone, and then he will find that he is not adequate to his task. This is no secret to those who reflect. None of you should say that he has a better understanding of affairs, or knows better how to handle difficult matters, than other members of his craft, than those who serve together with him. Of two persons, discerning people consider him the more intelligent who throws off conceit and thinks his colleagues more
intelligent and more skillful than he. But at any rate, both parties should acknowledge the excellence of God's favors. No one should let himself be deceived by his own opinions and consider himself free from mistakes. Nor should he strive
to outdo his friends, equals, colleagues, or his family. Everybody must give praise to
God, in humility in the face of His greatness, in meekness in the face of His might,
and in fulfillment of the command to speak of God's favors. 510

In this letter of mine, let me refer to the old proverb= "He who accepts good
511 all is successful."
