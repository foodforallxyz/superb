Afterwards, royal authority flourished. The (official) councilor and assistant for tribal and group affairs and good relations (with the various tribes and groups) made his appearance. For him, the name of wazir was used. 

Bookkeeping remained in the hands of clients, Jews, and Christians. For (official) documents, a special secretary was appointed, as a precaution against possible publication of the ruler's secrets, something that would be disastrous to his role as political leader. 

This secretary was not as important as the wazir, because he was needed only for written matters, and not for matters that could be discussed orally. At that time, speech still preserved its old position and was uncorrupted. 451 Therefore, the wazirate was the highest rank throughout the Umayyad dynasty. The wazir had general supervision of all matters delegated to him 452 and in which he acted in a consultative capacity, as well as all other matters of a defensive or offensive nature. 

This also entailed the supervision of the ministry (diwan) of the army,453 the assignment of military allowances at the beginning of each month, and other matters. Then the 'Abbasid dynasty made its appearance. Royal authority flourished. The royal ranks were many and high ones. 

Back then, the caliph delegated his executive authority to the wazir.

His rank in the dynasty became conspicuous. Everyone looked toward the wazirate and submitted to him. Supervision of the bookkeeping office was entrusted to the wazir, because his function required him to distribute the military allowances. 

Thus, he had to supervise:
- the collection and distribution of money.<!-- , and the supervision of (that task) was added to his (duties). -->
- "the pen" and official correspondence in order to protect the ruler's secrets and preserve good style, since the language of the great mass had by that time become corrupt. 
  - A seal, entrusted to the wazir, was placed on the ruler's documents in order to preserve them.

Thus, the name 'wazir' came to include the functions of both "the sword" and "the pen," in addition to giving help to the ruler. In the days of ar-Rashid, Jafar b. Yahy, he was actually called "sultan". It indicated the general extent of his supervising power and control of the dynasty. 

The only governmental rank that he did not hold was the office of doorkeeper, and he did not hold it because he disdained to accept such an office.

Then the 'Abbasid dynasty entered the period when control over the caliphs 454 was exercised (by others). That control was at times in the hands of the wazir. At other times, it was in the hands of the ruler. When the wazir gained control, it was necessary for him to be appointed the caliph's delegate to comply fully with the religious laws, as mentioned before. 455 

Back then, the wazirate was divided into:

- "executive wazirate"
  - this happened when the ruler was in control of his affairs and the wazir executed his decisions
- "delegated wazirate"
  - which happened when the wazir controlled the ruler and the caliph 456 delegated all the affairs of the caliphate, leaving them to his supervision and independent judgment. 

<!-- This has caused a difference of opinion as to whether two wazirs could be appointed at the same time to the "delegated wazirate." The same difference of opinion has existed with regard to the appointment of two imams at the same time, as was mentioned before in connection with the laws governing the caliphate. 

The ruler continued to be controlled in this way. NonArab rulers seized power. The identity of the caliphate was lost. The usurpers were not interested in adopting the caliphal titles, 457 and they disdained to share the same title with the wazirs, because the wazirs were their servants.  -->

Later, Non Arab rulers seized power and changed the identity of the caliphate. 

They used the names "amir" and "sultan." Those in control of the dynasty were called amir al-umara' or sultan<!-- , in addition to the ornamental titles which the caliph used to give them, as can be seen in their surnames -->. 458 They left the name wazir to those in the caliph's private retinue. 

This happened until the end of <!-- So remained the case down to the end --> the Abbasid dynasty.

In this long period, language had become corrupt 459 It became a craft practiced by certain people. Thus, it came to occupy an inferior position, and the wazirs were too proud to bother with it. Also, the wazirs were non-Arab, and neither eloquence (nor good style) could be expected of their language.

People from other classes were chosen for (matters requiring Arabic eloquence and a good style).
It was their specialty, and it came to be something that was at the service of (and
subordinate to) the wazir.

The name amir was restricted to the men in charge of war operations and the army and related matters, although (the amir) had power over the other ranks and exercised control over everything, either as (the ruler's) delegate or through being in control (of the government). 

This remained the situation.

Very recently, the Turkish dynasty appeared in Egypt. The Turkish rulers noticed that the wazirate had lost its identity, because the amirs had been too proud to accept it and had left it to men who were inclined to hold it in the service of the secluded (and powerless) caliph. 

The wazir's authority had become secondary to that of the amir. <!-- (The wazirate) had become a subordinate, -->
<!-- ineffectual office. --> 

Consequently, the high-ranked Turkish rulers disdained to use the name of wazir. Instead, they called:
-  "deputy" (na'ib) the person in charge of legal decisions and supervision of the army. 460
- "wazir" the person in charge of tax collection.

The Umayyads in Spain at first used the name wazir in its original meaning. Later, they subdivided the functions of the wazir, each having a special wazir. 
- one to furnish an accounting of government finances [resources]
- another for official correspondence [?]
- another to take care of the needs of those who had suffered wrongs [judicial]
- another to supervise the situation of people in the border regions. [executive]

<!-- A special house was prepared for these wazirs. There, they sat upon carpets spread out for them and executed the orders of the ruler, each in the field entrusted to him.  -->

One of the wazirs was appointed liaison officer between the wazirs and the caliph. He had a higher position than the others, because he had constant contact with the ruler. His seat was higher than that of the other wazirs. He was distinguished by the title of "doorkeeper" (hajib). So it continued down to the end of the (Umayyad) dynasty. 

The function and rank of hajib took precedence over the other ranks. Eventually, the reyes de taifas came to adopt the title. The most important among them at that time was called "doorkeeper" (hajib), as we shall mention. 461

### Ubaydid-Fatimids

Then, the Shi'ah dynasty of the Ubaydid-Fatimids appeared in Ifriqiyah and al-Qayrawan. Their supporters were firmly rooted in desert life. 

Therefore, they at first neglected such functions and did not use the proper names for them. Eventually, they became a sedentary culture. The people came to follow the tradition of the the Umayyads and the Abbasids with regard to the use of titles. 

When, later on, the Almohad dynasty made its appearance, it at first neglected the matter because of its desert attitude, but eventually it, too, adopted names and titles. 

The name wazir was used in its original meaning. Later the tradition of the (Spanish) Umayyad dynasty was followed with regard to government matters and the name wazir was used for the person who guarded the ruler in his court and saw to it that embassies and visitors to the ruler used the proper forms of greeting and address, and that the requisite manners were observed in his presence.

The office of doorkeeper was considered by (the later Almohads) a much higher one. 462 It has continued to be this way down to the present time. In the Turkish dynasty in the East, the (official) who sees to it that people use the proper modes of address and greeting at court and when embassies are presented to the ruler, is called the dawadar. 463 

His office includes control of the "private secretary" (katib as-sirr) and of the postmasters (intelligence agents) who are active in the ruler's interest both far and near. Such is the condition of the Turkish dynasty at this time.


## The office of doorkeeper (hijibah) 464

In the Umayyad and 'Abbasid dynasties, the title of doorkeeper (hajib) was restricted to the person who guarded the ruler from the common people and would not give them access to him, or only in such ways, and at such times, as he determined. It was lower in rank at that time than the other functions. The wazir could intervene whenever he saw fit. 

This was the situation during the whole Abbasid period until today. In Egypt, this office is subordinate to <!-- the person in charge of the highest function there, who is called --> "deputy" (na'ib).

In the Umayyad dynasty in Spain, this office guarded the ruler from his entourage and from the common people. He was the liaison officer between the ruler and the wazirs and lower (officials). In the (Umayyad) dynasty, the office of doorkeeper was an extremely high position, as (Umayyad) history shows. Men like Ibn Hudayr 466 and others held the office of doorkeeper in (the Umayyad dynasty).

Later, when the Umayyad dynasty came under the control of others, the person in control was called doorkeeper (hajib), because the office of doorkeeper had been such a distinguished one. Al-Mansilr b. Abi 'Amir, as well as his two sons, 467 were hajibs. 

After they had openly adopted the external forms of royal authority, they were succeeded by the reyes de taifas. The latter, also, did not fail to use the title of . jib. It was considered an honor to possess it. 

The most powerful of (the reyes de taifas) used the royal style and titles, and then inevitably mentioned the titles hajib and dul l-wizaratayn (Holder of the Two Wazirates), meaning the wazirates of "the sword" and "the pen." The title of hajib referred to the office that guarded the ruler from the common people and from his entourage. Dhu l-wizaratayn referred to the fact that (the holder of the title) combined the functions of "the sword" and "the pen."

In the dynasties of the Maghrib and Ifrigiyah, no mention was made of the title of (doorkeeper), on account of their Bedouin attitude. Occasionally, but rarely, it is found in the 'Ubaydid(-Fatimid) dynasty in Egypt. That was at the time when (the 'Ubaydid-Fatimids) had become powerful and used to sedentary culture.In the Almohad dynasty which made its appearance (subsequently),
sedentary culture, which calls for the use of titles and the separation of government
functions with distinctive names, only became firmly established late (in the dynasty). 

The only rank they had at first was that of wazir, which they used for the secretary who participated with the ruler in the administration of his special (private) affairs. Men such as Ibn 'Atiyah 468 and 'Abd-as-Salam al-Kumi 469 held the position. (Such a wazir) had, in addition to his main duty, to take care of bookkeeping and all the financial business. Later on, the name of wazir was given to relatives of the (Almohad) dynasty, such as Ibn Jami' 470 and others. The name of doorkeeper (hajib) was not known at that time in the (Almohad) dynasty.

In the Hafsid dynasty of Ifriqiyah, the top position was at first in the hands of a wazir who gave advice and counsel. He was called "Shaykh of the Almohads." He had to take care of appointments and dismissals, the leadership of the army, and war operations. Bookkeeping and the ministry (diwan of tax collection) were another, separate rank. The person in charge of it was called Sahib al-ashghal (Manager of Financial Affairs) 471 He had complete charge of income and expenditures. He audited the finances, collected payments, and punished defaulters. One condition was that he be an Almohad. "The pen" was also a separate office under (the Almohads). It was only entrusted to a person with good knowledge of (official) correspondence and who could be trusted with secrets. 

Since people (of consequence in the dynasty) had no professional knowledge of writing and the proper use of their language for (official) correspondence, a particular descent was not a condition of appointment to that office.

The royal authority of the (Hafsid) ruler was very farflung, and a great number of dependents lived in his house. Therefore, he needed a steward to be in charge of his house. (That steward had the duty) properly to apportion and fix the salaries, allowances, garments, kitchen and stable expenditures, and other things. 

He was in control of the stores (in the treasuries) and had the duty of telling the tax collectors to provide for (the quantities and amounts of money) needed. He was called doorkeeper (hajib). Occasionally, the function of signing (official) documents 472 was added to his duties, if he happened to have a good knowledge of writing. 

However, that function was occasionally given to somebody else. It continued to be this way. The ruler stayed in seclusion, 473 and the doorkeeper (hajib) became the liaison officer between the people and all the officials. In the later (years) of the dynasty, the offices of "the sword" and of war operations were added to his duties. 

At this time it also became his duty to give advice and counsel. Thus, his office became the highest in rank and included all government functions. For some time after (the reign of) the twelfth ruler 474 of the (Hafsids), the government was controlled by others, and the ruler kept in seclusion. Afterwards, his grandson Sultan Abul-'Abbas, regained control of his affairs. 

He removed the vestiges of seclusion and (outside) control by abolishing the office of doorkeeper (hajib), which had been the stepping stone toward (control of the government) 475 He handled all his affairs himself without asking anyone else for help. This is the situation at the present time.
There is no trace of the title of doorkeeper (hajib) among the Zanatah dynasties in the Maghrib, of which the most important is the dynasty of the Merinids. Leadership of war operations and of the army belongs to the wazir. 

The rank of "the pen," as far as it is concerned with bookkeeping and (official) correspondence, goes to the person who knows these things well, even though it may be in the private possession of certain houses among followers of the dynasty.

Sometimes, (the office) is kept in (the same family), sometimes it is shared withothers.

They have a separate rank for the office (whose function it is to) guard the ruler's door and to protect the ruler himself from the common people. The person who holds that office is called by them mizwar, 476 that is, commandant of the elite troops (jindar) who are employed at the court of the ruler and responsible for executing his orders, enforcing the punishments he metes out, executing the severe measures he takes, and guarding the inmates of his prisons. Their chief (the mixwar) has charge of the court. He has to see to it that people behave properly in the reception hall where the common people (are received). His office is something like a minor wazirate.

The dynasty of the 'Abd-al-Wadids shows no trace of any of these titles, nor does it have separate (government) functions, because of its Bedouin character and insufficient (power). (The 'Abd-al-Wadids) occasionally use the name doorkeeper (hajib) for the person in charge of the ruler's personal household affairs, as was also the case in the Hafsid dynasty. He is given combined charge of bookkeeping and (official) documents, as also was the case among (the Hafsids). The reason for this is that (the 'Abd-al-Wadids) simply followed the tradition of the dynasty to which they had been subservient and whose propaganda they had been supporting when they
started their career.

Present-day Spaniards call the person in charge of bookkeeping and of the ruler's activities and of all the other financial matters, wakil (manager). The wazir (there) has the same duties as the wazir (usually has), but he is also in charge of (official) correspondence. The ruler (himself) puts his signature to all documents.

Thus, the Spaniards do not have a separate office of signer of documents ('alamah)
as other dynasties have.

In the Turkish dynasty in Egypt, the name of doorkeeper (hajib) is used for persons of authority (hakim) among the men who hold power, that is, the Turks. These persons have to enforce the law among the people in the town. There are numerous (hajibs). The office of (hajib) among (the Turks) is lower than that of na'ib, which has general jurisdiction over both the ruling class and the common people. The na'ib has the authority to appoint and remove certain officials at the proper times. 

He may grant and fix small salaries. His orders and decrees are executed as those of the ruler. He is the ruler's delegate in every respect. The doorkeepers (hajib), on the other hand, have jurisdiction over the various classes of common people and over the soldiers only when a complaint (against them) is lodged with them. They can use force against those who do not want to submit to their) judgment. They rank below the na'ib.

In the Turkish dynasty, the wazir is in charge of collecting all the taxes:
- land tax
- customs duties
- poll tax

He also is in charge of spending the tax revenue for government expenditures and the fixed stipends for soldiers and government employees. 

In addition, he can appoint or remove all officials, whatever their rank and description, who are concerned with tax collection and disbursement. 477 

It is a custom of (the Turks) that the wazir be appointed from among the Copts in charge of the office of bookkeeping and tax collection, because in Egypt they have been familiar with these matters since ancient times. Occasionally, the ruler appoints to that office a member of the ruling group, one of the Turkish grandees or one of their descendants, as occasion may arise.
