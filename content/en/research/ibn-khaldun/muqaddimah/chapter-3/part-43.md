At the beginning, the dynasty is remote from royal aspirations. 

It needs group feeling through which its power and domination can materialize, and the desert attitude is characteristic of group feeling.

A dynasty based upon religion is remote from royal aspirations. In one based exclusively upon superior (political) power, the desert attitude, through which superiority is achieved, likewise is remote from royal aspirations and ways.
Now, if a dynasty at the beginning of its rule is a Bedouin one, the ruler
possesses austerity and the desert attitude. He is close to the people and easily
accessible. Then, when his power is firmly established, he comes to claim all the
glory for himself. He needs to keep away from the people and to remain aloof with
his friends, in order to be able to talk with them about his special (private) affairs,
since his following has by then become large. 

Therefore, he seeks to keep away from the common people as much as possible. He employs someone at his door to
admit (only) those of his friends and of the people of the dynasty whom he cannot
avoid, and to prevent people (in general) from having access to him. (That person) is
stationed at the (ruler's) door to exercise his function.

Then, when royal authority flourishes and royal ways and aspirations make
their appearance, the ruler adopts royal character qualities. They are strange, peculiar
qualities. They must be carefully handled in the proper way by those who are in
contact with them. Persons in contact with (rulers) often do not know about these
qualities and may do something that (rulers) do not like. He may become displeased
with them and get into the mood of. punishing them. Thus, knowledge of manners to
be used in intercourse with (rulers) became the sole property of their special friends.

The rulers kept all except their intimates from meeting them at all times, so as to
protect themselves against noticing anything that might displease them and in order
to protect the people against exposing themselves to punishment. Thus, (rulers)
introduced another entrance restriction even more selective than the first. (The first)
concerns special friends of the ruler and prevents everyone else's admission. The
second restriction concerns the meetings with those friends (of the rulers), and
prevents admission of everyone else from among the common people.
The first entrance restriction is in existence at the beginning of a dynasty, as
we have said. It originated in the days of Mu'awiyah and 'Abd-al-Malik and the
Umayyad caliphs. The person in charge of entrance restrictions was called by them
"doorkeeper" (hajib), a word properly derived from the same root (as the word
"entrance restriction").

Then, the 'Abbasid dynasty made its appearance. Its famous luxury and power came into being, and the royal qualities reached their proper perfection in it. This called for the second entrance restriction. The name of "doorkeeper" (hajib)
was restricted to it. The court of the caliphs contained two buildings to house their
retinue, one for the special group and another for the common people. This is statedin 'Abbasid history.

In the later dynasties, a third entrance restriction came into being. It was even more selective than the two previous ones. This occurred at the period when the attempt was made to seclude the ruler. It resulted from the fact that the first step taken by the men of the dynasty and intimates of the ruler who set up the young
princes and attempted to gain control over them, was to keep the inner circle and the
special friends of (the young ruler's) father away from him. The person who
attempted to gain control over the young ruler suggested to him that it would
diminish respect for him and would destroy the rules of etiquette if these men were
to be in contact with him. His purpose was to keep the young ruler from meeting
anybody else and see to it that he would become so used to him that he would not
want to replace him with anybody else until he securely dominated him. An
entrance restriction such as (the third) was obviously required under these
circumstances. As a rule, it comes into existence only in the later (years) of a
dynasty, as we have mentioned before in connection with the seclusion of the
ruler. 688 It indicates the senility and decline of the dynasty. It is one of the things
that the members of dynasties are afraid of. Those who support the dynasty will
naturally attempt such a thing when the dynasty reaches senility and later-born
members of the ruling family lose control. Human beings love very much to gain
control over royal authority, 689 especially when the soil is prepared and all the
requirements and symptoms are there.


## 43. The division of one dynasty into two.

The first (perceptible) consequence of a dynasty's senility is that it splits. This is because, when royal authority comes into its own and achieves the utmost luxury and prosperity and when the ruler controls all the glory and has it all for himself, he is too proud to let anyone share in it. 

As far as possible, he eliminates all claims in this direction by destroying those of his relatives who are
possible candidates for his position and whom he suspects.
Those who participate with the ruler in this (activity) often have fears for
their own (safety) and take refuge in remote parts of the realm. People who are in
the same situation as they of running a risk 691 and becoming suspect, join them
there and gather around them. (At that time,) the authority of the dynasty has already
begun to shrink and to withdraw from the remote parts of the realm. Thus, the
refugee who is related (to the dynasty) gains control there. His power grows
continually, while the authority of the dynasty shrinks. Eventually he becomes, or
almost becomes, an equal partner in the dynasty.
This may be observed in the Arab Muslim dynasty. Its power was great and
concentrated, its authority far-flung, and the group feeling of the Banu 'Abd-Manaf
was one and supreme over all the Mudar. Therefore, no dissension made itself felt
over the whole period of (the Arab Muslim dynasty), except for the disturbances
caused by the Kharijites, who were willing to die for their heresy. That (however)
had nothing to do with royal authority and (political) leadership, and they were not
successful, because they were up against a strong group feeling. Then, the
Umayyads lost control, and the 'Abbasids took over. The Arab dynasty had, by then,
achieved the utmost superiority and luxury, and was beginning to shrink. (At that
time,) 'Abd-ar-Rahman I ad-Dakhil took refuge in Spain, the most remote region of
the Muslim dynasty. He founded a realm there and severed it from the 'Abbasid
cause. Thus, he made two dynasties out of one. Then, Idris took refuge in the
Maghrib and seceded and seized power there. His son and successor commanded the
Awrabah, the Maghilah, and the Zanitah Berbers, and took possession of both the
Maghribs (Morocco and Algeria).
Later on, the 'Abbasid dynasty shrank more and more. The Aghlabids were
stirred up to resist (the 'Abbasids). Then, the Shi'ah (the 'Ubaydid-Fatimids) seceded.
The Kutimah and the Sinhajah supported them, and they took possession of Ifriqiyah
and the Maghrib, and then conquered Egypt, Syria, and the Hijaz. They defeated the
Idrisids and divided the ('Abbasid) dynasty into two more, so that the Arab
('Abbasid) dynasty now consisted of three (independent) dynasties= the 'Abbasids at
the center and base of the Arab world and at the source of Islam; the Umayyads,
who had renewed their old royal authority and caliphate of the East in Spain; and
the 'Ubaydid(-Fatimids) in Ifriqiyah, Egypt, Syria, and the Hijaz. These dynasties
continued to exist until their destruction was imminent or complete.
In the same way, the 'Abbasid dynasty also split into other dynasties. There
were the Hamdinids and their successors, the Banu 'Uqayl, in the Jazirah and Mosul.
There were the Tulunids and their successors, the Banu Tughsh (Ikhshidids), in
Egypt and Syria. In the remote (East), there were the Siminids in Transoxania and
Khurisin, and the 'Alawids (Zaydis) among the Daylam and in Tabaristan. This,
finally, led to Daylam domination of Firs and the two 'Iraqs, including Baghdad andthe caliphs. Then, there came the Saljuqs. They took possession of all that (area).
Later on, their dynasty, too, split after having flourished, as is known from their
history.
The same thing may also be observed of the Sinhajah dynasty in the Maghrib
and Ifriqiyah. When it reached its zenith in the days of Badis b. al-Mansur, 692
Badis' uncle Hammad revolted against him and cut off the Maghrib provinces
between Mount Awras and Tlemcen and the Moulouya (Malwiyah River) and took
them for himself. He founded al-Qal'ah 693 in the Mountain of the Kutamah near
Msila (al-Masilah). He settled there and took possession of their center Ashir on
Mount Titteri. He thus founded another realm split off from that of the family of
Badis. The family of Badis remained in al-Qayrawan and environs. This remained
this way, until the power of both of them was completely destroyed.
The same was the case with the Almohad dynasty. When the shadow it cast
began to shrink, the Hafsids revolted in Ifrigiyah. They made themselves
independent there and founded their own realm for their descendants in that region.
Their power flourished and reached the limit, but then, one of their descendants, the
amir Abu Zakariya' Yahya, the son of Sultan Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, the fourth Hafsid
caliph, seceded in the western provinces and founded a new realm in Bougie and
Constantine and environs. He passed it on to his children. (Abu Zakariya' and his
children) thus split the dynasty in two. Then (his children) took possession of the
capital in Tunis. Later on the realm was again divided, among their descendants, and
then they regained full power.
The process of splitting may lead to the formation of more than two or three
dynasties that are not controlled by members of the (original) ruling family. This
was the case with the reyes de taifas in Spain and with the non-Arab rulers in the
East. It also was the case in the Sinhajah (Zirid) realm in Ifriqiyah. In the later
(years) of the Sinhajah dynasty, every castle in Ifrigiyah was in the possession of an
independent rebel, as we shall mention. 694 The same was the case with the Jarid and
the Zab in Ifriqiyah shortly before the present time, as we shall also mention. 695
This is the case with every dynasty. Inevitably, luxury, ease, and a decrease
in the extent of its power cause it to be affected by the symptoms of senility. Then,
members of the ruling family or people of the dynasty who have gained control
divide it among themselves, and numerous dynasties come into existence where
(there had been one).
God inherits the earth and whomever is upon it.
