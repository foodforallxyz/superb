### The mint 563

This is concerned with the stamping of the dinars and dirhams used in commercial transactions. This is done with a die of iron, upon which pictures or
words are engraved in reverse. The stamp is pressed upon the dinar or the dirham,
and the designs (legends) of those engravings appear on the coin clearly and
correctly. Before this is done, the standard of purity of the particular coin, the result
of repeated refinings, is taken into consideration, and the individual dinars and
dirhams are given the proper, fixed weight that has been agreed upon. Then, the
number of coins (and not their weight only) can be made use of in transactions. If
the individual pieces have not been given the weight fixed upon, then the weight of
the coins must be taken into consideration.
The word sikkah (mint) refers to the stamp, that is, the piece of iron used for
the purpose (of stamping the coins). The word was then used to designate the result
of (the application of the stamp), that is, the engravings that appear upon dinars and
dirhams. The word was further used to designate control of (the process of
engraving) and supervision of the whole operation, of everything dealing with
coinage and all the conditions that govern it. Such (control and supervision) is
(exercised by) the office (of the mint). The word has thus come to designate (that
office), and is customarily so used in governmental usage. It is an office that is
necessary to the royal authority, for it enables people to distinguish between goodand bad coins in their transactions. That (the coins) are not bad is guaranteed by the
engravings known to have been stamped upon them by the ruler.
The non-Arabs used (coins) and engraved special pictures on them, for
example, a picture of the ruler at the time of issue, a fortress,564 some animal or
product, or something else. This remained the practice of the non-Arabs down to the
end of their power. When Islam appeared, the practice was discontinued, because of
the simplicity of Islam and the Bedouin attitude of the Arabs. In their transactions,
they used gold and silver according to weight. They also had Persian dinars and
dirhams. They used them, too, according to weight and employed them as their
medium of exchange. The government paid no attention to the matter. As a result,
the frauds practiced with dinars and dirhams eventually became very serious.
According to the reports of Sa'id b. al-Musayyab and Abu z-Zinad, 565 Abd-al-
Malik ordered al-Hajjaj to coin dirhams, and bad coins (began to) be distinguished
from good ones. This took place in 74 [699/94], or, according to al-Mada'ini, 566 in
75 [694/95]. In the year 76 [695/96], ('Abd-al-Malik) ordered that dirhams be coined
in all the other regions. The legend upon them was=  "God is one, God is the samad."
56 7
Later on, in the days of Yazid b. 'Abd-al-Malik, Ibn Hubayrah became
governor of the 'Iraq and improved the mint. Then Khalid al-Qasrt, and after him
Yusuf b. 'Umar, made great efforts to improve it.
It is also said that the first to coin dinars and dirhams (in Islam) was Mus'ab
b. az-Zubayr. 568 He did it in the year 70 [689/90] in the 'Iraq, upon the order of his
brother 'Abdallah, who was then in charge in the Hijaz. The legend on his coins was,
on the one side, "blessing," and on the other (there was) the name of God. A year
later, al-Hajjaj changed the legend, and the new legend was=  "In the name of God-
al-Hajjaj." 569
The weight of the dirhams was fixed at what it had been in the days of
'Umar. At the beginning of Islam, the weight of the dirham had been six danaqs.
The weight of the mithqal was one dirham and three-sevenths of a dirham, so that
ten dirhams made seven mithqals. The reason for this was that the weight of the
dirham had varied in the days of the Persians. A dirham corresponding to the weight
of a mithqal might weigh twenty, or twelve, or ten carats. When it was necessary to
determine the weight (of the dirham) for the charity tax, the average of the three
values was taken, that is fourteen carats. Thus, the mithqal (of twenty carats) was
one dirham and three-sevenths of a dirham (of fourteen carats). It is said that the
baghli (dirham) had eight danaqs, the tabari (dirham) four, the maghribi (dirham)
three, and the yaman (dirham) one. 570 'Umar gave orders to investigate and
determine which dirham was most commonly used in transactions. It turned out to
be the baghli" and the tabari (dirhams). Together they weighed twelve danaqs.
Thus, the (weight of the) dirham was (fixed at) six danaqs. When three-sevenths of
that weight was added, it was a mithqal, and when threetenths of a mithqal were
taken away, it was a dirham.
When 'Abd-al-Malik saw fit to use the mint to protect against fraud the two
coins (the gold dinar and the silver dirham) that were current in Muslim transactions,
he determined their values as what they had been in the time of 'Umar. He used the
iron stamp, but engraved words on it, rather than pictures, because eloquent words
were obviously more congenial to the Arabs. Moreover, the religious law forbids
pictures.
After ('Abd-al-Malik), the coinage remained the same for the whole Muslim
period. Both the dinar and the dirham were round. The inscription on them waswritten in concentric circles. On one side, the legend included the names of God
with the formulas=  "There is no God but God" and "Praised be God," and the prayer
for the Prophet and his family; on the other side, it included the date and the name
of the caliph. (Coins were of) this type during the period of the 'Abbasids, the
'Ubaydid(-Fatimids), and the (Spanish) Umayyads. The Sinhajah had no mint except
at the end of their rule when al-Mansur, the master of Bougie, used one. This has
been mentioned by Ibn Hammad in his History.571
For the Almohads, al-Mahdi set the precedent of coining square dirhams and
engraving a square on the round dinar. 572 He covered one side of the coins with the
formulas=  "There is no God but God" and "Praised be God," and the other with a
legend of several lines containing his name, (which was replaced by) his successors
with their names. This became the practice of the Almohads. Their coinage has kept
that shape down to this time. It has been reported that before al-Mahdi came forth,
he was described as "master of the square dirham" by the practitioners of magic who
predicted the coming of his dynasty.
The present day inhabitants of the East have no coinage of fixed value. For
their transactions, they use dinars and dirhams by weight, and their value is
determined through standard weights corresponding to so-and-so many (dirhams, or
dinars). The mint engraves 573 on them the formula "There is no God but God" and
the prayer for the Prophet, as well as the ruler's name, as is also the practice of the
Maghribis.
"This is the decision of the Mighty, the Knowing One." 574
Note=  575 We shall conclude our discussion of the mint by explaining the
meaning of "the legal dirham" and "the legal dinar" and their value.
The dirham and the dinar differ in value and weight in different regions,
cities, and provinces. The religious law has had occasion to refer to these (coins)
and has mentioned them in connection with many laws concerning the charity tax,
marriage (fees), fixed legal fines, and other things. Therefore, the religious law must
have its own (dirham and dinar) with a specific value given to them by (the religious
law itself) and agreeing with the intention of (the religious law). These coins are
then the ones to which the laws refer. They are different from the non-legal (coins).
It should be known that since the beginning of Islam and the time of the men
around . Muhammad and the men of the second generation, the legal dirham is by
general consensus the one, ten of which are equal to seven mithqal of gold, and an
ounce of gold is forty dirhams. Thus, the legal dirham is seven-tenths of a dinar. A
gold mithqal weighs seventy-two average-sized grains of wheat. Consequently, the
dirham, which is seven-tenths of a mithqal, has a weight of fifty and two-fifths
grains. All these values are accepted by general consensus. The pre-Islamic dirham
was of several kinds. The best was the tabari, a dirham of eight danaqs, and the
baghli, a dirham of four danags. 576 For the legal dirham, they took the mean, that
is, six danaqs. The charity tax on one hundred baghli dirhams or one hundred tabari
dirhams was fixed at five such "mean" dirhams.
People do not agree, however, that (the value of legal dirhams) was
established (only) by 'Abd-al-Malik and by general consensus later on, as we have
reported and as was mentioned by al-Khattabi 577 in the Kitab Ma'alim as-sunan
and by al-Mawardi in the Kitab al-Ahkam as-sultaniyah. 578 Thorough scholars of
recent times do not think so, because it would imply that legal dirhams and dinars
were not known in the time of the man around Muhammad and subsequently, even
though legal tariffs such as the charity tax, marriage (fees), fixed legal fines, andother such things are based on them, as we have (just) mentioned. The truth is that
the value of (legal dirhams and dinars) was known at the (earliest) times (of Islam)
for the implementation of laws involving tariffs based on (legal dirhams and dinars),
but their value was not individually specified outside. It was an internal custom of
the Muslims, which had become accepted under the influence of the religious law,
and which used a fixed value and weight for (dirhams and dinars).
The Muslim dynasty thereafter became great and flourishing. Conditions
called for individual specification of the value and the weight of dirhams and dinars,
in accordance with the religious law, in order to obviate the (constant) obligation to
determine their value. This (situation) developed in the days of 'Abd-al-Malik. He
specified the individual value of (the dinar and the dirham) outside (in real money),
as it had been in theory. 579 On the coins, he engraved his name and date after the
two confessions of faith=  ("I confess there is no God but God" and "I confess that
Muhammad is the Messenger of God"). 'Abd-al-Malik withdrew the pre-Islamic
coins altogether. They were eventually purified (melted down) and (re-)engraved
with a legend, so that (in their original form) they became non-existent. This is the
inescapable truth.
Later on, officials of the mint in the various dynasties deliberately
disregarded the legal value of dinar and dirham. Their value became different in the
different regions. The people reverted to a theoretical knowledge of (the legal dinar
and dirham), as had been the case at the beginning of Islam. The inhabitants of
every region calculated the legal tariffs in their own coinage, according to the
relationship that they knew existed between the (actual) value of (dirhams and dinars
in their coinage) and the legal value.
The weight (in gold) of the dinar is seventy-two averagesized grains of
wheat. This is reported by thorough scholars and is the general consensus from
which only Ibn Hazm deviates. Ibn Hazm thought that the weight of the dinar is
eighty-four grains. This was reported as Ibn Hazm's opinion by Judge 'Abd-al-
Haqq. 580 Thorough scholars have refuted (Ibn Hazm's opinion). They considered it
an unfounded assumption or an error, and rightly so. "God causes the truth to come
true in His words." 581
It is also known that the legal ounce is not the one which is commonly used
among the people, because the commonly used (ounce) differs according to the
various regions, while the legal ounce is a theoretical unit which admits of no
differences.
