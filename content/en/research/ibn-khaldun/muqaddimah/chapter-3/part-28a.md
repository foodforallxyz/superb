<!-- It should be known that we have been discussing the imamate and mentioned
the fact that it is part of the religious law because it serves the (public) interest. (We
have stated) that its real meaning is the supervision of the interests of the Muslim nation in both their worldly and their religious affairs. 327  -->

The caliph is the guardian and trustee of the Muslims. He looks after them as long as he lives. It follows that he should also look after their (affairs) after his death, and, therefore, should appoint someone to take charge of their affairs as he had done (while alive), whom they can trust to look after them as they had trusted him then.

Such appointment of a successor) is recognized as part of the religious law through the consensus of the (Muslim) nation, (which says) that it is permissible and binding when it occurs. Thus, Abu Bakr appointed 'Umar as his successor in the presence of the men around Muhammad. They considered (this appointment) permissible and considered themselves obliged by it to render obedience to 'Umar.

Likewise, 'Umar appointed six persons, the remnant of the ten (men to whom Paradise had been guaranteed), 328 to be members of (an electoral) council (shura), and he put it up to them to make the choice for the Muslims. Each one deferred to
(the judgment) of the next man, until it was the turn of 'Abd-arRahman b. 'Awf. He applied his independent judgment and discussed the matter with the Muslims. 

He found that they agreed upon 'Uthman and 'Ali. He (himself) preferred 'Uthman as the person to receive the oath of allegiance, because ('Uthman) agreed with him concerning the obligation to follow the example of the two shaykhs (Abu Bakr and 'Umar) in every case, without making use of his independent judgment. 

Thus, 'Uthman was confirmed, and it was considered necessary to obey him. A great number of the men around Muhammad were present on the first and on the second (occasion). 329 None of them expressed the slightest disapproval. This shows that
they were agreed upon the correctness of the procedure and recognized its legality. 

It is recognized that consensus constitutes proof. No suspicion of the imam is justified in this connection, even if he appoints his father or his son his successor. He is trusted to look after the affairs of the Muslims as long as he lives. He is all the more responsible for not tolerating while he is (alive the possibility that there might arise evil) developments after his death. 

This is against those who say that (the imam) is suspect with regard to (the appointment of) his son or father, and also against those who consider him suspect with regard to (appointment of) his son only, not his father. In fact, he could hardly be suspected in this respect in any way. 

Especially if there exists some reason for (the appointment of a successor), such as desire to promote the (public) interest or fear that some harm might arise (if no successor were appointed), suspicion of the imam is out of the question.
This, for instance, was the case with Mu'awiyah's appointment of his son 330 

The action met with agreement of the people, and, therefore, is in itself an Yazid. 

argument for the problem under discussion (namely, that the imam is not suspect with regard to whomever he might appoint). But Mu'awiyah himself preferred his son Yazid to any other successor, because he was concerned with the (public)
interest of preserving unity and harmony among the people, (and realized that hecould achieve this purpose only by appointing Yazid), since the men who possessed executive authority, that is, the Umayyads, agreed at that time upon Yazid. The
Umayyads were then agreeable to no one except (Yazid). The Umayyads constituted the core (group) of the Quraysh and of all the Muslims, and possessed superiority (Mu'awiyah,) therefore, preferred (Yazid) to anyone else who might have been considered more suited for the caliphate. 

He passed over the superior person in favor of the inferior one, 331 because he desired to preserve agreement and harmony,
which is the more important thing in the opinion of the Lawgiver (Muhammad). No other motive could be expected of Mu'awiyah. His probity and the fact that he was one of the men around Muhammad preclude any other explanation. The presence of
the men around Muhammad on that occasion and their silence are the best argument against doubt in this matter. They were not persons to tolerate the slightest negligence in matters of the truth, nor was Mu'awiyah one of those who are too proud to accept the truth. 

They were all above that, and their probity precludes it. The fact that 'Abdallah b. 'Umar avoided the issue must be ascribed to his general avoidance of participation in any business, whether permissible or forbidden. He is well known for this (kind of attitude). Ibn az-Zubayr was the only one left to oppose (Mu'awiyah's) appointment, upon which the great mass had agreed. Small minorities of persons holding divergent opinions, it is well known, (are treated by jurists as not authoritative).

After Mu'awiyah, caliphs who were used to choose the truth and to act in accordance with it, acted similarly. Such caliphs included the Umayyads 'Abd-al-Malik and Sulayman and the 'Abbasids as-Saffah, al-Mansur, al-Mahdi, and ar-
Rashid, and others like them whose probity, and whose care and concern for the
Muslims are well known. They cannot be blamed because they gave preference to
their own sons and brothers, in that respect departing from the Sunnah of the first
four caliphs. Their situation was different from that of the (four) caliphs, who lived
in a time when royal authority as such did not yet exist, and the (sole) restraining
influence was religious. Thus, everybody had his restraining influence in himself.
Consequently, they appointed the person who was acceptable to Islam, and preferred
him over all others. They trusted everybody who aspired to (the caliphate) to have
his own restraining influence.

After them, from Mu'awiyah on, the group feeling (of the Arabs) approached its final goal, royal authority. The restraining influence of religion had weakened. The restraining influence of government and group was needed. If, under those circumstances, someone not acceptable to the group had been appointed as successor (to the caliphate), such an appointment would have been rejected by it. 

The (chances of the appointee) would have been quickly demolished, and the community would have been split and torn by dissension. Someone asked 'Ali= "Why do the people disagree concerning you, and why did they not disagree concerning Abu Bakr and 'Umar?" 'Ali replied= "Because Abu Bakr and 'Umar were in charge of men like me, and I today am in charge of men
like you." 331a He referred to the restraining influence of Islam.

When al-Ma'mun appointed 'Ali b. Mitsa b. Ja'far asSadiq his successor and called him ar-Rida, the 'Abbasids greatly disapproved of the action. They declared invalid the oath of allegiance that had been rendered to al-Ma'mun, and took the
oath of allegiance to his uncle Ibrahim b, al-Mahdi. There was so much trouble,
dissension, and interruption of communications, and there were so many rebels and
seceders, that the state almost collapsed, 332 Eventually, al-Ma'mlin went from
Khurasan to Baghdad and brought matters back to their former conditions.
Such (differences as the one just cited between caliphate and royal authority)must be taken into consideration in connection with (the problem of) succession.

Times differ according to differences in affairs, tribes, and group feelings, which come into being during those (times). Differences in this respect produce, differences in (public) interests, and each (public interest) has its own particular
laws. This is a kindness shown by God to His servants.

However, Islam does not consider preservation of (the ruler's) inheritance for his children the proper purpose in appointing a successor. The (succession to the rule) is something that comes from God who distinguishes by it whomsoever He
wishes.

It is necessary in (appointing a successor) to be as wellintentioned as possible. Otherwise, there is danger that one may trifle with religious institutions. God's is the kingdom (royal authority). 333 He gives it to those of His
servants to whom He wants to give it.

There are some matters in this connection which need explanation. First, there is the wickedness Yazid displayed when he was caliph. One should beware of thinking that Mu'awiyah could have known about it. Mu'awiyah's
probity and virtue were too great. While he lived, he censured Yazid for listening to
music and forbade him to do it, and (listening to music) is a lesser sin than (Yazid's
later wickedness) and is judged differently by the different schools.
When Yazid's well-known wickedness showed itself, the men around
Muhammad disagreed about what to do with him. Some were of the opinion that
they should revolt against him and declare the oath of allegiance that had been
rendered to him invalid on account of (his wickedness). This was the attitude taken
by al-Husayn, 'Abdallah b. az-Zubayr, and others. Others rejected that (course of
action), because it threatened to stir up a revolt and to cause much bloodshed. In
addition, (they knew that) they would be too weak to achieve success. Yazid's
strength at that time lay in the Umayyad group feeling and in the Qurashite majority
who exercised all executive authority. It was they who controlled the group feeling
of all the Mudar. Thus, they possessed greater strength than anyone else, and no
resistance to them was possible. Therefore, (the above-mentioned persons knew that
they) were not in a position to do anything against Yazid. They prayed that he might
find guidance or that they might be relieved of him. This was the course the majority
of the Muslims followed. Both parties (of the opposition to Yazid) used their
independent judgment. Neither of them may be considered at fault. It is well known
that all their intentions were determined by piety and championship of the truth.
May God enable us to follow their model.
Second= There is the matter of the appointment of a successor by the Prophet.
The Shi'ah claim that Muhammad appointed 'Ali his heir. This is not correct. No
leading transmitter of traditions has reported such a thing. It is stated in (the sound
tradition of) the Sahih that Muhammad asked for ink and paper in order to write his
will, and that 'Umar prevented it. 334 This clearly shows that (the appointment of 'Ali
as successor) did not take place.
There also is the following statement by 'Umar, made after he had been
stabbed and when he was asked about appointing a successor= "Were I to appoint a
successor, it would be because someone who is better than I appointed a successor"-
meaning Abu Bakr-"and were I not to appoint a successor, it would be because
someone who is better than I did not" -meaning the Prophet. 335 And the men around
Muhammad were present and agreed with him that the Prophet 336 had not
appointed a successor.
There is also the statement of 'Ali to al-'Abbas. Al'Abbas invited 'All to go into the Prophet (with him), and they both were to ask the Prophet how they stood with regard to being appointed as his successor. 

All, however, refused and said= "If he keeps us from (the caliphate), we cannot hope ever to get it." 337 This shows that 'All knew that Muhammad had not made a will and had not appointed anyone his successor. 

The doubt of the Imamiyah in this matter is caused by the fact that they assume the imamate to be one of the pillars of the faith. 338 This is not so. It is one of the general (public) interests. The people are delegated to take care of it. If it
were one of the pillars of the faith, it would be something like prayer, and (Muhammad) would have appointed a representative (caliph), exactly as he appointed Abu Bakr to represent him at prayer. (Had he done so,) it would have become generally known, as was the case with the matter of prayer. 

The men around Muhammad considered the caliphate as something analogous to prayer and on the strength of that attitude argued in favor of Abu Bakr's caliphate, saying, "The Messenger of God found him acceptable for our religion. So, why should we not
accept him for our worldly affairs?" 339 is merely another proof of the fact that no appointment of an heir had taken place. It also shows that the question of the imamate and succession to it was not as important then as it is today. Group feeling,
which determines unity and disunity in the customary course of affairs, was not of
the same significance then (as it was later on). (At that time,) Islam was winning the
hearts of the people and causing them to be willing to die for it in a way that
disrupted the customary course of affairs. That happened because people observed
with their own eyes the presence of angels to help them, the repeated appearance of
heavenly messages among them, and the constant (Qur'anic) recitation of divine
pronouncements to them in connection with every happening. Thus, it was not
necessary to pay any attention to group feeling. Men generally had the coloring of
submissiveness and obedience. They were thoroughly frightened and perturbed by a
sequence of extraordinary miracles and other divine happenings, and by frequent
visitations of angels.340 Such questions as that of the caliphate, of royal authority,
succession, group feeling, and other such matters, were submerged in this turmoil
the way it happened.

These helpful (circumstances) passed with the disappearance of miracles and the death of the generations that had witnessed them with their own eyes. The coloring mentioned changed little by little. The impression the wonders had made
passed, and affairs took again their ordinary course. 

The influence of group feeling and of the ordinary course of affairs manifested itself in the resulting good and bad
institutions. The questions of caliphate and royal authority and that of the
succession to both became very important affairs in the opinion of the people. It had
not been this way before. It should be noted how unimportant the caliphate was in
the time of the Prophet, (so unimportant that) he did not appoint a successor to it. Its importance then increased somewhat during the time of the (early) caliphs because there arose certain needs in connection with military protection, the holy war, the
apostasy (of Arab tribes after Muhammad's death), and the conquests. The (first
caliphs) could decide whether they would (appoint successors) or not. We mentioned
this on the authority of 'Umar. Subsequently, as at the present time, the matter has
become most important in connection with harmony in (military) protection and the
administration of public interests. Group feeling has come to play a role in it.
(Group feeling is) the secret divine (factor that) restrains people from splitting up
and abandoning each other. It is the source of unity and agreement, and the
guarantor of the intentions and laws of Islam. When this is understood, God's wise
plans with regard to His creation and His creatures will become clear. 341
Third= There are the wars that took place in Islam among the men aroundMuhammad and the men of the second generation. It should be known that their differences concerned religious matters only, and arose from independent interpretation of proper arguments and considered insights. Differences may well arise among people who use independent judgment. Now, we may say that in the case of problems that are open to independent judgment, the truth can lie only on one side, and that he who does not hit upon it is in error. But, since it has not been clearly indicated by general consensus on which side (the truth lies), every side may be assumed to be right. The side that is in error is not clearly indicated, either. 

To declare all sides to be at fault is not acceptable according to the general consensus.
Again, we may say that all sides have the true answer and that "everybody who uses
independent judgment is right." 342 Then, it is all the more necessary to deny that
any one side was in error or ought to be considered at fault.
The differences between the men around Muhammad and the men of the
second generation were no more than differences in the independent interpretation
of equivocal religious problems, and they have to be considered in this light.
