Dynasty and government serve as the world's greatest marketplace, 674 providing the substance of civilization. 

If the ruler holds on to property and revenue, or if they are lost or not properly used by him, then the property in the possession of the ruler's entourage 675 will be small. 

The gifts which they, in their turn, had been used to give to their entourage and people, stop, and all their expenditures are cut down. They constitute the greatest number of people (who make expenditures), and their expenditures provide more of the substance of trade than (the expenditures of) any other (group of people). Thus
(when they stop spending), business slumps and commercial profits decline because
of the shortage of capital. Revenues from the land tax decrease, because the land tax
and taxation (in general) depend on cultural activity, commercial transactions,
business prosperity, and the people's demand for gain and profit. 

It is the dynasty
that suffers from the situation and that has a deficit, because under these
circumstances the property of the ruler decreases in consequence of the decrease in
revenues from the land tax. As we have stated, the dynasty is the greatest market,
the mother and base of all trade. (It is the market that provides) the substance of
income and expenditures (for trade). If government business slumps and the volume
of trade is small, the dependent markets will naturally show the same symptoms, and
to a greater degree. Furthermore, money circulates between subjects and ruler,
moving back and forth. Now, if the ruler keeps it to himself, it is lost to the subjects.
This is how God proceeds with His servants.


## 41. Injustice brings about the ruin of civilization

Attacks on people's property remove the incentive to acquire and gain property. People, then, become of the opinion that the purpose and ultimate destiny of (acquiring property) is to have it taken away from them. 

When the incentive to acquire and obtain property is gone, people no longer make
efforts to acquire any. The extent and degree to which property rights are infringed
upon determines the extent and degree to which the efforts of the subjects to acquire
property slacken. When attacks (on property) are extensive and general, extending
to all means of making a livelihood, business inactivity, too, becomes (general),
because the general extent of (such attacks upon property) means a general
destruction of the incentive (to do business). If the attacks upon property are but
light, the stoppage of gainful activity is correspondingly slight. Civilization and its
well-being as well as business prosperity depend on productivity and people's efforts
in all directions in their own interest and profit. When people no longer do business
in order to make a living, and when they cease all gainful activity, the business of
civilization slumps, and everything decays. People scatter everywhere in search of
sustenance, to places outside the jurisdiction of their present government. The
population of the particular region becomes light. The settlements there become
empty. The cities lie in ruins. The disintegration of (civilization) causes the
disintegration of the status of dynasty and ruler, because (their peculiar status)
constitutes the form of civilization and the form necessarily decays when its matter
(in this case, civilization) decays.676a

One may compare (here) the story which al-Mas'udi tells in connection with
the history of the Persians. 677 In the days of King Bahram b. Bahram, the
Mobedhan, the chief religious dignitary among the Persians, expressed to the King
his disapproval of the latter's injustice and neglect for the consequences that his
injustice must bring upon the dynasty. He did this through a parable, which he
placed in the mouth of an owl. The King, hearing the cry of (an owl), asked (the
Mobedhan) whether he understood what it was saying. (The Mobedhan) replied= "A
male owl wanted to marry a female owl. The female owl, as a condition prior to
consent, asked the male owl for the gift of twenty villages ruined in the days of
Bahram, that she might hoot in them. (The male owl) accepted her condition and
said to her= 'If the King continues to rule, I shall give you a thousand ruined villages.
This is of all wishes the easiest to fulfill.' "

The King was stirred out of his negligence by that story. He had a private
(talk) with the Mobedhan and asked him what he had in mind. (The Mobedhan)
replied= "O King, the might of royal authority materializes only through the religious
law, obedience toward God, and compliance with His commands and prohibitions.
The religious law persists only through royal authority. Mighty royal authority is
achieved only through men. Men persist only with the help of property. The only
way to property is through cultivation. The only way to cultivation is through
justice. Justice is a balance set up among mankind. The Lord set it up and appointed
an overseer of it, and that is the ruler. You, O King, went after the farms and took
them away from their owners and cultivators. They are the people who pay the land
tax and from whom one gets money. You gave their farms as fiefs to (your)
entourage and servants and to sluggards. They did not cultivate (the farms) and didnot heed the consequences. (They did not look for the things) that would be good for the farms. They were leniently treated with regard to the land tax (and were not asked to pay it), because they were close to the king. The remaining landowners
who did pay the land tax and cultivated their farms had to carry an unjust burden.

Therefore, they left their farms and abandoned their settlements. They took refuge in
farms that were far away or difficult (of access), and lived on them. Thus, cultivation
slackened, and the farms were ruined. There was little money, and soldiers and
subjects perished. Neighboring rulers coveted the Persian realm, because they were
aware of the fact that the basic materials that alone maintain the foundation of a
realm had been cut off."

When the King heard that, he proceeded to look into (the affairs of) his
realm. The farms were taken away from the intimates of the ruler and restored to
their owners. They were again treated, as they had formerly been treated. They
began again to cultivate (their farms). Those who had been weak gained in strength.
The land was cultivated, and the country became prosperous. There was much
money for the collectors of the land tax. The army was strengthened. The enemies'
sources of (strength) were cut off. The frontier garrisons were manned. The ruler
proceeded to take personal charge of his affairs. His days were prosperous, and his
realm was well organized.

The lesson this (story) teaches is that injustice ruins civilization. The ruin (of
civilization) has as its consequence the complete destruction of the dynasty. In this
connection, one should disregard the fact that dynasties (centered) in great cities
often infringe upon justice and still are not ruined. It should be known that this is the
result of a relationship that exists between such infringements and the situation of
the urban population. When a city is large and densely populated and unlimited in
the variety of its conditions, the loss it suffers from hostile acts and injustice is
small, because such losses take place gradually. Because of the great variety of
conditions and the manifold productivity of a particular city, any loss may remain
concealed. Its consequences will become visible only after some time. Thus, the
dynasty which committed the infringements (of justice) may be replaced before the
city is ruined. Another dynasty may make its appearance and restore the city with
the help of its wealth. Thus, the (previous) loss which had remained concealed, is
made up and is scarcely noticed. This, however, happens only rarely. The proven
fact is that civilization inevitably suffers losses through injustice and hostile acts, as
we have mentioned, and it is the dynasty that suffers therefrom.

Injustice should not be understood to imply only the confiscation of money
or other property from the owners, without compensation and without cause. It is
commonly understood in that way, but it is something more general than that.
Whoever takes someone's property, or uses him for forced labor, or presses an
unjustified claim against him, or imposes upon him a duty not required by the
religious law, does an injustice to that particular person. People who collect
unjustified taxes commit an injustice. Those who infringe upon property (rights)
commit an injustice. Those who take away property commit an injustice. Those who
deny people their rights commit an injustice. Those who, in general, take property
by force, commit an injustice. It is the dynasty that suffers from all these acts, in as
much as civilization, which is the substance of the dynasty, 677a is ruined when
people have lost all incentive.

It should be known that this is what the Lawgiver (Muhammad) actually had
in mind when he forbade injustice. He meant the resulting destruction and ruin of
civilization, which ultimately permits the eradication of the human species. This is
what the religious law quite generally and wisely aims at in emphasizing five things
as necessary the preservation of (1) the religion, (2) the soul (life), (3) the intellect,(4) progeny, and (5) property.

Since, as we have seen, injustice calls for the eradication of the (human)
species by leading to the ruin of civilization, it contains in itself a good reason for
being prohibited. Consequently, it is important that it be forbidden. There is ample
evidence for that in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. It is much too ample to have it
accurately or fully presented here.

If injustice were to be committed by every individual, the list of deterring
punishments that would then have been given for it (in the religious law) would be
as large as that given for the other (crimes) which lead to the destruction of the
human species and which everybody is capable of committing, such as adultery,
murder, and drunkenness. However, injustice can be committed only by persons
who cannot be touched, only by persons who have power and authority. Therefore,
injustice has been very much censured, and repeated threats against it have been
expressed in the hope that perhaps the persons who are able to commit injustice will
find a restraining influence in themselves.

It should not be objected that punishment for highway robbery is provided
for in the religious law, 679 and that (highway robbery) is an injustice that can be
committed only by someone who has the ability to commit it, in as much as the
highway robber, when he commits the robbery, must have the ability to do it. The
reply to that would be twofold:
First, it may be said that the punishment laid down for (highway robbery) is
for crimes against life or property that (the highway robber) commits. This is an
opinion held by many. The (punishment applies) only after one has gained power
over him and brought him to account for his crime. 680 Highway robbery itself has no
fixed legal punishment.

Second, it may be said that the highway robber cannot be described as
having the ability (to commit injustice), because we understand by ability to commit
injustice that the person has a free hand and there is no rival power, which means
that he has (a power to) bring about (complete) ruin. The ability of the highway
robber is merely an ability to cause fear. (This fear) then enables the highway robber
to take away the property of others. Everyone may defend himself against it,
according to both the religious and the political law. It is not, then, an ability that
could bring about (complete) ruin.
God has power to do what He wishes.

One of the greatest injustices and one which contributes most to the
destruction of civilization is the unjustified imposition of tasks and the use of the
subjects for forced labor. This is so because labor belongs to the things that
constitute capital, as we shall explain in the chapter on sustenance. 681 Gain and
sustenance represent the value realized from labor among civilized people. All their
efforts and all their labors are (means) for them (to acquire) capital and (to make a)
profit. They have no other way to make a profit except (through labor). Subjects
employed in cultural enterprises gain their livelihood and profit from such activities.
Now, if they are obliged to work outside their own field and are used for forced
labor unrelated to their (ordinary ways of) making a living, they no longer have any
profit and are thus deprived of the price of their labor, which is their capital (asset).
They suffer, and a good deal of their livelihood is gone, or even all of it. If this
occurs repeatedly, all incentive to cultural enterprise is destroyed, and they cease
utterly to make an effort. This leads to the destruction and ruin of civilization.
"God gives sustenance to whomever He wishes to give it, withoutaccounting." 682

An injustice even greater and more destructive of civilization and the
dynasty than (the one just mentioned) is the appropriation of people's property by
buying their possesions as cheaply as possible and then reselling the merchandise to
them at the highest possible prices by means of forced sales and purchases. Often,
people have to accept (high) prices with the privilege of later payment. They console
(themselves) for the loss they suffer (at the moment) with the hope that the market
will fluctuate in favor of the merchandise that had been sold to them at such a high
price, and that their loss will be canceled later on. But then, they are required to
make payment at once, and they are forced to sell the merchandise at the lowest
possible price. The loss involved in the two transactions affects their capital.683
This (situation) affects all kinds of merchants, those resident in town and
those who import merchandise from elsewhere. (It also affects) the peddlers and
shopkeepers who deal in food and fruit, as well as the craftsmen who deal in the
instruments and implements that are in general use. The loss affects all professions
and classes quite generally. This goes on from hour to hour. 684 It causes (all) capital
funds to dwindle. The only possibility that remains is for the merchants to go out of
business, because their capital is gone, as it can no longer be restored by the profits.
Merchants who come from elsewhere for the purchase and sale of merchandise are
slow to come, because of that situation. Business declines, and the subjects lose their
livelihood, which, generally, comes from trading. Therefore, if no (trading) is being
done in the markets, they have no livelihood, and the tax revenue of the ruler
decreases or deteriorates, since, in the middle (period) of a dynasty and later on,
most of the tax revenue comes from customs duties on commerce, as we have stated
before. 685 This leads to the dissolution of the dynasty and the decay of urban
civilization. The disintegration comes about gradually and imperceptibly.

This happens whenever the ways and means of seizing property described
above are used. On the other hand, if (the property) is taken outright and if the
hostile acts are extended to affect the property, the wives, the lives, the skins,685a
and the honor of people, it will lead to sudden disintegration and decay and the
quick destruction of the dynasty. It will result in disturbances leading to complete
destruction.

On account of these evil (consequences), all such (unfair activities) are
prohibited by the religious law. The religious law legalizes the use of cunning in
trading, but forbids depriving people of their property illegally. The purpose is to
prevent such evil (consequences), which would lead to the destruction of civilization
through disturbances or the lack of opportunity to make a living.
It should be known that all these (practices) are caused by the need for more
money on the part of dynasty and ruler, because they have become accustomed to
luxurious living. Their expenditures increase, and much spending is done. The
ordinary income does not meet (the expenditures). Therefore, the ruler invents new
sorts and kinds of taxes, in order to increase the revenues and to be able to balance
the budget. But luxury continues to grow, and spending increases on account of it.
The need for (appropriating) people's property becomes stronger and stronger. In
this way, the authority of the dynasty shrinks until its influence is wiped out and its
identity lost and it is defeated by an attacker.
