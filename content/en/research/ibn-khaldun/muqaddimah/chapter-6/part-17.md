This belongs to the sciences of the religious law. It originated in Islam when the sciences became crafts 553 and scholars wrote books on them. 

Dream visions and dream interpretation existed among the ancients, as among later generations. It existed among former (pre-Islamic) religious groups and nations. However, their dream interpretation did not reach us, 554 because we have been
satisfied with the discussions of Muslim dream interpreters. 

In any case, all human beings can have dream visions, and these visions must be interpreted.

Truthful Joseph already interpreted visions, as is mentioned in the Qur'an. 555

Sound tradition in) the Sahih, on the authority of the Prophet and on the authority of Abu Bakr, likewise establishes (the existence of dream visions). Dream vision is a kind of supernatural perception. Muhammad said= "A good dream vision is the 46th part of prophecy." 556 He also said= "The only remaining bearer of glad tidings is a good dream vision, beheld by - or shown to - a good man." 557 

The revelation given to the Prophet began with a dream vision. Every dream vision he saw appeared to him like the break of dawn. When Muhammad went away from the morning prayer, he used to ask the men around him, "Did any one of you see a
dream vision during the night?" He asked this question in order to derive good news
from dream visions, which might refer to the victory of Islam and the growth of its
power.558

The reason for perception of the supernatural in dream visions is as follows:
559 The spirit of the heart, which is the fine vapor coming from the cavity in the
flesh of the heart, spreads into the veins and, through the blood, to all the rest of the
body. It serves to perfect the actions and sensations of the animal powers. The
(spirit) may be affected by lassitude, because it is very busy with the sensual
perception of the five senses and with the employment of the external powers. When
the surface of the body, then, is covered by the chill of night, the spirit withdraws
from all the other regions of the body to its center, the heart. It rests, in order to be
able to resume its activity, and all the external senses are (for the time being)
unemployed. This is the meaning of sleep, as was mentioned before at the beginning
of the book. Now, the spirit of the heart is the vehicle of man's rational spirit.
Through its essence, the rational spirit perceives everything that is in the divine
world, since its reality and its essence are identical with perception. It is prevented
from assimilating any supernatural perception by the veil of its preoccupation with
the body and the corporeal powers and senses. If it were without that veil or stripped
of it, it would return to its reality, which is identical with perception. It would thus
be able to assimilate any object of perception. If it were stripped of part of it, its
preoccupation would be less. It is thus able to catch a glimpse of its own world,
since external sense perception, its greatest preoccupation, now occupies it less. Its
(supernatural perception) corresponds (in intensity) to the degree to which the veil is
withdrawn from it. Thus it becomes prepared to receive the available perceptions
from its own world that are appropriate for it. When it has perceived these
perceptions from its own worlds, it returns with them to its body, since, as long as it
remains in its corporeal body, it cannot be active except through corporeal means of
perception.The faculties through which the body perceives knowledge are all connected
with the brain. The active part among them is the imagination. It derives imaginary
pictures from the pictures perceived by the senses and turns them over to the power
of memory, which retains them until they are needed in connection with speculation
and deduction. From the (imaginary pictures), the soul also abstracts other spiritual-
intellectual pictures. In this way, abstraction ascends from the sensibilia to the
intelligibilia. The imagination is the intermediary between them. Also, when the soul
has received a certain number of perceptions from its own world, it passes them on
to the imagination, which forms them into appropriate pictures and turns those
perceptions over to the common sense. As a result, the sleeper sees them as if they
were perceived by the senses. Thus, the perceptions come down from the rational
spirit to the level of sensual perception, with the imagination again being the
intermediary. This is what dream visions actually are.
The (preceding) exposition shows the difference between true dream visions
and false, "confused dreams." All of them are pictures in the imagination while an
individual is asleep. However, if these pictures come down from the rational spirit
that perceives (them), they are dream visions. But if they are derived from the
pictures preserved in the power of memory, where the imagination deposits them
when the individual is awake, they are "confused dreams." 560
It 561 should be known that true dream visions have signs indicating their
truthfulness and attesting their soundness, so that the person who has the dream
vision becomes conscious of the glad tidings from God given him in his sleep.
The first of these signs is that the person who has the dream vision wakes up
quickly, as soon as he has perceived it. It seems as if he is in a hurry to get back to
being awake and having sensual perception. Were he (to continue) to sleep soundly,
the perception given him would weigh heavily on him. Therefore, he tries to escape
from the state (in which he has supernatural perception) to the state of sensual
perception in which the soul is always fully immersed in the body and the corporeal
accidents.

Another sign is that the dream vision stays and remains impressed with all its
details in the memory of (the person who perceived it). Neither neglect nor
forgetfulness affects it. No thinking or remembering is required, in order to have it
present (to one's mind). The (dream vision) remains pictured in the mind of (the
dreamer) when he awakes. Nothing of it is lost to him. This is because perception by
the soul does not take place in time and requires no consecutive order, but takes
place all at once and within a single time element. 562 "Confused dreams," on the
other hand, take place in time, because they rest in the powers of the brain and are
brought from the power of memory to the common sense by the imagination, as we
have stated. (The process is an action of the body,) and all actions of the body take
place in time. Thus, they (require) a consecutive order, in order to perceive anything,
with something coming first and something else coming later. Forgetfulness, which
always affects the powers of the brain, affects (them). That is not the case with the
perceptions of the rational soul. They do not take place in time and have no
consecutive order. Perceptions that are impressed in (the rational soul) are impressed
all at once in the briefest moment. Thus, after (the sleeper) is awake, (his) dream
vision remains present in his memory for quite some time. In no way does it slip his
mind as the result of neglect, if it originally made a strong impression. However, if it
requires thinking and application to remember a dream vision after a sleeper is
awake, and if he has forgotten many of its details before he can remember them
again, the dream vision is not a true one but a "confused dream."
These signs belong in particular to (prophetic) revelation. God said to HisProphet= "Do not set your tongue in motion to make haste with (the revelation of the
Qur'an). It is up to us to put it together and to recite it. And when we recite it, follow
its recitation. Then, it is up to us to explain it." 563 Dream visions are related to
prophecy and revelation, as is stated in (the sound tradition of) the Sahih. Thus,
Muhammad said= "A dream vision is the forty-sixth part of prophecy." 564 In the
same way, the characteristics of dream visions are related to the characteristics of
prophecy. One should not consider that as unlikely. It appears to be this way.
God creates whatever He wishes to create.

As to the idea of dream interpretation, the following should be known. The
rational spirit has its perceptions and passes them on to the imagination. (The
imagination) then forms them into pictures but it forms them only into such pictures
as are somehow related to the (perceived) idea. For instance, if the idea of a mighty
ruler is perceived, the imagination depicts it in the form of an ocean. Or, the idea of
hostility is depicted by the imagination in the form of a serpent. A person wakes up
and knows only that he saw an ocean or a serpent. Then, the dream interpreter, who
is certain that the ocean is the picture conveyed by the senses and that the perceived
idea is something beyond that picture, puts the power of comparison to work. He is
guided by further data that establish the character of the perceived idea for him.
Thus, he will say, for instance, that the ocean means a ruler, because an ocean is
something big with which a ruler can appropriately be compared. Likewise, a
serpent can appropriately be compared with an enemy, because it does great harm.
Also, vessels can be compared with women, because they are receptacles, and so
on. 565

Dream visions may be evident and require no interpretation, because they are
clear and distinct, or because (the ideas) perceived in them may be very similar to
(the pictures) by which they are represented. Therefore, it has been said in (the
sound tradition of) the Sahih, "There are three kinds of dream visions. There are
dream visions from God, dream visions from the angels, and dream visions from
Satan." 566 Dream visions from God are those that are evident and need no
explanation. Dream visions from an angel are true dreams that require interpretation.
And dream visions from Satan are "confused dreams."

It should be known that when the spirit passes its perceptions on to the
imagination, (the latter) depicts them in the customary molds of sensual perception.
Where such molds never existed in sensual perception, (the imagination) 567 cannot
form any pictures. A (person who was) born blind could not depict a ruler by an
ocean, an enemy by a serpent, or women by vessels, because he had never perceived
any such things. For him, the imagination would depict those things through
similarly appropriate (pictures) derived from the type of perceptions with which he
is familiar - that is, things which can be heard or smelled. The dream interpreter
must be on guard against such things. They often cause confusion in dream
interpretation and spoil its rules.
The science of dream interpretation implies a knowledge of general norms
upon which the dream interpreter bases the interpretation and explanation of what he
is told. For instance, they say that an ocean represents a ruler. Elsewhere, they say
that an ocean represents wrath. Again, elsewhere, they say that it represents worry
and calamity. Or, they say that a serpent represents an enemy, but elsewhere they
say that it represents one who conceals a secret. Elsewhere again, they say that it
represents life, and so on. 568

The dream interpreter knows these general norms by heart and interprets the dreams in each case as required by the data establishing which of these norms fits a particular dream vision best. The data may originate in the waking state. They mayoriginate in the sleeping state. Or, they may be created in the soul of the dream interpreter himself by the special quality with which he is endowed. 

Everyone is successful at the things for which he was created. 569

This science never ceased being transmitted in the circles of the early Muslims. Muhammad b. Sirin 570 was one of the most famous experts in (dream interpretation) among them. Certain norms of dream interpretation were written down on his authority. 

People have transmitted them down to this time. Al-Kirmani 571 wrote on the subject after Ibn Sirin. Recent scholars have
written many works on it. The books in use among contemporary Maghribis are the Mumti' and other works by Ibn Abi Talib al-Qayrawini, 572 a scholar from al-Qayrawan, and the Kitab al-Isharah by as-Salimi 573 which is one of the most
useful and briefest 574 books on the subject. 

There also is the Kitab al-Marqabah al- 'ulya by Ibn Rashid, 575 who belonged to (the circle of) our shaykhs in Tunis.
Dream interpretation is a science resplendent with the light of prophecy,
because prophecy and dreams are related to each other, and (dreams) played a part
in the (prophetic) revelation, as has been established in sound tradition.
