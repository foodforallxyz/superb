There is only ONE MOMENT in all creation - the eternal NOW.

"Time" is an illusion created by consciousness.

In a film projector, the individual frames of the film are shown in a rapid steady sequence - one frame at a time.   This rapid steady sequence of STILL frames creates the ILLUSION of flowing time. 

But in truth, all the actual frames that are used all exist simultaneously. There is the illusion of "time" only when the film projector displays those frames - one frame at a time - in a rapid steady sequence. Yet, ALL those frames exist simultaneously. In fact the projectionist can take out the roll of film, spread it out on the floor and view all those frames at the same time.

In a similar manner, our consciousness "projects" individual "still frames of reality" in a steady and extremely rapid sequence. Bashar says we do this BILLIONS of times per second - thus creating the ILLUSION of the steady flow of TIME.     

Each of these individual "still frames of reality" contains absolutely NO MOTION whatsoever! It is a frozen snapshot - perfectly still.   And yet, by sequencing these still frames at a steady very-fast rate, we have the ILLUSION of time - the flow of time.

(NOTE=  The actutal "flash-rate" or "frame-rate" for the physical dimension that we are experiencing is an extremely tiny increment of time, defined by Plank's constant.)

Our earthly consciousness functions like the film projector, which views these still frames only in a rapid steady sequence.

Our Higher Self functions like the film projectionist,  who can take out the roll of film and view ALL the frames simultaneously.   Our Higher Self functions in a timeless eternal-NOW zone.

Therefore, all time is truly NOW. Your past lives are occurring right NOW. Your future lives are occurring right NOW. All time periods are co-existing right NOW.  The concept of "reincarnation" is not quite as accurate as "simultaneous multiple incarnations".

Normally, the "reality-frames" that we view in rapid sequence are related and similar. Hence the ILLUSION of continuity.


### Continuity is an ILLUSION.

Continuity is an ILLUSION since one is not obligated to go from one frame to another frame that is almost the same.  (The "normal" flow of time.)   It is possible to "hop" to a totally-different frame in this infinite universe.    And this would be what is normally referred to as "Time Travel".

There is no paradox in Time Travel.

There is no paradox in Time Travel. The classic "grandfather paradox" of time-travel is not really a paradox at all. This classic paradox basically states= 


#### Question=  If you travel back to the time of your grand-father and kill him before he has any children, then your father could not have been born. Then you also could not have been born. So, if you were never born, how could you go back in time to kill your grand-father?

### SOLUTION=  There are an infinite number of time-lines - all simultaneously co-existing.  (parallel but distinct time-tracks, or "flows", of time events)   Every time you "Time Travel" in the classic sense, to the past or future, you are hopping over to a DIFFERENT time-line, not the one that you have been living in.   So anything you do in THAT time-line is part of the "natural history" of THAT time-line, but there was no change whatsoever in your originating time-line.    This DIFFERENT time-line may appear to be practically identical to your own past or future, but it is in fact a totally DIFFERENT time-line.   Hence, no paradox.




The PRESENT is not the result of the PAST.
The PRESENT is the result of the PRESENT.

Creation occurs only in the PRESENT. The PRESENT is the Now result of what you Now believe to be most true for you.   Continuity from one present moment to the next is considered "normal", but is actually optional=  If you suddenly make a discrete shift in beliefs, you will experience a sudden discrete shift in your Now reality.  The PRESENT is the Now result of what you Now believe to be most true for you. 

The past has absolutely no effect on the present - except to the extent that you believe it does.

As you change your present (by changing your present beliefs), you are "shifting" into a different parallel reality and that different parallel reality has its own "future" and "past". Said another way, when you change your present, you are likewise also changing your past and your future. That is, you are shifting to a totally different hologram which contains its own "past" that is consistent with its "present", and also its own "future" which is likewise consistent with its "present".    As I believe Bashar says=  "You create the past and the future from the here and now."

Continuity is an "illusion", just like the continuity in movies is an illusion, since it's really 24 discrete pictures per second. Therefore, continuity is optional. The past progressively leads to the present, but it does not cause the present. And just as movies can suddenly shift from one scene to a totally different scene, likewise you can too - since continuity is really not necessary.

Only the present is real. Therefore only the present can create the present.

If you insist in believing that the present is the result of the past, then you are (now) dragging the past into the present, and (now) "projecting" that this seeming past has an effect on the present. (Notice, by the way, that all this "dragging the past into the present" is also all occurring ONLY in the present.)    This is like dragging an anchor around, rather than simply letting go of the anchor (the past) and living freely and easily in the present.   Be free of the past!   Live joyously in the present!
How FEAR can Serve You

Fear means that you believe, that a scenario that you very much do not want to happen, is very likely to happen!

So fear lets you know that you are believing in a reality that you do not prefer.  So, fear can serve you, by being an "indicator", or an "alarm", that lets you know that    "Hey, I'm believing in a reality that is not at all aligned with my Being!"

Once you become aware of this, you can choose to change your belief, so such frightening scenarios will no longer pop up in your reality.

1. Get  in touch with the Belief that is causing this fear.

Ask yourself=    "What would I have to believe, in order to end up being afraid of this right now?"

2. Once you get in touch with the Belief that is generating this fear. 

Then acknowledge that this is your current Believe. "Own" it.    (You can not change what you do not own.)

3. Ask yourself=  "What Belief would I like to REPLACE this Belief with?"

4. Once you decide what your new preferred Belief is, accept it. Adopt it. Breath it in. TRUST that this new Belief is now active and functioning in your Being. (You don't need to "get rid of" the old Belief. You only need to replace it with your preferred Belief.)

Get into the Mind-Set of the new Belief.
Get into the Emotional-Feeling State of the new Belief.
Get into the Body-Language and Actions of the new Belief.
