## Neutral Props

In a theater that shows many plays, there may be some props back-stage that are frequently used for several different plays. For each play that prop has a special meaning, but outside that play, the prop has no innate intrinsic built-in meaning. All the props are basically without meaning. 

From this innate absence of meaning, we can assign any meaning we want to them.

Likewise, all the events that you experiencing as "happening" in your life are "neutral props".

Each event you experience has no innate intrinsic built-in meaning.

These events are blank, neutral, no innate significance. And from this "blank slate", we get to assign any significance or meaning we wish for each event we experience.

Normally, we assign and "project" a meaning onto a neutral situation so quickly and so automatically, that we are not even aware that we are doing it.
We "think" the interpretation or "meaning" is "built into" that situation. We are usually totally oblivious of that fact that we are the ones that are assigning a very specific meaning to what is actually a "neutral" event, with no built-in inherent meaning.

```Beliefs ==> Perception ==> Interpretation ==> Emotional reaction ==> Thoughts ==> Action```

```Positive  Interpretation ==> Positive  Desirable Experience```

```Negative Interpretation ==> Negative Undesirable Experience```

If you assign a positive meaning to an event, this will produce/attract a positive desirable experience for you.

If you assign a negative meaning to an event, this will produce/attract a negative undesirable experience for you.  

Imagine a story - line with a fork in the story, where the story could go either of two ways - one with a wonderful outcome and the other one totally unpleasant.

You are at this "fork" in the story-line, and the interpretation that you assign to this neutral situation totally determines which fork in this story line you will take (which version of reality you are choosing to experience).


The corollary to this is=  

If an event occurs to you that you would normally automatically assign a negative meaning to

("This is a real bummer!"), choose to assign a positive meaning to that event - even if it "appears" negative and you do not yet know what is so positive about it.   Just by assigning a positive meaning to this event and choosing to believe there is something really "good" about this for you, this will produce an experience that you will consider quite positive!    Try it!   Next time you think "This is just terrible!", turn it around and believe "This is really positive! This is really going to be good! I can't wait to find out what is positive about it!"   You may even be startled by how effectively this works.

Hard to do?
Okay, try this= 

"Okay, I know this looks just terrible. But I don't care! I am now going to DECIDE that this is JUST GREAT! (even though I can't imagine ANYTHING great about it!)     I'm not going to "hope" it's great. I'm not going to "pray" that it's great.  I am going to DECIDE that it's great, and I know that sooner or later, I will discover what is so wonderful about it."

First time you see this work, it will STUN you!   

It's like *Magic*!  It's like reality transforming right before your eyes.
