### The irregularity in our moral feelings on the outcome is caused by Nature trying to preserve our physical well-being without the uneeded psychological troubles

> Translator's note=  This part resembles Socrates' argument in the Republic

24 Such is the effect of an action's consequences on its doer and on others. Chance= 
- governs the world
- has some influence where we should be least willing to allow her any
- directs mankind's feelings about themselves and others.

In all ages, the complaint and the great discouragement of virtue is that the world judges by the outcome and not by the intention. There is a general maxim that as the outcome does not depend on the doer, the outcome should not influence our feelings, with regard to the morality of the doer's conduct. Everyone agrees to this maxim. But when we come to particulars, we find that our feelings do not exactly conform to this equitable maxim. Any action's happy or unhappy effect= 
- gives us a good or bad opinion of its prudence, and
- animates= 
  - our gratitude or resentment almost always, and
  - our sense of the merit or demerit of its design.


25 Nature implanted the seeds of this irregularity in the human breast. However, as on all other occasions, it did this with the intention of our species' happiness and perfection. If terrible planning or malevolent affections alone could trigger our resentment, then we would resent anyone who has such designs or affections even if they were never executed. Feelings, thoughts, and intentions, then would become the objects of punishment. Every court of justice would become a real inquisition= 
- if the people's hatred on suspected bad intentions would be the same as their hatred against actual actions, and
- if a thought's baseness, which created no action, called aloud for vengeance.

There would be no safety for the most innocent conduct. Bad wishes, bad views, bad designs, might still be suspected and these would lead to people being punished. The Author of nature rendered only the following actions as the proper objects of punishment and resentment= 
- those which produce actual evil, and
- those which put us in the immediate fear of actual evil.
<!--  and resentment= 
- while these excited the same indignation with bad conduct, and
- while bad intentions were as much resented as bad actions. -->

Human actions derive their whole merit or demerit from feelings and intentions. These are= 
- placed by the great Judge of hearts beyond the limits of human jurisdiction, and
- reserved for the cognizance of His own unerring tribunal.
<!-- ,
- designs,
- affections -->

The necessary rule of justice is that people are punished for their actions only, not for their designs or intentions. It is founded on this salutary and useful irregularity in human feelings on merit or demerit. At first sight, this irregularity appears so absurd and unaccountable. But when attentively surveyed, nature demonstrates the Author's providential care. We may admire God's wisdom and goodness even in man's weakness and folly.
 


### The Purpose of the Irregularity is to Create Action

26 This irregularity of feelings is not useless. The following appear imperfect= 
- the merit of an unsuccessful attempt to help, and
- the merit of mere good inclinations and kind wishes.

Man was made= 
- for action, and
- by the exertion of his faculties, to promote changes in everyone's external circumstances most favourable to everyone's happiness.

He must not= 
- be satisfied with indolent benevolence, nor
- fancy himself as the friend of mankind just because he wishes well.

Nature has taught him that other people cannot be fully satisfied with his conduct unless he has actually produced them. In this way, he might use his soul's whole vigour and strain every nerve to produce those ends his being was meant to advance. He is made to know, that the praise of good intentions, without the merit of good offices, will not the excite world's acclamations nor even the highest self-applause. The man who has performed no important action is entitled to no very high reward, even if= 
- his whole conversation and deportment express the justest, noblest, and most generous sentiments, and
- his uselessness was only due to the lack of an opportunity to serve.

We can still refuse it him without blame. We can still ask him= 
- What have you done?
- What actual service can you do to entitle you to so great a recompense?

We esteem and love you, but we owe you nothing. Only the most divine benevolence can insist to reward that latent virtue which has been useless only for the lack of an opportunity to help. We cannot bestow on it those honours and preferments, even if it deserves them. On the contrary, only the most barbarous tyranny would punish a person for having criminal feelings without committing any crime. 

The benevolent feelings deserve the most praise when they exert themselves without waiting. On the contrary, the malevolent feelings that never exert themselves into a crime deserves praise. 
<!-- cannot be too slow or deliberate. do not wait until it becomes almost a crime for them not to exert themselves. -->
 

27 It is even important that the unintended evil be regarded as a misfortune to the doer and the sufferer. Man is thereby taught to= 
- revere his brethren's happiness,
- tremble lest he should, even unknowingly, do anything that can hurt them, and
- dread that animal resentment which, he feels, is ready to burst out against him, if he should innocently be the unhappy cause of their calamity.

In the ancient heathen religion, holy ground should only be trod upon on solemn and necessary occasions. The man who ignorantly violated it incurred the vengeance of that powerful and invisible being to whom it had been set apart, until proper atonement has been made. So by the Nature's wisdom, the happiness of every innocent man is rendered holy and hedged round against the approach of every other man. It is not to be wantonly trod on, nor ignorantly and involuntarily violated, without requiring some apology or atonement proportional to the greatness of such undesigned violation.
A man of humanity, who accidentally has killed another man, feels himself requiring atonement, but not guilty.
During his whole life, he considers this accident as one of his greatest misfortunes.
If the family of the slain is poor and he himself is not poor, he immediately= 
- takes them under his protection, and
- without any other merit, thinks them entitled to every favour and kindness.

If they are in better circumstances, he tries to render them every good office which he can devise or they accept of= 
- by every submission, and
- by every expression of sorrow,
- in order to= 
  - atone for what has happened, and
  - propitiate their, natural but most unjust resentment, for his great but involuntary offence.


28 The finest and most interesting scenes of the ancient and modern drama are about an innocent person's distress. He had been led to do something which he did not know would expose him to the deepest reproach. This fallacious sense of guilt constitutes the distress of= 
- Oedipus and Jocasta on the Greek theatre, and
- Monimia and Isabella on the English theatre.

All of them need the most atonement, but not one of them are guilty.

 
29 Despite these seeming irregularities of sentiment, if man unfortunately causes those unintended evils, or fail to produce the intended good, Nature has not left= 
- his innocence without consolation, nor
- his virtue without reward.

He then calls to his assistance that just and equitable maxim, that those events which did not depend upon our conduct should not reduce the esteem that is due to us. He summons up his whole magnanimity and firmness of soul.
He strives to regard himself, not as how he appears now, but as how he should appear= 
- had his generous designs been successful, and
- if the men's sentiments were= 
- candid and equitable, or
- even perfectly consistent with themselves.

Mankind's more candid and humane part entirely goes along with his effort to support himself in his own opinion. They exert their whole generosity and greatness of mind to correct in themselves this irregularity of human nature. They try to regard his unfortunate magnanimity as if it been successful.
 


### Notes for this chapter

To most people, ascribing our natural sense of the demerit of actions to a sympathy with the sufferer's resentment is a degradation of that sense. People will think it impossible that the sense of the demerit of vice is based on resentment. They prefer that our sense of the merit of good actions is based on a sympathy with the gratitude of the beneficiaries. This is because gratitude, like the other benevolent feelings, is an amiable principle. Gratitude cannot reduce the value of whatever is founded on gratitude.

However, gratitude and resentment are opposites. If our sense of merit arises from a sympathy with the gratitude, then our sense of demerit must proceed from a fellow-feeling with the resentment. Resentment is probably the most odious of all the feelings. But it is not disapproved of when= 
- properly humbled, and
- entirely brought down to the level of the spectator's sympathetic indignation.

We bystanders approve of the sufferer's feelings when= 
- we our own animosity entirely corresponds with the sufferer's animosity,
- the sufferer's resentment does not go beyond our own resentment,
<!-- - no word, no gesture, escapes him that denotes an emotion more violent than what we can keep time to, and -->
- he never aims at inflicting any punishment beyond what we ourselves would want to inflict.

To us, our own feeling in this case justifies his. Experience teaches us= 
- how most people are incapable of this moderation, and
- how great an effort must be made to bring down the undisciplined impulse of resentment to this suitable temper.

We admire a sufferer who has so much self-command over his hatred against his offender. But when the sufferer's hatred exceeds our sympathy for it, we disapprove of it since we cannot enter into it. We even disapprove of it more than we disapprove of an equal excess of feeling from the imagination. We then resent his too-violent resentment instead of sympathizing with it. <!-- We enter into the opposite resentment of the person who is the object of this unjust emotion, and who is in danger of suffering from it.  --> 

This is why, revenge, as the excess of resentment, is the most detestable of all the feelings. A moderate feeling of revenge is commonly found in men. An excessive feeling of revenge is 100 times the strength of this moderate level.  We the excessive feeling of revenge as detestable because it is detestable in its most ordinary appearances.
<!-- It is the object of everyone's horror and indignation. -->
<!-- And as in the way in which revenge commonly discovers itself among mankind, it is excessive a hundred times for once that it is moderate. -->

A totally evil principle is something that cannot be the proper object of praise in any way. Even in mankind's present depraved state, Nature is not so unkind as to endow us with a totally evil principle. 

Revenge is generally too strong, but sometimes, it can also be too weak. We sometimes complain that a sufferer shows too little spirit and has too little sense of his injuries. We chastise him for this defect, just as we hate him for excessive revenge. Moralists would not have talked so strongly of God's wrath if they saw all levels of wrath as evil, even in man. 


#### Nature Uses Our Feelings to Create Morality to Sustain Life

This inquiry is not on a matter of right, but on a matter of fact. We are not examining how God would approve of the punishment of evil. We are examining how or on what principles man, a weak and imperfect creature, actually and factually approves of punishments.

These principles have a very great effect on men's feelings. Society's existence requires that unmerited and unprovoked malice should be restrained by proper punishments. Consequently, inflicting those punishments should be regarded as proper and laudable. Man is naturally endowed with a desire of society's welfare and preservation. Yet the Author of nature has entrusted it to man's feelings, and not to his reason, to find out the punishments that are proper to attain this end.

<!-- It seems wisely ordered that it should be so. -->
<!-- Instead, the Author has endowed man with an  approbation of that very application which is most proper to attain it. 
 is in this respect exactly of a piece with what it is up.  -->
Nature's favourite ends are the important ones. She has constantly endowed mankind with an appetite for those important ends, along with the means to achieve them for their own sakes. This means is seen in the immediate and instinctive approbation that makes up the oeconomy of nature.
<!-- , as on many other occasions.  -->
<!-- - the end she proposes.
- the means by which this end alone can be brought author = 
  - for their own sakes, and
  - independent of their tendency to produce it.
those with peculiar importance. -->

Thus, self-preservation and the propagation of the species, are the great ends which Nature proposed for all animals. Mankind is endowed with= 
<!-- - a desire of those ends
- an aversion to the contrary -->
- a love of life and a dread of dissolution
- a desire of the species' continuance and an aversion to its extinction.

But finding the proper means to realize those ends has not been entrusted to our reason's slow and uncertain determinations. Nature has directed us to the most of these by original and immediate instincts and feelings like hunger, thirst, lust, the love of pleasure and the dread of pain. These prompt us to= 
- apply those means for their own sakes, and
- without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends intended by the great Director of nature.


There is a difference between= 
- the approbation of propriety and
- the approbation of merit or beneficence.

Before we approve of anyone's feelings as proper and suitable to their objects, we must= 
- be affected in the same way as he is, and
- perceive this harmony and correspondence of sentiments between him and ourselves.

Thus, upon hearing of my friend's misfortune, I should precisely conceive his concern. But I cannot be said to approve of his feelings until= 
- I know how he behaves, and
- I perceive the harmony between his emotions and mine.

Therefore, the approbation of propriety requires that we should= 
- entirely sympathize with the person who acts, and
- perceive this perfect concord between his sentiments and our own.

On the contrary, when I hear of another person receiving benefit and, by bringing his case home to myself, I feel gratitude in my own breast, I necessarily approve of his benefactor's conduct.

I regard it as meritorious and the proper object of reward. Our feelings with regard to the benefactor's merit cannot be altered whether his beneficiary feels gratitude or not. No actual correspondence of sentiments is required here. It is enough that if he was grateful, they would correspond.
Our sense of merit is often founded on one of those illusive sympathies.

For example, when we bring home to ourselves another's case, we are often affected in a way in which the person principally concerned is incapable of being affected. There is a similar difference between our disapprobation of demerit, and that of impropriety.
