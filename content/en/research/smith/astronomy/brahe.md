Tycho Brahe introduced a new hypothesis that connected the irregularities in the motions of the Planets. 

He completed his Treatise of Revolutions but was afraid of what people might think so that he kept it in his closet for 30 years. 

Finally in old age, he allowed it to be published but died as soon as it was printed. It was almost immediately and universally disapproved of, by the learned as well as by the ignorant. 

One of his disciples was Reinholdus. He built astronomical tables called 'Prutenic Tables' that were more accurate than what was in the Treatise of Revolutions. These soon appeared to be corresponded more exactly with the
heavens, than the Tables of Alphonsus. 
<!-- 
This ought naturally to have formed a prejudice
in favour of the diligence and accuracy of Copernicus in observing the heavens. But it
ought to have formed none in favour of his hypothesis; since the same observations,
and the result of the same calculations, might have been accommodated to the system
of Ptolemy, without making any greater alteration in that system than what Ptolemy had
foreseen, and had even foretold should be made. It formed, however, a prejudice in
favour of both, and the learned begin to examine, with some attention, an hypothesis
which afforded the easiest methods of calculation, and upon which the most exact
predictions had been made. The superior degree of coherence, which it bestowed upon
the celestial appearances, the simplicity and uniformity which it introduced into the real
directions and velocities of the Planets, soon disposed many astronomers, first to
favour, and at last to embrace a system, which thus connected together so happily, the
most disjointed of those objects that chiefly occupied their thoughts. Nor can any thing
more evidently demonstrate, how easily the learned give up the evidence of their senses
to preserve the coherence of the ideas of their imagination, than the readiness with
which this, the most violent paradox in all philosophy, was adopted by many ingenious
astronomers, notwithstanding its inconsistency with every sistem of physics then known
in the world, and notwithstanding the great number of other more real objections, to
which, as Copernicus left it, this account of things was most justly exposed.

learned in all other sciences, continued to regard it with the same contempt as the
vulgar.

Even astronomers were divided about its merit; and many of them rejected a doctrine, which not only contradicted the established system of Natural Philosophy, but which, considered astronomically only, seemed to labour under several difficulties.

Some of the objections against the motion of the Earth, that were drawn from the
prejudices of sense, the patrons of this system, indeed, easily enough, got over. They
represented, that the Earth might really be in motion, though, to its inhabitants, it
seemed to be at rest; and that the Sun, and Fixed Stars, might really be at rest, though
which
from the Earth they seemed to be in motion; in the same manner as a ship,
sails through a smooth sea, seems to those who are in it, to be at rest, though really in
motion; while the objects which she passes along, seem to be in motion, though really
at rest.

But there were some other objections, which, though grounded upon the same natural
prejudices, they found it more difficult to get over. The Earth had always presented

itself to the senses, not only as at rest, but as inert, ponderous, and even averse to
motion. The imagination had always been accustomed to conceive it as such, and
suffered the greatest violence, when obliged to pursue, and attend it, in that rapid

motion which the system of Copernicus bestowed upon it.
the adversaries of this hypothesis were at pains to calculate the extreme rapidity of this
motion. They represented, that the circumference of the Earth had been computed to be
above twenty–three thousand miles=  if the Earth, therefore, was supposed to revolve
every day round its axis, every point of it near the equator would pass over above
twenty–three thousand miles in a day; and consequently, near a thousand miles in an
hour, and about sixteen miles in a minute; a motion more rapid than that of a cannon
ball, or even than the swifter progress of sound. The rapidity of its periodical revolution
was yet more violent than that of its diurnal rotation. How, therefore, could the
imagination ever conceive so ponderous a body to be naturally endowed with so
dreadful a movement? The Peripatetic Philosophy, the only philosophy then known in
still further confirmed this prejudice. That philosophy, by a very natural,
the world,
though, perhaps, groundless distinction, divided all motion into Natural and Violent.
Natural motion was that which flowed from an innate tendency in the body, as when a
stone fell downwards=  Violent motion, that which arose from external force, and which
was, in some measure, contrary to the natural tendency of the body, as when a stone
was thrown upwards, or horizontally. No violent motion could be lasting; for, being
constantly weakened by the natural tendency of the body, it would soon be destroyed.
The natural motion of the Earth, as was evident in all its parts, was downwards, in a
strait line to the center; as that of fire and air was upwards, in a strait line from the
center. It was the heavens only that revolved naturally in a circle. Neither, therefore,
the supposed revolution of the Earth round its own center, nor that round the Sun,
could be natural motions; they must therefore be violent, and consequently could be of

that gravity was,
no long continuance. It was in vain that Copernicus replied,
probably, nothing else besides a tendency in the different parts of the same Planet, to
unite themselves to one another; that this tendency took place, probably, in the parts of
the other Planets, as well as in those of the Earth; that it could very well be united with
a circular motion; that it might be equally natural to the whole body of the Planet, and
to every part of it; that his adversaries themselves allowed, that a circular motion was
natural to the heavens, whose diurnal revolution was infinitely more rapid than even
that motion which he had bestowed upon the Earth; that though a like motion was
natural to the Earth, it would still appear to be at rest to its inhabitants, and all the
parts of it to tend in a strait line to the center, in the same manner as at present. But
this answer, how satisfactory soever it may appear to be now, neither did nor could
appear to be satisfactory then. By admitting the distinction betwixt natural and violent
motions, it was founded upon the same ignorance of mechanical principles with the
objection. The systems of Aristotle and Hipparchus supposed, indeed, the diurnal motion
of the heavenly bodies to be infinitely more rapid than even that dreadful movement
which Copernicus bestowed upon the Earth. But they supposed, at the same time, that
those bodies were objects of a quite different species, from any we are acquainted with,
near the surface of the Earth, and to which, therefore, it was less difficult to conceive
that any sort of motion might be natural. Those objects, besides, had never presented
themselves to the senses, as moving otherwise, or with less rapidity, than these
systems represented them. The imagination, therefore, could feel no difficulty in following a representation which the senses had rendered quite familiar to it. But when
the Planets came to be regarded as so many Earths, the case was quite altered. The
imagination had been accustomed to conceive such objects as tending rather to rest
than motion; and this idea of their natural inertness, encumbered, if one may say so,
and clogged its flight, whenever it endeavoured to pursue them in their periodical
courses, and to conceive them as continually rushing through the celestial spaces, with
such violent and unremitting rapidity.

Nor were the first followers of Copernicus more fortunate in their answers to some other
objections, which were founded indeed in the same ignorance of the laws of motion, but
which, at the same time, were necessarily connected with that way of conceiving things,
which then prevailed universally in the learned world.

If the Earth revolved so rapidly from west to east, then= 
- a perpetual wind would set in from east to west, more violent than what blows in the greatest hurricanes. 
- a stone thrown westwards would fly to a much greater distance than one thrown with the same force eastwards; 

as what moved in a direction, contrary to the motion of the Earth, would necessarily pass over a greater portion of its surface, than what, with the same velocity, moved along with it. 

A ball dropped from the mast of a moving ship does not fall precisely at the foot of the mast, but behind it. In the same
manner, a stone dropt from a high tower would not, upon the supposition of the Earth’s motion, fall precisely at the bottom of the tower, but west of it, the Earth being, in the mean time, carried away eastward from below it. 

## Relativity 

The followers of Copernicus tried to elude this objection, which, before the doctrine of the Composition of Motion had been explained was altogether unanswerable. 

They allowed, that a ball dropped from the by Galileo, mast of a ship under sail would not fall at the foot of the mast, but behind it; because the ball, they said, was no part of the ship, and because the motion of the ship was natural neither to itself nor to the ball. 

But the stone was a part of the earth, and the diurnal and annual revolutions of the Earth were natural to the whole, and to every part of it, and therefore to the stone. 

The stone, therefore, having naturally the same motion with the Earth, fell precisely at the bottom of the tower. But this answer could not satisfy the imagination, which still found it difficult to conceive how these motions could
be natural to the Earth; or how a body, which had always presented itself to the senses as inert, ponderous, and averse to motion, should naturally be continually wheeling about both its own axis and the Sun, with such violent rapidity. 

It was, besides, argued by Tycho Brache, upon the principles of the same philosophy, which had afforded both
the objection and the answer, that even upon the supposition, that any such motion was
natural to the whole body of the Earth, yet the stone, which was separated from it,
could no longer be actuated by that motion. The limb, which is cut off from an animal,
loses those animal motions which were natural to the whole. The branch, which is cut
off from the trunk, loses that vegetative motion which is natural to the whole tree. 

Even the metals, minerals, and stones, which are dug out from the bosom of the Earth, lose
those motions which occasioned their production and encrease, and which were natural
to them in their original state. Though the diurnal and annual motion of the Earth,
therefore, had been natural to them while they were contained in its bosom; it could no
longer be so when they were separated from it.

Tycho Brache was the great restorer and advancer of Astronomy. He spent his life and wasted his fortune on it. His  observations were both more numerous and more accurate than those of all the astronomers who
had gone before him. 

, was himself so much affected by the force of this objection, that,
though he never mentioned the system of Copernicus without some note of the high
admiration he had conceived for its author, he could never himself be induced to
embrace it=  yet all his astronomical observations tended to confirm it. They
demonstrated, that Venus and Mercury were sometimes above, and sometimes below
the Sun; and that, consequently, the Sun, and not the Earth, was the center of their
periodical revolutions. 

They showed, that Mars, when in his meridian at midnight, was nearer to the Earth than the Earth is to the Sun; though, when in conjunction with the Sun, he was much more remote from the Earth than that luminary; a discovery which
was absolutely inconsistent with the system of Ptolemy, which proved, that the Sun,
and not the Earth, was the center of the periodical revolutions of Mars, as well as of
Venus and Mercury; and which demonstrated, that the Earth was placed betwixt the
orbits of Mars and Venus. 

They made the same thing probable with regard to Jupiter and Saturn; that they, too, revolved round the Sun; and that, therefore, the Sun, if not the center of the universe, was at least, that of the planetary system. They proved, that
Comets were superior to the Moon, and moved through the heavens in all possible directions; an observation incompatible with the Solid Spheres of Aristotle and Purbach, and which, therefore, overturned the physical part, at least, of the established
Astronomy.

All these observations, joined to his aversion to the system, and perhaps, notwithstanding the generosity of his character, some little jealousy of the fame of in which the Earth Copernicus, suggested to Tycho the idea of a new hypothesis,
continued to be, as in the old account, the immoveable center of the universe, round
which the firmament revolved every day from east to west, and, by some secret virtue,
carried the Sun, the Moon, and the Five Planets along with it, notwithstanding their
immense distance, and notwithstanding that there was nothing betwixt it and them but
the most fluid ether. But, although all these seven bodies thus obeyed the diurnal
revolution of the Firmament, they had each of them, as in the old system, too, a
contrary periodical eastward revolution of their own, which made them appear to be
every day, more or less, left behind by the Firmament. The Sun was the center of the
periodical revolutions of the Five Planets; the Earth, that of the Sun and Moon. The Five
Planets followed the Sun in his periodical revolution round the Earth, as they did the
Firmament in its diurnal rotation. The three superior Planets comprehended the Earth
within the orbit in which they revolved round the Sun, and had each of them an Epicycle
to connect together, in the same manner as in the system of Ptolemy, their direct,
retrograde, and stationary appearances. As, notwithstanding their immense distance,
they followed the Sun in his periodical revolution round the Earth, keeping always at an
equal distance from him, they were necessarily brought much nearer to the Earth when
in opposition to the Sun, than when in conjunction with him. Mars, the nearest of them,
when in his meridian at midnight, came within the orbit which the Sun described round
the Earth, and consequently was then nearer to the Earth than the Earth was to the
Sun. The appearances of the two inferior Planets were explained, in the same manner,
as in the system of Copernicus, and consequently required no Epicycle to connect them.

The circles in which the Five Planets performed their periodical revolutions round the
Sun, as well as those in which the Sun and Moon performed theirs round the Earth,
were, as both in the old and new hypothesis, Eccentric Circles, to connect together their
differently accelerated and retarded motions.

Such was the system of Tycho Brache, compounded, as is evident, out of these of
Ptolemy and Copernicus; happier than that of Ptolemy, in the account which it gives of
the motions of the two inferior Planets; more complex, by supposing the different
revolutions of all the Five to be performed round two different centers; the diurnal round
the Earth, the periodical round the Sun; but, in every respect, more complex and more
incoherent than that of Copernicus. Such, however, was the difficulty that mankind felt
in conceiving the motion of the Earth, that it long balanced the reputation of that
otherwise more beautiful system. It may be said, that those who considered the
heavens only, favoured the system of Copernicus, which connected so happily all the
appearances which presented themselves there. But that those who looked upon the
Earth, adopted the account of Tycho Brache, which, leaving it at rest in the center of the
universe, did less violence to the usual habits of the imagination. The learned were,
indeed, sensible of the intricacy, and of the many incoherences of that system; that it
gave no account why the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, should follow the revolution of
the Firmament; or why the Five Planets, notwithstanding the immense distance of the
three superior ones, should obey the periodical motion of the Sun; or why the earth,
though placed between the orbits of Mars and Venus, should remain immoveable in the
center of the Firmament, and constantly resist the influence of whatever it was, which
carried bodies that were so much larger than itself, and that were placed on all sides of
it, periodically round the Sun. Tycho Brahe died before he had fully explained his
system. His great and merited renown disposed many of the learned to believe, that,
had his life been longer, he would have connected together many of these incoherences,
and knew methods of adapting his system to some other appearances, with which none
of his followers could connect it.
44
The objection to the system of Copernicus, which was drawn from the nature of motion,
and that was most insisted on by Tycho Brahe, was at last fully answered by Galileo;
not, however, till about thirty years after the death of Tycho, and about a hundred after
that of Copernicus. It was then that Galileo, by explaining the nature of the composition
of motion, by showing, both from reason and experience, that a ball dropt from the
mast of a ship under sail would fall precisely at the foot of the mast, and by rendering
this doctrine, from a great number of other instances, quite familiar to the imagination,
took off, perhaps, the principal objection which had been made to this hypothesis.
45
Several other astronomical difficulties, which encumbered this account of things, were
removed by the same philosopher. Copernicus, after altering the center of the world,
and making the Earth, and all the Planets revolve round the Sun, was obliged to leave
the Moon to revolve round the Earth as before. But no example of any such secondary
Planet having then been discovered in the heavens, there seemed still to be this
irregularity remaining in the system. Galileo, who first applied telescopes to

round either the Earth, or the Sun, made it seem less contrary to the analogy of nature,
that the Moon should both revolve round the Earth, and accompany her in her
revolution round the Sun.
46
It had been objected to Copernicus, that, if Venus and Mercury revolved round the Sun,
in an orbit comprehended within the orbit of the Earth, they would show all the same
phases with the Moon, present, sometimes their darkened, and sometimes their
enlightened sides to the Earth, and sometimes part of the one, and part of the other. He
answered, that they undoubtedly did all this; but that their smallness and distance
hindered us from perceiving it. This very bold assertion of Copernicus was confirmed by

demonstrated, more evidently than had been done, even by the observations of Tycho
Brahe, the revolutions of these two Planets round the Sun, as well as so far destroyed
the system of Ptolemy.
47
The mountains and seas, which, by the help of the same instrument, he discovered, or
imagined he had discovered in the Moon, rendering that Planet, in every respect, similar
to the Earth, made it seem less contrary to the analogy of nature, that, as the Moon
revolved round the Earth, the Earth should revolve round the Sun.
48
The spots which, in the same manner, he discovered in the Sun, demonstrating, by their
motion, the revolution of the Sun round his axis, made it seem less improbable that the
Earth, a body so much smaller than the Sun, should revolve round her axis in the same
manner.
49
Succeeding telescopical observations, discovered, in each of the Five Planets, spots not
unlike those which Galileo had observed in the Moon, and thereby seemed to
demonstrate what Copernicus had only conjectured, that the Planets were naturally
opaque, enlightened only by the rays of the Sun, habitable, diversified by seas and
mountains, and, in every respect, bodies of the same kind with the Earth; and thus
added one other probability to this system. By discovering, too, that each of the Planets
revolved round its own axis, at the same time that it was carried round either the Earth
or the Sun, they made it seem quite agreeable to the analogy of nature, that the Earth,
which, in every other respect, resembled the Planets, should, like them too, revolve
round its own axis, and at the same time perform its periodical motion round the Sun.
