{{< s v="90" >}} Specific institutions are necessary to facilitate specific branches of commerce. These require a specific and extraordinary costs.


{{< s v="91" >}} The commerce done with uncivilized nations needs extraordinary protection.

An ordinary counting-house gives little security to the goods of the merchants trading to the African west coast. Their warehouses should be fortified against the barbarous natives.

The Indian government's disorders rendered such fortifications necessary even among that mild and gentle people.


## Mercenaries and Negotiators versus Government Armies and Ministers

The English and French East India Companies were allowed to build their first forts in India under pretence of securing their persons and property from violence.

Other governments are vigorous enough to prevent foreigners from having any forts within their territory.

In such nations, it may be necessary to maintain an ambassador. He may judge cases between: 
<!-- decide, according to their own customs: -->
- <!-- the differences among  -->his own countrymen in that foreign land, and
- their disputes with the natives.

By his public character, he can:
- interfere with more authority, and
- better protect his countrymen, than any private man.

Commercial interests made it necessary to maintain ministers in foreign countries.
- The Turkey Company's commerce first established an ambassador at Constantinople.
- The first English embassies to Russia arose from commercial interests.

There was constant interference of commercial interests among the European states. It probably introduced the custom of keeping permanent ambassadors in neighbouring countries.

This custom was unknown in ancient times. It seems not older than the end of the 15th or the start of the 16th century when:
- commerce first extended itself to most European nations, and
- European nations first attended to commercial interests.



{{< s v="92" >}} The extraordinary cost of protecting any branch of commerce should be paid for by a moderate tax on that branch.

For example:
- a moderate fee paid by the traders when they first enter the trade, and
- a percentage duty on the goods they export or import to or from the country where protection is needed.
  - This tax is fairer <!-- more equal --> than the fee. <!-- moderate fine. -->

The protection from pirates <!-- and free-booters --> created the first customs duties.
- A general trade tax pays for the protection of the general trade
- A specific trade tax pays for the protection of that specific trade.


{{< s v="93" >}} The protection of general trade was always:
- essential to national defence and
- the executive power's duty.

The collection and use of the general customs duties was always left to the executive power. 

The protection of a specific trade is a part of the protection of the general trade. Therefore, it is a part of the executive power's duty. 

Both general and specific should always be left to the executive. 

However, in most European commercial countries, specific companies of merchants have lobbied <!-- persuaded --> the legislature to fully entrust this duty to them.

{{< s v="94" >}} These companies might have been useful to introduce some commerce by making an experiment at their own expence which the state did not think it prudent to make.

But in the long-run, those companies proved universally burdensome or useless by their mismanagement or confinement of the trade that they created.


## Private Regulated Companies Versus Joint Stock Companies

{{< s v="95" >}} Private regulated companies are companies which:
- do not <!-- trade --> do business on a joint stock of capital,
- are obliged to admit any qualified person who;
  - pays a fee <!-- certain fine, -->
  - agrees to submit to company regulations, and
  - has each member using <!-- trading on --> his own capital <!-- stock --> at his own risk.

Joint stock companies are companies which:
- do business <!-- trade --> on a joint stock of capital, and
- has each member sharing in the common profit or loss in proportion to his share in this stock

Regulated and joint stock companies sometimes have, sometimes do not have, exclusive privileges.


{{< s v="96" >}} Private regulated companies are enlarged monopolies that resemble guilds or the corporations of trades. Such guilds <!-- corporations --> are so common in all European cities. 

Private regulated companies | Corporation of Trades (Guilds)
--- | ---
A person must join a private regulated company to do foreign trade | A person must get approval from a guild before engaging in an incorporated profession <!--  business exercise an  trade -->

A company's monopoly is more or less strict:
- as the terms of admission are more or less difficult, and
- as the company executives <!-- directors --> have more or less power to confine the trade to themselves and their friends.

In the most ancient regulated companies, the privileges of apprenticeship were the same as in other corporations. Apprenticeships entitled the apprentice to become a member after serving his time to a member of the company:
- without paying any fee <!-- fine, --> or
- upon paying a much smaller fee.

"The usual corporation spirit, wherever the law does not restrain it, prevails in all regulated companies."

"When they have been allowed to act according to their natural genius, they have always, in order to confine the competition to as small a number of persons as possible, endeavoured to subject the trade to many burdensome regulations."

They have become altogether useless and insignificant when the law has restrained them from doing this.


{{< s v="97" >}} The private regulated companies for foreign commerce presently in Great Britain are:
- Hamburgh Company or the ancient merchant adventurers company
- The Russian Company
- The Eastland Company
- The Turkey Company
- The African Company of Merchants
