{{< s v="104" >}} Joint stock companies, established by royal charter or by act of parliament, differ from regulated companies and private copartneries.

{{< s v="105" >}} 1. In a private copartnery, no partner without the consent of the company can= 
- transfer his share to another person,
- introduce a new member into the company.

Upon proper warning, each member may= 
- withdraw from the copartnery, and
- demand payment for his share of the common stock from the copartnery.

In a joint stock company, on the contrary:

No member can demand payment for his share from the company.
Each member can, without the company's consent:
- transfer his share to another person, and
- introduce a new member.

The value of a share in a joint stock is always its market price. This is different from the stated value in the stock of the company.



{{< s v="106" >}} 2. In a private co-partnery, each partner is bound for the debts of the company to the extent of his fortune.

In a joint stock company, on the contrary, each partner is bound only to the extent of his share.



{{< s v="107" >}} The joint stock company's trade is always managed by a court of directors.

The court of directors is frequently subject to a court of proprietors.
But most of those proprietors seldom pretend to understand the company's business.
When the spirit of faction does not prevail among them, they give no trouble about it.
They are content to receive yearly dividends as the directors think proper to give to them.
This total exemption from trouble and risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies.
They would never hazard their fortunes in any private co-partnery.
Joint stock companies draw more stocks than any private co-partnery.

The South Sea Company's trading stock at one time amounted to more than £33,800,000.
The Bank of England's divided capital is presently £10,780,000.
The directors of such companies are the managers of other people's money.

They cannot be expected to watch over it with the same vigilance as the partners in a private co-partnery.
They are like the stewards of a rich man.
They think that attending to small matters are not for their master's honour.
They very easily exempt themselves from attending to such matters.
Negligence and profusion, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.

Joint stock companies for foreign trade seldom were able to compete against private adventurers.
They very seldom succeeded without an exclusive privilege.
They frequently have not succeeded even with an exclusive privilege.
Without an exclusive privilege they commonly mismanaged the trade.
With an exclusive privilege they both mismanaged and confined it.
