THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
RECALLING the decision of the Heads of State or Government, meeting within the European Council at Edinburgh on

HAVING NOTED the position of Denmark with regard to citizenship, economic and monetary union, defence policy,
and justice and home affairs as laid down in the Edinburgh decision;
CONSCIOUS of the fact that a continuation under the Constitution of the legal regime originating in the Edinburgh
decision will significantly limit Denmark's participation in important areas of cooperation of the Union, and that it
would be in the best interest of the Union to ensure the integrity of the acquis in the area of freedom, security and
justice;
WISHING therefore to establish a legal framework that will provide an option for Denmark to participate in the
adoption of measures proposed on the basis of Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Constitution and welcoming the
intention of Denmark to avail itself of this option when possible in accordance with its constitutional requirements;
NOTING that Denmark will not prevent the other Member States from further developing their cooperation with
respect to measures not binding on Denmark;
BEARING IN MIND the Protocol on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union,
HAVE AGREED UPON the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Constitution:
PART I

For the purposes of this Article, a qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members
of the Council representing the participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the
population of these States.

PROTOCOL CONCERNING IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION
OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS REFINED IN THE NETHERLANDS ANTILLES
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
BEING DESIROUS of giving fuller details about the system of trade applicable to imports into the Union of
petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles,
HAVE AGREED on the following provisions, which shall be annexed to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for
Europe:
Article 1
This Protocol is applicable to petroleum products coming under the Combined Nomenclature
headings 2710, 2711, 2712 (paraffin wax and petroleum wax), ex 2713 (paraffin residues) and 2714
(shale wax), imported for use in the Member States.
Article 2
Member States shall undertake to grant to petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles the
tariff preferences resulting from the Association of the latter with the Union, under the conditions
provided for by this Protocol. These provisions shall hold good whatever may be the rules of origin
applied by the Member States.
Article 3
1. When the Commission, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, establishes that
imports into the Union of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles under the system
provided for in Article 2 are giving rise to real difficulties on the market of one or more
Member States, it shall adopt a European decision establishing that customs duties on the said
imports shall be introduced, increased or reintroduced by the Member States in question, to such an
extent and for such a period as may be necessary to meet that situation. The rates of the customs
duties thus introduced, increased or reintroduced may not exceed the customs duties applicable to
third countries for these same products.
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 can in any case be applied when imports into the Union of
petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles reach two million tonnes a year.
3. The Council shall be informed of European decisions adopted by the Commission in pursuance
of paragraphs 1 and 2, including those directed at rejecting the request of a Member State.
The Council shall, at the request of any Member State, assume responsibility for the matter and may
at any time adopt a European decision to amend or revoke such decisions.954393_TRAITE_EN_351_400

Part IV
Article 4
1. If a Member State considers that imports of petroleum products refined in the
Netherlands Antilles, made either directly or through another Member State under the system
provided for in Article 2, are giving rise to real difficulties on its market and that immediate action is
necessary to meet them, it may on its own initiative decide to apply customs duties to such imports,
the rate of which may not exceed those of the customs duties applicable to third countries in respect
of the same products. It shall notify its decision to the Commission, which shall within one month
adopt a European decision establishing whether the measures taken by the State should be
maintained or must be amended or cancelled. Article 3(3) shall be applicable to such decision of the
Commission.
2. When the quantities of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles imported either
directly or through another Member State, under the system provided for in Article 2, into a
Member State or States exceed during a calendar year the tonnage shown in the Annex to this
Protocol, the measures taken in pursuance of paragraph 1 by that or those Member States for the
current year shall be considered to be justified. The Commission shall, after assuring itself that the
tonnage fixed has been reached, formally record the measures taken. In such a case the other
Member States shall abstain from formally placing the matter before the Council.
Article 5
If the Union decides to apply quantitative restrictions to petroleum products, no matter whence they
are imported, these restrictions may also be applied to imports of such products from the
Netherlands Antilles. In this case preferential treatment shall be granted to the Netherlands Antilles as
compared with third countries.
Article 6
1. Articles 2 to 5 may be reviewed by the Council, by unanimous decision, after consulting the
European Parliament and the Commission, when a common definition of origin for
petroleum products from third countries and associated countries is adopted, or when decisions
are taken within the framework of a common commercial policy for the products in question or
when a common energy policy is established.
2. When such revision is made, however, equivalent preferences shall in any case be maintained
in favour of the Netherlands Antilles in a suitable form and for a minimum quantity of 2 1/2 million
tonnes of petroleum products.
3. The Union's commitments in regard to equivalent preferences as referred to in paragraph 2 may,
if necessary, be broken down State by State taking into account the tonnage indicated in the Annex to
this Protocol.
Article 7
For the implementation of this Protocol, the Commission is responsible for following the pattern of
imports into the Member States of petroleum products refined in the Netherlands Antilles.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission, which shall see that it is circulated, all useful
information to that end in accordance with the administrative conditions recommended by it.954393_TRAITE_EN_351_400

DECLARATIONS CONCERNING PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION
1.
Declaration on Article I-6
The Conference notes that Article I-6 reflects existing case-law of the Court of Justice of the European
Communities and of the Court of First Instance.
2.
Declaration on Article I-9(2)
The Conference agrees that the Union's accession to the European Convention on the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms should be arranged in such a way as to preserve the
specific features of Union law. In this connection, the Conference notes the existence of a regular
dialogue between the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human
Rights; such dialogue could be reinforced when the Union accedes to that Convention.
3.
Declaration on Articles I-22, I-27 and I-28
In choosing the persons called upon to hold the offices of President of the European Council,
President of the Commission and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, due account is to be taken of the
need to respect the geographical and demographic diversity of the Union and its Member States.
4.
Declaration on Article I-24(7) concerning the European Council decision on the
exercise of the Presidency of the Council
The Conference declares that the Council should begin preparing the European decision establishing
the measures for applying the European decision of the European Council on the exercise of the
Presidency of the Council as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed and
should give its political approval within six months. A draft European decision of the European
Council, which will be adopted on the date of entry into force of the said Treaty, is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON THE EXERCISE OF THE PRESIDENCY
OF THE COUNCIL
Article 1
1. The Presidency of the Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration, shall be
held by pre-established groups of three Member States for a period of 18 months. The groups shall be
made up on a basis of equal rotation among the Member States, taking into account their diversity
and geographical balance within the Union.
2. Each member of the group shall in turn chair for a six-month period all configurations of the
Council, with the exception of the Foreign Affairs configuration. The other members of the group
shall assist the Chair in all its responsibilities on the basis of a common programme. Members of the
team may decide alternative arrangements among themselves.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

Article 2
The Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States shall be
chaired by a representative of the Member State chairing the General Affairs Council.
The Chair of the Political and Security Committee shall be held by a representative of the Union
Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The chair of the preparatory bodies of the various Council configurations, with the exception of the

configuration, unless decided otherwise in accordance with Article 4.
Article 3
The General Affairs Council shall ensure consistency and continuity in the work of the different
Council configurations in the framework of multiannual programmes in cooperation with the
Commission. The Member States holding the Presidency shall take all necessary measures for the
organisation and smooth operation of the Council's work, with the assistance of the General
Secretariat of the Council.
Article 4
The Council shall adopt a European decision establishing the measures for the implementation of this
decision.
5.
Declaration on Article I-25
The Conference declares that the European decision relating to the implementation of Article I-25
will be adopted by the Council on the day the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe enters
into force. The draft decision is set out below:
DRAFT EUROPEAN DECISION OF THE COUNCIL
RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE I-25
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Whereas:
(1) Provisions should be adopted allowing for a smooth transition from the system for decision-
making in the Council by a qualified majority as defined in the Treaty of Nice and set out in
Article 2(2) of the Protocol on the transitional provisions relating to the institutions and bodies
of the Union annexed to the Constitution, which will continue to apply until 31 October 2009,
to the voting system provided for in Article I-25 of the Constitution, which will apply with effect
from 1 November 2009.
(2) It is recalled that it is the practice of the Council to devote every effort to strengthening the
democratic legitimacy of decisions taken by a qualified majority.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

Final act
(3) It is judged appropriate to maintain this decision as long as is necessary to ensure smooth
transition to the new voting system provided for in the Constitution,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
If members of the Council, representing:
(a) at least three quarters of the population; or
(b) at least three quarters of the number of Member States.
necessary to constitute a blocking minority resulting from the application of Article I-25(1),
first subparagraph, or Article I-25(2), indicate their opposition to the Council adopting an act by
a qualified majority, the Council shall discuss the issue.
Article 2
The Council shall, in the course of these discussions, do all in its power to reach, within a reasonable
time and without prejudicing obligatory time limits laid down by Union law, a satisfactory solution to
address concerns raised by the members of the Council referred to in Article 1.
Article 3
To this end, the President of the Council, with the assistance of the Commission and in compliance
with the Rules of Procedure of the Council, shall undertake any initiative necessary to facilitate a
wider basis of agreement in the Council. The members of the Council shall lend him or her their
assistance.
Article 4
This decision shall take effect on 1 November 2009. It shall remain in force at least until 2014.
Thereafter the Council may adopt a European decision repealing it.
6.
Declaration on Article I-26
The Conference considers that when the Commission no longer includes nationals of all
Member States, the Commission should pay particular attention to the need to ensure full
transparency in relations with all Member States. Accordingly, the Commission should liaise closely
with all Member States, whether or not they have a national serving as member of the Commission,
and in this context pay special attention to the need to share information and consult with all
Member States.
The Conference also considers that the Commission should take all the necessary measures to ensure
that political, social and economic realities in all Member States, including those which have no954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

431
national serving as member of the Commission, are fully taken into account. These measures should
include ensuring that the position of those Member States is addressed by appropriate organisational
arrangements.
7.
Declaration on Article I-27
The Conference considers that, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the European
Parliament and the European Council are jointly responsible for the smooth running of the process
leading to the election of the President of the European Commission. Prior to the decision of the
European Council, representatives of the European Parliament and of the European Council will thus
conduct the necessary consultations in the framework deemed the most appropriate. These
consultations will focus on the backgrounds of the candidates for President of the Commission,
taking account of the elections to the European Parliament, in accordance with Article I-27(1). The
arrangements for such consultations may be determined, in due course, by common accord between
the European Parliament and the European Council.
8.
Declaration on Article I-36
The Conference takes note of the Commission's intention to continue to consult experts appointed
by the Member States in the preparation of draft delegated European regulations in the financial
services area, in accordance with its established practice.
9.
Declaration on Articles I-43 and III-329
Without prejudice to the measures adopted by the Union to comply with its solidarity obligation
towards a Member State which is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of natural or man-made
disaster, none of the provisions of Articles I-43 and III-329 of the Constitution is intended to affect
the right of another Member State to choose the most appropriate means to comply with its own
solidarity obligation towards that Member State.
10.
Declaration on Article I-51
The Conference declares that, whenever rules on protection of personal data to be adopted on the
basis of Article I-51 could have direct implications for national security, due account will have to be
taken of the specific characteristics of the matter. It recalls that the legislation presently applicable (see
in particular Directive 95/46/EC) includes specific derogations in this regard.
11.
Declaration on Article I-57
The Union will take into account the particular situation of small-sized countries which maintain
specific relations of proximity with it.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

12. Declaration concerning the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
The Conference takes note of the explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights
prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and
updated under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, as set out below.
EXPLANATIONS RELATING TO THE CHARTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
These explanations were originally prepared under the authority of the Praesidium of the Convention
which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. They have been updated
under the responsibility of the Praesidium of the European Convention, in the light of the drafting
adjustments made to the text of the Charter by that Convention (notably to Articles 51 and 52 ( 1 ))
and of further developments of Union law. Although they do not as such have the status of law, they
are a valuable tool of interpretation intended to clarify the provisions of the Charter.
PREAMBLE
The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union among them, are resolved to share a peaceful
future based on common values.
Conscious of its spiritual and moral heritage, the Union is founded on the indivisible, universal values
of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity; it is based on the principles of democracy and the
rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities, by establishing the citizenship of the
Union and by creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Union contributes to the preservation and to the development of these common values while
respecting the diversity of the cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe as well as the national
identities of the Member States and the organisation of their public authorities at national, regional
and local levels; it seeks to promote balanced and sustainable development and ensures free
movement of persons, services, goods and capital, and the freedom of establishment.
To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights in the light of changes
in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments by making those rights more
visible in a Charter.
This Charter reaffirms, with due regard for the powers and tasks of the Union and the principle of
subsidiarity, the rights as they result, in particular, from the constitutional traditions and international
obligations common to the Member States, the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Social Charters adopted by the Union and by the
Council of Europe and the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of the
European Court of Human Rights. In this context the Charter will be interpreted by the courts of the
Union and the Member States with due regard to the explanations prepared under the authority of
the Praesidium of the Convention which drafted the Charter and updated under the responsibility of

the Praesidium of the European Convention.
Enjoyment of these rights entails responsibilities and duties with regard to other persons, to the
human community and to future generations.
The Union therefore recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out hereafter.
TITLE I
DIGNITY
Article 1 ( 1 )
Human dignity
Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.
Explanation
The dignity of the human person is not only a fundamental right in itself but constitutes the real basis of fundamental
rights. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrined human dignity in its preamble: ‘Whereas
recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.’ In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98
Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR 7079, at grounds 70 to 77, the Court of Justice confirmed
that a fundamental right to human dignity is part of Union law.
It results that none of the rights laid down in this Charter may be used to harm the dignity of another person, and that
the dignity of the human person is part of the substance of the rights laid down in this Charter. It must therefore be
respected, even where a right is restricted.
Article 2 ( 2 )
Right to life
1. Everyone has the right to life.
2. No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.
Explanation
1.
Paragraph 1 of this Article is based on the first sentence of Article 2(1) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law…’
( 1 ) Article II-61 of the Constitution.
( 2 ) Article II-62 of the Constitution.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

2.
Final act
The second sentence of the provision, which referred to the death penalty, was superseded by the entry into force
of Article 1 of Protocol No 6 to the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘The death penalty shall be abolished. No-one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed.’
Article 2(2) of the Charter ( 1 ) is based on that provision.
3.
The provisions of Article 2 of the Charter ( 2 ) correspond to those of the above Articles of the ECHR and its
Protocol. They have the same meaning and the same scope, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 3 ).
Therefore, the ‘negative’ definitions appearing in the ECHR must be regarded as also forming part of the Charter:
(a) Article 2(2) of the ECHR:
‘Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the
use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:
(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;
(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.’
(b) Article 2 of Protocol 6 to the ECHR:
‘A State may make provision in its law for the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of
imminent threat of war; such penalty shall be applied only in the instances laid down in the law and in
accordance with its provisions…’
Article 3 ( 4 )
Right to the integrity of the person
1. Everyone has the right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity.
2. In the fields of medicine and biology, the following must be respected in particular:
(a) the free and informed consent of the person concerned, according to the procedures laid down
by law;
(b) the prohibition of eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons;
( 1 ) Article II-62(2) of the Constitution.
( 2 ) Article II-62 of the Constitution.
( 3 ) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
( 4 ) Article II-63 of the Constitution.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450
13-01-2005
08:14
Pagina 435
Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe
435
(c) the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain;
(d) the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of human beings.
Explanation
1. In its judgment of 9 October 2001 in case C-377/98 Netherlands v European Parliament and Council [2001] ECR
7079, at grounds 70, 78 to 80, the Court of Justice confirmed that a fundamental right to human integrity is part
of Union law and encompasses, in the context of medicine and biology, the free and informed consent of the donor
and recipient.
2. The principles of Article 3 of the Charter ( 1 ) are already included in the Convention on Human Rights and
Biomedicine, adopted by the Council of Europe (ETS 164 and additional protocol ETS 168). The Charter does not
set out to depart from those principles, and therefore prohibits only reproductive cloning. It neither authorises nor
prohibits other forms of cloning. Thus it does not in any way prevent the legislature from prohibiting other forms
of cloning.
3. The reference to eugenic practices, in particular those aiming at the selection of persons, relates to possible
situations in which selection programmes are organised and implemented, involving campaigns for sterilisation,
forced pregnancy, compulsory ethnic marriage among others, all acts deemed to be international crimes in the
Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted in Rome on 17 July 1998 (see its Article 7(1)(g)).
Article 4 ( 2 )
Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
Explanation
The right in Article 4 ( 2 ) is the right guaranteed by Article 3 of the ECHR, which has the same wording: ‘No one shall be
subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’. By virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 3 ),
it therefore has the same meaning and the same scope as the ECHR Article.
Article 5 ( 4 )
Prohibition of slavery and forced labour
1. No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.
( 1 ) Article II-63 of the Constitution.
( 2 ) Article II-64 of the Constitution.
( 3 ) Article II-112(3) of the Constitution.
( 4 ) Article II-65 of the Constitution.954393_TRAITE_EN_400_450

Pagina 436
436
Final act
2. No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.
3. Trafficking in human beings is prohibited.
Explanation
1.
The right in Article 5(1) and (2) ( 1 ) corresponds to Article 4(1) and (2) of the ECHR, which has the same wording. It
therefore has the same meaning and scope as the ECHR Article, by virtue of Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 2 ).
Consequently:
— no limitation may legitimately affect the right provided for in paragraph 1;
— in paragraph 2, ‘forced or compulsory labour’ must be understood in the light of the ‘negative’ definitions
contained in Article 4(3) of the ECHR:
‘For the purpose of this article the term “forced or compulsory labour” shall not include:
(a) any work required to be done in the ordinary course of detention imposed according to the provisions of
Article 5 of this Convention or during conditional release from such detention;
(b) any service of a military character or, in case of conscientious objectors in countries where they are
recognised, service exacted instead of compulsory military service;
(c) any service exacted in case of an emergency or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the
community;
(d) any work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations.’
2. Paragraph 3 stems directly from human dignity and takes account of recent developments in organised crime, such
as the organisation of lucrative illegal immigration or sexual exploitation networks. The Annex to the Europol
Convention contains the following definition which refers to trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation:
‘traffic in human beings: means subjection of a person to the real and illegal sway of other persons by using
violence or menaces or by abuse of authority or intrigue with a view to the exploitation of prostitution, forms of
sexual exploitation and assault of minors or trade in abandoned children’. Chapter VI of the Convention
implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has been integrated into the Union's acquis, in which the United
Kingdom and Ireland participate, contains the following wording in Article 27(1) which refers to illegal
immigration networks: ‘The Contracting Parties undertake to impose appropriate penalties on any person who, for
financial gain, assists or tries to assist an alien to enter or reside within the territory of one of the Contracting
Parties in breach of that Contracting Party's laws on the entry and residence of aliens.’ On 19 July 2002, the
Council adopted a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings (OJ L 203/1) whose Article 1
defines in detail the offences concerning trafficking in human beings for the purposes of labour exploitation or
sexual exploitation, which the Member States must make punishable by virtue of that framework decision.

TITLE II
FREEDOMS
Article 6 ( 1 )
Right to liberty and security
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.
Explanation
The rights in Article 6 ( 1 ) are the rights guaranteed by Article 5 of the ECHR, and in accordance with Article 52(3) of
the Charter ( 2 ), they have the same meaning and scope. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be
imposed on them may not exceed those permitted by the ECHR, in the wording of Article 5:
‘1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the
following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:
(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;
(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to
secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;
(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal
authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered
necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;
(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for
the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;
(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of
unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;
(f)
the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of
a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.
2. Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his
arrest and of any charge against him.
3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1(c) of this Article shall be brought
promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial
within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.

Final act
4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the
lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.
5. Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall
have an enforceable right to compensation.’
The rights enshrined in Article 6 ( 1 ) must be respected particularly when the European Parliament
and the Council adopt laws and framework laws in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal
matters, on the basis of Articles III-270, III-271 and III-273 of the Constitution, notably to define
common minimum provisions as regards the categorisation of offences and punishments and certain
aspects of procedural law.
Article 7 ( 2 )
Respect for private and family life
Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life, home and communications.
Explanation
The rights guaranteed in Article 7 ( 2 ) correspond to those guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR. To take account of
developments in technology the word ‘correspondence’ has been replaced by ‘communications’.
In accordance with Article 52(3) ( 3 ), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those of the corresponding
article of the ECHR. Consequently, the limitations which may legitimately be imposed on this right are the same as
those allowed by Article 8 of the ECHR:
‘1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance
with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,
or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’

Article 8 ( 1 )
Protection of personal data
1.
Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the
person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
3.
Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 286 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Directive 95/46/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995) as well as on Article 8 of the ECHR and on
the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic
Processing of Personal Data, which has been ratified by all the Member States. Article 286 of the EC Treaty is now
replaced by Article I-51 of the Constitution. Reference is also made to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the
Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001). The abovementioned
Directive and Regulation contain conditions and limitations for the exercise of the right to the protection of personal
data.
Article 9 ( 2 )
Right to marry and right to found a family
The right to marry and the right to found a family shall be guaranteed in accordance with the
national laws governing the exercise of these rights.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 12 of the ECHR, which reads as follows: ‘Men and women of marriageable age have the
right to marry and to found a family according to the national laws governing the exercising of this right.’ The wording
of the Article has been modernised to cover cases in which national legislation recognises arrangements other than
marriage for founding a family. This Article neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of the status of marriage to
unions between people of the same sex. This right is thus similar to that afforded by the ECHR, but its scope may be
wider when national legislation so provides.

Article 10 ( 1 )
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right includes
freedom to change religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in
public or in private, to manifest religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.
2. The right to conscientious objection is recognised, in accordance with the national laws
governing the exercise of this right.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in paragraph 1 corresponds to the right guaranteed in Article 9 of the ECHR and, in accordance
with Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 2 ), has the same meaning and scope. Limitations must therefore respect Article 9(2) of
the Convention, which reads as follows: ‘Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such
limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the
protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.’
The right guaranteed in paragraph 2 corresponds to national constitutional traditions and to the development of
national legislation on this issue.
Article 11 ( 3 )
Freedom of expression and information
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold
opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority
and regardless of frontiers.
2.
The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.
Explanation
1. Article 11 ( 3 ) corresponds to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which reads as follows:

The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities,
conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the
interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure
of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.’
Pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 1 ), the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those guaranteed by the
ECHR. The limitations which may be imposed on it may therefore not exceed those provided for in Article 10(2) of the
Convention, without prejudice to any restrictions which competition law of the Union may impose on Member States'
right to introduce the licensing arrangements referred to in the third sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECHR.
2. Paragraph 2 of this Article spells out the consequences of paragraph 1 regarding freedom of the media. It is based
in particular on Court of Justice case-law regarding television, particularly in case C-288/89 (judgment of 25 July 1991,
Stichting Collectieve Antennevoorziening Gouda and others [1991] ECR I-4007), and on the Protocol on the system of
public broadcasting in the Member States annexed to the EC Treaty and now to the Constitution, and on Council
Directive 89/552/EC (particularly its seventeenth recital).
Article 12 ( 2 )
Freedom of assembly and of association
1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association at all
levels, in particular in political, trade union and civic matters, which implies the right of everyone to
form and to join trade unions for the protection of his or her interests.
2. Political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the
Union.
Explanation
1. Paragraph 1 of this Article corresponds to Article 11 of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the
right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.
2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder
or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This
article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the
armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.’

Final act
The meaning of the provisions of paragraph 1 is the same as that of the ECHR, but their scope is wider since they apply
at all levels including European level. In accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter ( 1 ), limitations on that right may
not exceed those considered legitimate by virtue of Article 11(2) of the ECHR.
2. This right is also based on Article 11 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social
Rights of Workers.
3.
Paragraph 2 of this Article corresponds to Article I-46(4) of the Constitution.
Article 13 ( 2 )
Freedom of the arts and sciences
The arts and scientific research shall be free of constraint. Academic freedom shall be respected.
Explanation
This right is deduced primarily from the right to freedom of thought and expression. It is to be exercised having regard
to Article 1 ( 3 ) and may be subject to the limitations authorised by Article 10 of the ECHR.
Article 14 ( 4 )
Right to education
1. Everyone has the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training.
2. This right includes the possibility to receive free compulsory education.
3. The freedom to found educational establishments with due respect for democratic principles and
the right of parents to ensure the education and teaching of their children in conformity with their
religious, philosophical and pedagogical convictions shall be respected, in accordance with the
national laws governing the exercise of such freedom and right.
Explanation
1.
This Article is based on the common constitutional traditions of Member States and on Article 2 of the Protocol to
the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘No person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to
education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching in
conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.’

It was considered useful to extend this article to access to vocational and continuing training (see point 15 of the
Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and Article 10 of the Social Charter) and to add
the principle of free compulsory education. As it is worded, the latter principle merely implies that as regards
compulsory education, each child has the possibility of attending an establishment which offers free education. It
does not require all establishments which provide education or vocational and continuing training, in particular
private ones, to be free of charge. Nor does it exclude certain specific forms of education having to be paid for, if
the State takes measures to grant financial compensation. Insofar as the Charter applies to the Union, this means
that in its training policies the Union must respect free compulsory education, but this does not, of course, create
new powers. Regarding the right of parents, it must be interpreted in conjunction with the provisions of
Article 24 ( 1 ).
2.
Freedom to found public or private educational establishments is guaranteed as one of the aspects of freedom to
conduct a business but it is limited by respect for democratic principles and is exercised in accordance with the
arrangements defined by national legislation.
Article 15 ( 2 )
Freedom to choose an occupation and right to engage in work
1.
Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation.
2. Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of
establishment and to provide services in any Member State.
3. Nationals of third countries who are authorised to work in the territories of the Member States
are entitled to working conditions equivalent to those of citizens of the Union.
Explanation
Freedom to choose an occupation, as enshrined in Article 15(1) ( 2 ), is recognised in Court of Justice case-law (see inter
alia judgment of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraphs 12 to 14 of the grounds; judgment of
13 December 1979, Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 8 October 1986, Case 234/85 Keller [1986]
ECR 2897, paragraph 8 of the grounds).
This paragraph also draws upon Article 1(2) of the European Social Charter, which was signed on 18 October 1961 and
has been ratified by all the Member States, and on point 4 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights
of Workers of 9 December 1989. The expression ‘working conditions’ is to be understood in the sense of Article III-213
of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 deals with the three freedoms guaranteed by Articles I-4 and III-133, III-137 and III-144 of the
Constitution, namely freedom of movement for workers, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
Paragraph 3 has been based on TEC Article 137(3), fourth indent, now replaced by Article III-210(1)(g) of the
Constitution, and on Article 19(4) of the European Social Charter signed on 18 October 1961 and ratified by all the
( 1 ) Article II-84 of the Constitution.

Member States. Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ) is therefore applicable. The question of recruitment of seamen having the
nationality of third States for the crews of vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the Union is governed by Union
law and national legislation and practice.
Article 16 ( 2 )
Freedom to conduct a business
The freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices is
recognised.
Explanation
This Article is based on Court of Justice case-law which has recognised freedom to exercise an economic or commercial
activity (see judgments of 14 May 1974, Case 4/73 Nold [1974] ECR 491, paragraph 14 of the grounds, and of
27 September 1979, Case 230-78 SPA Eridiana and others [1979] ECR 2749, paragraphs 20 and 31 of the grounds) and
freedom of contract (see inter alia Sukkerfabriken Nykøbing judgment, Case 151/78 [1979] ECR 1, paragraph 19 of the
grounds, and judgment of 5 October 1999, C-240/97 Spain v Commission, [1999] ECR I-6571, paragraph 99 of the
grounds) and Article I-3(2) of the Constitution, which recognises free competition. Of course, this right is to be
exercised with respect for Union law and national legislation. It may be subject to the limitations provided for in
Article 52(1) of the Charter ( 3 ).
Article 17 ( 4 )
Right to property
1. Everyone has the right to own, use, dispose of and bequeath his or her lawfully acquired
possessions. No one may be deprived of his or her possessions, except in the public interest and in
the cases and under the conditions provided for by law, subject to fair compensation being paid in
good time for their loss. The use of property may be regulated by law insofar as is necessary for the
general interest.
2.
Intellectual property shall be protected.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 1 of the Protocol to the ECHR:
‘Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his
possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles
of international law.
The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems
necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or
other contributions or penalties.’

This is a fundamental right common to all national constitutions. It has been recognised on numerous occasions by the
case-law of the Court of Justice, initially in the Hauer judgment (13 December 1979, ECR [1979] 3727). The wording
has been updated but, in accordance with Article 52(3) ( 1 ), the meaning and scope of the right are the same as those of
the right guaranteed by the ECHR and the limitations may not exceed those provided for there.
Protection of intellectual property, one aspect of the right of property, is explicitly mentioned in paragraph 2 because of
its growing importance and Community secondary legislation. Intellectual property covers not only literary and artistic
property but also inter alia patent and trademark rights and associated rights. The guarantees laid down in paragraph 1
shall apply as appropriate to intellectual property.
Article 18 ( 2 )
Right to asylum
The right to asylum shall be guaranteed with due respect for the rules of the Geneva Convention of
28 July 1951 and the Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of refugees and in accordance
with the Constitution.
Explanation
The text of the Article has been based on TEC Article 63, now replaced by Article III-266 of the Constitution, which
requires the Union to respect the Geneva Convention on refugees. Reference should be made to the Protocols relating to
the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the [Treaty of Amsterdam] Constitution and to Denmark to determine the
extent to which those Member States implement Union law in this area and the extent to which this Article is applicable
to them. This Article is in line with the Protocol on Asylum annexed to the Constitution.
Article 19 ( 3 )
Protection in the event of removal, expulsion or extradition
1.
Collective expulsions are prohibited.
2. No one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or
she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or
punishment.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 of this Article has the same meaning and scope as Article 4 of Protocol 4 to the ECHR concerning
collective expulsion. Its purpose is to guarantee that every decision is based on a specific examination and that no single
measure can be taken to expel all persons having the nationality of a particular State (see also Article 13 of the Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights).
Paragraph 2 incorporates the relevant case-law from the European Court of Human Rights regarding Article 3 of the
ECHR (see Ahmed v Austria, judgment of 17 December 1996, [1996] ECR VI-2206 and Soering, judgment of 7 July
1989).

TITLE III
EQUALITY
Article 20 ( 1 )
Equality before the law
Everyone is equal before the law.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to a general principle of law which is included in all European constitutions and has also been
recognised by the Court of Justice as a basic principle of Community law (judgment of 13 November 1984, Case 283/
83 Racke [1984] ECR 3791, judgment of 17 April 1997, Case 15/95 EARL [1997] ECR I-1961, and judgment of
13 April 2000, Case 292/97 Karlsson [2000] ECR 2737).
Article 21 ( 2 )
Non-discrimination
1. Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic
features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national
minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.
2. Within the scope of application of the Constitution and without prejudice to any of its specific
provisions, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.
Explanation
Paragraph 1 draws on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-124 of the Constitution, Article 14 of the
ECHR and Article 11 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine as regards genetic heritage. Insofar as this
corresponds to Article 14 of the ECHR, it applies in compliance with it.
There is no contradiction or incompatibility between paragraph 1 and Article III-124 of the Constitution which has a
different scope and purpose: Article III-124 confers power on the Union to adopt legislative acts, including
harmonisation of the Member States' laws and regulations, to combat certain forms of discrimination, listed
exhaustively in that Article. Such legislation may cover action of Member State authorities (as well as relations between
private individuals) in any area within the limits of the Union's powers. In contrast, the provision in paragraph 1 does
not create any power to enact anti-discrimination laws in these areas of Member State or private action, nor does it lay
down a sweeping ban of discrimination in such wide-ranging areas. Instead, it only addresses discriminations by the
institutions and bodies of the Union themselves, when exercising powers conferred under other articles of Parts I and III
( 1 ) Article II-80 of the Constitution.

of the Constitution, and by Member States only when they are implementing Union law. Paragraph 1 therefore does not
alter the extent of powers granted under Article III-124 nor the interpretation given to that Article.
Paragraph 2 corresponds to Article I-4(2) of the Constitution and must be applied in compliance with that Article.
Article 22 ( 1 )
Cultural, religious and linguistic diversity
The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity.
Explanation
This Article has been based on Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and on Article 151(1) and (4) of the EC
Treaty, now replaced by Article III-280(1) and (4) of the Constitution, concerning culture. Respect for cultural and
linguistic diversity is now also laid down in Article I-3(3) of the Constitution. The Article is also inspired by Declaration
No 11 to the Final Act of the Amsterdam Treaty on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations, now
taken over in Article I-52 of the Constitution.
Article 23 ( 2 )
Equality between women and men
Equality between women and men must be ensured in all areas, including employment, work and
pay.
The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for
specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.
Explanation
The first paragraph has been based on Articles 2 and 3(2) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles I-3 and III-116 of
the Constitution which impose the objective of promoting equality between men and women on the Union, and on
Article 141(1) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(1) of the Constitution. It draws on Article 20 of the
revised European Social Charter of 3 May 1996 and on point 16 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
It is also based on Article 141(3) of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article III-214(3) of the Constitution, and Article 2
(4) of Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as
regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
The second paragraph takes over in shorter form Article III-214(4) of the Constitution which provides that the principle
of equal treatment does not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in order
to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for

disadvantages in professional careers. In accordance with Article 52(2) ( 1 ), the present paragraph does not amend
Article III-214(4).
Article 24 ( 2 )
The rights of the child
1. Children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being. They
may express their views freely. Such views shall be taken into consideration on matters which
concern them in accordance with their age and maturity.
2. In all actions relating to children, whether taken by public authorities or private institutions, the
child's best interests must be a primary consideration.
3. Every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct
contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests.
Explanation
This Article is based on the New York Convention on the Rights of the Child signed on 20 November 1989 and ratified
by all the Member States, particularly Articles 3, 9, 12 and 13 thereof.
Paragraph 3 takes account of the fact that, as part of the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, Union
legislation on civil matters having cross-border implications, for which Article III-269 of the Constitution confers
power, may include notably visiting rights ensuring that children can maintain on a regular basis a personal and direct
contact with both his or her parents.
Article 25 ( 3 )
The rights of the elderly
The Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence
and to participate in social and cultural life.
Explanation
This Article draws on Article 23 of the revised European Social Charter and Articles 24 and 25 of the Community
Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers. Of course, participation in social and cultural life also covers
participation in political life.
( 1 ) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.
( 2 ) Article II-84 of the Constitution.
( 3 ) Article II-85 of the Constitution.

Article 26 ( 1 )

Integration of persons with disabilities
The Union recognises and respects the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures
designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the
life of the community.
Explanation

The principle set out in this Article is based on Article 15 of the European Social Charter and also draws on point 26 of
the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.

TITLE IV
SOLIDARITY
Article 27 ( 2 )
Workers' right to information and consultation within the undertaking
Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and
consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Union law and
national laws and practices.
Explanation
This Article appears in the revised European Social Charter (Article 21) and in the Community Charter on the rights of
workers (points 17 and 18). It applies under the conditions laid down by Union law and by national laws. The reference
to appropriate levels refers to the levels laid down by Union law or by national laws and practices, which might include
the European level when Union legislation so provides. There is a considerable Union acquis in this field: Articles III-211
and III-212 of the Constitution, and Directives 2002/14/EC (general framework for informing and consulting employees
in the European Community), 98/59/EC (collective redundancies), 2001/23/EC (transfers of undertakings) and
94/45/EC (European works councils).
Article 28 ( 3 )
Right of collective bargaining and action
Workers and employers, or their respective organisations, have, in accordance with Union law and
national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the
appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their
interests, including strike action.

Explanation
This Article is based on Article 6 of the European Social Charter and on the Community Charter of the Fundamental
Social Rights of Workers (points 12 to 14). The right of collective action was recognised by the European Court of
Human Rights as one of the elements of trade union rights laid down by Article 11 of the ECHR. As regards the
appropriate levels at which collective negotiation might take place, see the explanation given for the above Article. The
modalities and limits for the exercise of collective action, including strike action, come under national laws and
practices, including the question of whether it may be carried out in parallel in several Member States.
Article 29 ( 1 )
Right of access to placement services
Everyone has the right of access to a free placement service.
Explanation
This Article is based on Article 1(3) of the European Social Charter and point 13 of the Community Charter of the
Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
Article 30 ( 2 )
Protection in the event of unjustified dismissal
Every worker has the right to protection against unjustified dismissal, in accordance with Union law
and national laws and practices.
Explanation
This Article draws on Article 24 of the revised Social Charter. See also Directive 2001/23/EC on the safeguarding of
employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, and Directive 80/987/EEC on the protection of employees in
the event of the insolvency of their employer, as amended by Directive 2002/74/EC.

Explanation
1. Paragraph 1 of this Article is based on Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage
improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. It also draws on Article 3 of the Social Charter and point 19
of the Community Charter on the rights of workers, and, as regards dignity at work, on Article 26 of the revised Social
Charter. The expression ‘working conditions’ must be understood in the sense of Article III-213 of the Constitution.
2. Paragraph 2 is based on Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time,
Article 2 of the European Social Charter and point 8 of the Community Charter on the rights of workers.
Article 32 ( 1 )
Prohibition of child labour and protection of young people at work
The employment of children is prohibited. The minimum age of admission to employment may not
be lower than the minimum school-leaving age, without prejudice to such rules as may be more
favourable to young people and except for limited derogations.
Young people admitted to work must have working conditions appropriate to their age and be
protected against economic exploitation and any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical,
mental, moral or social development or to interfere with their education.
Explanation
This Article is based on Directive 94/33/EC on the protection of young people at work, Article 7 of the European Social
Charter and points 20 to 23 of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers.
Article 33 ( 2 )
Family and professional life
1.
The family shall enjoy legal, economic and social protection.
2. To reconcile family and professional life, everyone shall have the right to protection from
dismissal for a reason connected with maternity and the right to paid maternity leave and to parental
leave following the birth or adoption of a child.
Explanation
Article 33(1) ( 2 ) is based on Article 16 of the European Social Charter.

The second paragraph draws on Council Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage
improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are
breastfeeding and Directive 96/34/EC on the framework agreement on parental leave concluded by UNICE, CEEP and
the ETUC. It is also based on Article 8 (protection of maternity) of the European Social Charter and draws on Article 27
(right of workers with family responsibilities to equal opportunities and equal treatment) of the revised Social Charter.
‘Maternity’ covers the period from conception to weaning.
Article 34 ( 1 )
Social security and social assistance
1. The Union recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services
providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age,
and in the case of loss of employment, in accordance with the rules laid down by Union law and
national laws and practices.
2. Everyone residing and moving legally within the European Union is entitled to social security
benefits and social advantages in accordance with Union law and national laws and practices.
3. In order to combat social exclusion and poverty, the Union recognises and respects the right to
social and housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence for all those who lack sufficient
resources, in accordance with the rules laid down by Union law and national laws and practices.
Explanation
The principle set out in Article 34(1) ( 1 ) is based on Articles 137 and 140 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Articles III-
210 and III-213 and on Article 12 of the European Social Charter and point 10 of the Community Charter on the rights
of workers. The Union must respect it when exercising the powers conferred on it by Articles III-210 and III-213 of the
Constitution. The reference to social services relates to cases in which such services have been introduced to provide
certain advantages but does not imply that such services must be created where they do not exist. ‘Maternity’ must be
understood in the same sense as in the preceding Article.
Paragraph 2 is based on Articles 12(4) and 13(4) of the European Social Charter and point 2 of the Community Charter
of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers and reflects the rules arising from Regulation No 1408/71 and Regulation
No 1612/68.
Paragraph 3 draws on Article 13 of the European Social Charter and Articles 30 and 31 of the revised Social Charter
and point 10 of the Community Charter. The Union must respect it in the context of policies based on Article III-210 of
the Constitution.

Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical

Explanation
This Article corresponds to the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2) of the Constitution (see also the legal base in
Article III-126 for the adoption of detailed arrangements for the exercise of that right). In accordance with Article 52(2)
of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions set out in these Articles of Parts I and III of the Constitution.
Article 41 ( 2 )
Right to good administration
1. Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a
reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union.
2.
This right includes:
(a) the right of every person to be heard, before any individual measure which would affect him or
her adversely is taken;
(b) the right of every person to have access to his or her file, while respecting the legitimate interests
of confidentiality and of professional and business secrecy;
(c) the obligation of the administration to give reasons for its decisions.
3. Every person has the right to have the Union make good any damage caused by its institutions or
by its servants in the performance of their duties, in accordance with the general principles common
to the laws of the Member States.
4. Every person may write to the institutions of the Union in one of the languages of
the Constitution and must have an answer in the same language.
Explanation
Article 41 ( 2 ) is based on the existence of the Union as subject to the rule of law whose characteristics were developed in
the case-law which enshrined, inter alia, good administration as a general principle of law (see, inter alia, Court of Justice
judgment of 31 March 1992 in Case C-255/90 P, Burban [1992] ECR I-2253, and Court of First Instance judgments of
18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-2589, and 9 July 1999 in Case T-231/97 New Europe
Consulting and others [1999] ECR II-2403). The wording for that right in the first two paragraphs results from the case-
law (Court of Justice judgment of 15 October 1987 in Case 222/86 Heylens [1987] ECR 4097, paragraph 15 of the
grounds, judgment of 18 October 1989 in Case 374/87 Orkem [1989] ECR 3283, judgment of 21 November 1991 in
Case C-269/90 TU München [1991] ECR I-5469, and Court of First Instance judgments of 6 December 1994 in Case T-
450/93 Lisrestal [1994] ECR II-1177, 18 September 1995 in Case T-167/94 Nölle [1995] ECR II-258) and the wording
regarding the obligation to give reasons comes from Article 253 of the EC Treaty, now replaced by Article I-38(2) of the
Constitution (see also the legal base in Article III-398 of the Constitution for the adoption of legislation in the interest
of an open, efficient and independent European administration).

Paragraph 3 reproduces the right now guaranteed by Article III-431 of the Constitution. Paragraph 4 reproduces the
right now guaranteed by Articles I-10(2)(d) and III-129 of the Constitution. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the
Charter ( 1 ), those rights are to be applied under the conditions and within the limits defined by Part III of the
Constitution.
The right to an effective remedy, which is an important aspect of this question, is guaranteed in Article 47 of this
Charter ( 2 ).
Article 42 ( 3 )
Right of access to documents
Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State, has a right of access to documents of the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of
the Union, whatever their medium.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article has been taken over from Article 255 of the EC Treaty, on the basis of which
Regulation 1049/2001 has subsequently been adopted. The European Convention has extended this right to documents
of institutions, bodies and agencies generally, regardless of their form, see Article I-50(3) of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), the right of access to documents is exercised under the conditions and
within the limits for which provision is made in Articles I-50(3) and III-399.
Article 43 ( 4 )
European Ombudsman
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State has the right to refer to the European Ombudsman cases of maladministration in the
activities of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union, with the exception of the Court
of Justice of the European Union acting in its judicial role.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article is the right guaranteed by Articles I-10 and III-335 of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these two Articles.
( 1 ) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.

Article 44 ( 1 )
Right to petition
Any citizen of the Union and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a
Member State has the right to petition the European Parliament.
Explanation
The right guaranteed in this Article is the right guaranteed by Articles I-10 and III-334 of the Constitution. In
accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 2 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these two Articles.
Article 45 ( 3 )
Freedom of movement and of residence
1. Every citizen of the Union has the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the
Member States.
2. Freedom of movement and residence may be granted, in accordance with the Constitution, to
nationals of third countries legally resident in the territory of a Member State.
Explanation
The right guaranteed by paragraph 1 is the right guaranteed by Article I-10(2)(a) of the Constitution (cf. also the legal
base in Article III-125; and the judgement of the Court of Justice of 17 September 2002, C-413/99 Baumbast, [2002]
ECR 709). In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 2 ), it applies under the conditions and within the limits
defined for which provision is made in Part III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 2 refers to the power granted to the Union by Articles III-265 to III-267 of the Constitution. Consequently,
the granting of this right depends on the institutions exercising that power.
Article 46 ( 4 )
Diplomatic and consular protection
Every citizen of the Union shall, in the territory of a third country in which the Member State of
which he or she is a national is not represented, be entitled to protection by the diplomatic or
consular authorities of any Member State, on the same conditions as the nationals of that
Member State.

Explanation
The right guaranteed by this Article is the right guaranteed by Article I-10 of the Constitution; cf. also the legal base in
Article III-127. In accordance with Article 52(2) of the Charter ( 1 ), it applies under the conditions defined in these
Articles.
TITLE VI
JUSTICE
Article 47 ( 2 )
Right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial
Everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by the law of the Union are violated has the right to
an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in this Article.
Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and
impartial tribunal previously established by law. Everyone shall have the possibility of being advised,
defended and represented.
Legal aid shall be made available to those who lack sufficient resources insofar as such aid is necessary
to ensure effective access to justice.
Explanation
The first paragraph is based on Article 13 of the ECHR:
‘Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a
national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.’
However, in Union law the protection is more extensive since it guarantees the right to an effective remedy before a
court. The Court of Justice enshrined that right in its judgment of 15 May 1986 as a general principle of Union law
(Case 222/84 Johnston [1986] ECR 1651; see also judgment of 15 October 1987, Case 222/86 Heylens [1987]
ECR 4097 and judgment of 3 December 1992, Case C-97/91 Borelli [1992] ECR I-6313). According to the Court, that
general principle of Union law also applies to the Member States when they are implementing Union law. The inclusion
of this precedent in the Charter has not been intended to change the system of judicial review laid down by the Treaties,
and particularly the rules relating to admissibility for direct actions before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The European Convention has considered the Union's system of judicial review including the rules on admissibility, and
confirmed them while amending them as to certain aspects, as reflected in Articles III-353 to III-381 of the
Constitution, and in particular in Article III-365(4). Article 47 ( 2 ) applies to the institutions of the Union and of
Member States when they are implementing Union law and does so for all rights guaranteed by Union law.
( 1 ) Article II-112(2) of the Constitution.

The second paragraph corresponds to Article 6(1) of the ECHR which reads as follows:
‘In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a
fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment
shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of
morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the
private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special
circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.’
In Union law, the right to a fair hearing is not confined to disputes relating to civil law rights and obligations. That is
one of the consequences of the fact that the Union is a community based on the rule of law as stated by the Court in
Case 294/83, ‘Les Verts’ v European Parliament (judgment of 23 April 1986, [1988] ECR 1339). Nevertheless, in all
respects other than their scope, the guarantees afforded by the ECHR apply in a similar way to the Union.
With regard to the third paragraph, it should be noted that in accordance with the case-law of the European Court of
Human Rights, provision should be made for legal aid where the absence of such aid would make it impossible to
ensure an effective remedy (ECHR Judgment of 9 October 1979, Airey, Series A, Volume 32, 11). There is also a system
of legal assistance for cases before the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Article 48 ( 1 )
Presumption of innocence and right of defence
1. Everyone who has been charged shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
2. Respect for the rights of the defence of anyone who has been charged shall be guaranteed.
Explanation
Article 48 ( 1 ) is the same as Article 6(2) and (3) of the ECHR, which reads as follows:
‘2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.
3.
Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:
(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him;
(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;

Final act
(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not
sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so
require;
(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and
examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;
(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in
court.’
In accordance with Article 52(3) ( 1 ), this right has the same meaning and scope as the right
guaranteed by the ECHR.
Article 49 ( 2 )
Principles of legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties
1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did
not constitute a criminal offence under national law or international law at the time when it was
committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than that which was applicable at the time the
criminal offence was committed. If, subsequent to the commission of a criminal offence, the law
provides for a lighter penalty, that penalty shall be applicable.
2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission
which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles
recognised by the community of nations.
3.
The severity of penalties must not be disproportionate to the criminal offence.
Explanation
This Article follows the traditional rule of the non-retroactivity of laws and criminal sanctions. There has been added
the rule of the retroactivity of a more lenient penal law, which exists in a number of Member States and which features
in Article 15 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Article 7 of the ECHR is worded as follows:
‘1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a
criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty
be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.
2. This Article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time
when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.’

In paragraph 2, the reference to ‘civilised’ nations has been deleted; this does not change the meaning of this
paragraph, which refers to crimes against humanity in particular. In accordance with Article 52(3) ( 1 ), the right
guaranteed here therefore has the same meaning and scope as the right guaranteed by the ECHR.
Paragraph 3 states the general principle of proportionality between penalties and criminal offences which is
enshrined in the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and in the case-law of the Court of Justice
of the Communities.
Article 50 ( 2 )
Right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence
No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings for an offence for which
he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted within the Union in accordance with the law.
Explanation
Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR reads as follows:
‘1. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State
for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal
procedure of that State.
2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law
and the penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has
been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.
3. No derogation from this Article shall be made under Article 15 of the Convention.’
The ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies in Union law (see, among the many precedents, the judgment of 5 May 1966, Cases
18/65 and 35/65, Gutmann v Commission [1966] ECR 103 and a recent case, the decision of the Court of First
Instance of 20 April 1999, Joined Cases T-305/94 and others, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij NV v. Commission [1999]
ECR II-931). The rule prohibiting cumulation refers to cumulation of two penalties of the same kind, that is to say
criminal law penalties.
In accordance with Article 50 ( 2 ), the ‘non bis in idem’ rule applies not only within the jurisdiction of one State but also
between the jurisdictions of several Member States. That corresponds to the acquis in Union law; see Articles 54 to 58 of
the Schengen Convention and the judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 February 2003, C-187/01 Gözütok (not yet
published), Article 7 of the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests and
Article 10 of the Convention on the fight against corruption. The very limited exceptions in those Conventions
permitting the Member States to derogate from the ‘non bis in idem’ rule are covered by the horizontal clause in
Article 52(1) of the Charter ( 3 ) concerning limitations. As regards the situations referred to by Article 4 of Protocol
No 7, namely the application of the principle within the same Member State, the guaranteed right has the same meaning
and the same scope as the corresponding right in the ECHR.

TITLE VII
GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF THE CHARTER
Article 51 ( 1 )
Field of application
1. The provisions of this Charter are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of
the Union with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity and to the Member States only when they
are implementing Union law. They shall therefore respect the rights, observe the principles and
promote the application thereof in accordance with their respective powers and respecting the limits
of the powers of the Union as conferred on it in the other Parts of the Constitution.
2. This Charter does not extend the field of application of Union law beyond the powers of
the Union or establish any new power or task for the Union, or modify powers and tasks defined in
the other Parts of the Constitution.
Explanation
The aim of Article 51 ( 1 ) is to determine the scope of the Charter. It seeks to establish clearly that the Charter applies
primarily to the institutions and bodies of the Union, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This provision
was drafted in keeping with Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which required the Union to respect
fundamental rights, and with the mandate issued by Cologne European Council. The term ‘institutions’ is enshrined in
Part I of the Constitution. The expression ‘bodies, offices and agencies’ is commonly used in the Constitution to refer to
all the authorities set up by the Constitution or by secondary legislation (see, e.g., Articles I-50 or I-51 of the
Constitution).
As regards the Member States, it follows unambiguously from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the requirement
to respect fundamental rights defined in a Union context is only binding on the Member States when they act in the
scope of Union law (judgment of 13 July 1989, Case 5/88 Wachauf [1989] ECR 2609; judgment of 18 June 1991, ERT
[1991] ECR I-2925); judgment of 18 December 1997 (C-309/96 Annibaldi [1997] ECR I-7493). The Court of Justice
confirmed this case-law in the following terms: ‘In addition, it should be remembered that the requirements flowing
from the protection of fundamental rights in the Community legal order are also binding on Member States when they
implement Community rules ...’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, [2000] ECR 2737, paragraph 37 of the
grounds). Of course this rule, as enshrined in this Charter, applies to the central authorities as well as to regional or local
bodies, and to public organisations, when they are implementing Union law.
Paragraph 2, together with the second sentence of paragraph 1, confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of
extending the competences and tasks which the other Parts of the Constitution confer on the Union. Explicit mention is
made here of the logical consequences of the principle of subsidiarity and of the fact that the Union only has those
powers which have been conferred upon it. The fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Union do not have any effect
other than in the context of the powers determined by Parts I and III of the Constitution. Consequently, an obligation,
pursuant to the second sentence of paragraph 1, for the Union's institutions to promote principles laid down in the
Charter, may arise only within the limits of these same powers.

463
Paragraph 2 also confirms that the Charter may not have the effect of extending the field of application of Union law
beyond the powers of the Union as established in the other Parts of the Constitution. The Court of Justice has already
established this rule with respect to the fundamental rights recognised as part of Union law (judgment of 17 February
1998, C-249/96 Grant, 1998 ECR I-621, paragraph 45 of the grounds). In accordance with this rule, it goes without
saying that the incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution cannot be understood as extending by itself the range
of Member State action considered to be ‘implementation of Union law’ (within the meaning of paragraph 1 and the
above-mentioned case-law).
Article 52 ( 1 )
Scope and interpretation of rights and principles
1. Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be
provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of
proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of
general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.
2. Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in other Parts of the Constitution
shall be exercised under the conditions and within the limits defined by these relevant Parts.
3. Insofar as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those
rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. This provision shall not prevent
Union law providing more extensive protection.
4. Insofar as this Charter recognises fundamental rights as they result from the constitutional
traditions common to the Member States, those rights shall be interpreted in harmony with those
traditions.
5. The provisions of this Charter which contain principles may be implemented by legislative and
executive acts taken by institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, and by acts of
Member States when they are implementing Union law, in the exercise of their respective powers.
They shall be judicially cognisable only in the interpretation of such acts and in the ruling on their
legality.
6.
Full account shall be taken of national laws and practices as specified in this Charter.
7. The explanations drawn up as a way of providing guidance in the interpretation of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights shall be given due regard by the courts of the Union and of the Member States.

Final act
Explanation
The purpose of Article 52 ( 1 ) is to set the scope of the rights and principles of the Charter, and to lay down rules for
their interpretation. Paragraph 1 deals with the arrangements for the limitation of rights. The wording is based on the
case-law of the Court of Justice: ‘... it is well established in the case-law of the Court that restrictions may be imposed on
the exercise of fundamental rights, in particular in the context of a common organisation of the market, provided that
those restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the Community and do not constitute,
with regard to the aim pursued, disproportionate and unreasonable interference undermining the very substance of
those rights’ (judgment of 13 April 2000, Case C-292/97, paragraph 45 of the grounds). The reference to general
interests recognised by the Union covers both the objectives mentioned in Article I-2 of the Constitution and other
interests protected by specific provisions of the Constitution such as Articles I-5(1), III-133(3), III-154 and III-436.
Paragraph 2 refers to rights which were already expressly guaranteed in the Treaty establishing the European
Community and have been recognised in the Charter, and which are now found in other Parts of the Constitution
(notably the rights derived from Union citizenship). It clarifies that such rights remain subject to the conditions and
limits applicable to the Union law on which they are based, and for which provision is now made in Parts I and III of the
Constitution. The Charter does not alter the system of rights conferred by the EC Treaty and now taken over by Parts I
and III of the Constitution.
Paragraph 3 is intended to ensure the necessary consistency between the Charter and the ECHR by establishing the rule
that, insofar as the rights in the present Charter also correspond to rights guaranteed by the ECHR, the meaning and
scope of those rights, including authorised limitations, are the same as those laid down by the ECHR. This means in
particular that the legislator, in laying down limitations to those rights, must comply with the same standards as are
fixed by the detailed limitation arrangements laid down in the ECHR, which are thus made applicable for the rights
covered by this paragraph, without thereby adversely affecting the autonomy of Union law and of that of the Court of
Justice of the European Union.
The reference to the ECHR covers both the Convention and the Protocols to it. The meaning and the scope of the
guaranteed rights are determined not only by the text of those instruments, but also by the case-law of the European
Court of Human Rights and by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The last sentence of the paragraph is
designed to allow the Union to guarantee more extensive protection. In any event, the level of protection afforded by
the Charter may never be lower than that guaranteed by the ECHR.
The Charter does not affect the possibilities of Member States to avail themselves of Article 15 ECHR, allowing
derogations from ECHR rights in the event of war or of other public dangers threatening the life of the nation, when
they take action in the areas of national defence in the event of war and of the maintenance of law and order, in
accordance with their responsibilities recognised in Articles I-5 (1), III-131, III-262 of the Constitution.
The list of rights which may at the present stage, without precluding developments in the law, legislation and the
Treaties, be regarded as corresponding to rights in the ECHR within the meaning of the present paragraph is given
hereafter. It does not include rights additional to those in the ECHR.

— Article 14(1) ( 2 ) corresponds to Article 2 of the Protocol to the ECHR, but its scope is extended to cover access

— Article 14(3) ( 2 ) corresponds to Article 2 of the Protocol to the ECHR as regards the rights of parents
— Article 47(2) and (3) ( 3 ) correspond to Article 6(1) of the ECHR, but the limitation to the determination of civil
rights and obligations or criminal charges does not apply as regards Union law and its implementation
— Article 50 ( 4 ) corresponds to Article 4 of Protocol No 7 to the ECHR, but its scope is extended to European
Union level between the Courts of the Member States.
— Finally, citizens of the European Union may not be considered as aliens in the scope of the application of
Union law, because of the prohibition of any discrimination on grounds of nationality. The limitations
provided for by Article 16 of the ECHR as regards the rights of aliens therefore do not apply to them in this
context.
The rule of interpretation contained in paragraph 4 has been based on the wording of Article 6(2) of the Treaty on
European Union (cf. now the wording of Article I-9(3) of the Constitution) and takes due account of the approach
to common constitutional traditions followed by the Court of Justice (e.g., judgment of 13 December 1979,
Case 44/79 Hauer [1979] ECR 3727; judgment of 18 May 1982, Case 155/79, AM&S, [1982] ECR 1575). Under
that rule, rather than following a rigid approach of ‘a lowest common denominator’, the Charter rights concerned
should be interpreted in a way offering a high standard of protection which is adequate for the law of the Union
and in harmony with the common constitutional traditions.
Paragraph 5 clarifies the distinction between ‘rights’ and ‘principles’ set out in the Charter. According to that
distinction, subjective rights shall be respected, whereas principles shall be observed (Article 51 (1)) ( 5 ). Principles
may be implemented through legislative or executive acts (adopted by the Union in accordance with its powers,
and by the Member States only when they implement Union law); accordingly, they become significant for the
Courts only when such acts are interpreted or reviewed. They do not however give rise to direct claims for positive
action by the Union's institutions or Member States authorities. This is consistent both with case-law of the Court
of Justice (Cf. notably case-law on the ‘precautionary principle’ in Article 174 (2) TEC (replaced by Article III-233 of
the Constitution): judgment of the CFI of 11 September 2002, T-13/99, Pfizer vs. Council, with numerous
references to earlier case-law; and a series of judgments on Article 33 (ex 39) on the principles of agricultural law,
e.g. judgment of the Court of Justice C-265/85, Van den Berg, 1987 ECR 1155: scrutiny of the principle of market
stabilisation and of reasonable expectations) and with the approach of the Member States' constitutional systems to
( 1 ) Article II-72 of the Constitution.
( 2 ) Article II-74 of the Constitution.
3 ( ) Article II-107 of the Constitution.
( 4 ) Article II-110 of the Constitution.

‘principles’ particularly in the field of social law. For illustration, examples for principles recognised in the Charter
include e.g. Articles 25, 26 and 37 ( 1 ). In some cases, an Article of the Charter may contain both elements of a
right and of a principle, e.g. Articles 23, 33 and 34 ( 2 ).
Paragraph 6 refers to the various Articles in the Charter which, in the spirit of subsidiarity, make reference to
national laws and practices.
Article 53 ( 3 )
Level of protection
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as restricting or adversely affecting human rights and
fundamental freedoms as recognised, in their respective fields of application, by Union law and
international law and by international agreements to which the Union or all the Member States are
party, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms, and by the Member States' constitutions.
Explanation
This provision is intended to maintain the level of protection currently afforded within their respective scope by Union
law, national law and international law. Owing to its importance, mention is made of the ECHR.
Article 54 ( 4 )
Prohibition of abuse of rights
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or to
perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised in this Charter
or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for herein.
Explanation
This Article corresponds to Article 17 of the ECHR:
‘Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any
activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their
limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.’

Declaration on Article III-116
The Conference agrees that, in its general efforts to eliminate inequalities between women and men,
the Union will aim in its different policies to combat all kinds of domestic violence. The
Member States should take all necessary measures to prevent and punish these criminal acts and to
support and protect the victims.
14.
Declaration on Articles III-136 and III-267
The Conference considers that in the event that a draft European law or framework law based
on Article III-267(2) would affect fundamental aspects of the social security system of a
Member State, including its scope, cost or financial structure, or would affect the financial balance of
that system as set out in Article III-136(2), the interests of that Member State will be duly taken into
account.
15.
Declaration on Articles III-160 and III-322
The Conference recalls that the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms implies, in particular,
that proper attention is given to the protection and observance of the due process rights of the
individuals or entities concerned. For this purpose and in order to guarantee a thorough judicial
review of European decisions subjecting an individual or entity to restrictive measures, such decisions
must be based on clear and distinct criteria. These criteria should be tailored to the specifics of each
restrictive measure.
16.
Declaration on Article III-167(2)(c)
The Conference notes that Article III-167(2)(c) shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing
case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance
regarding the applicability of the provisions to aid granted to certain areas of the Federal Republic of
Germany affected by the former division of Germany.
17.
Declaration on Article III-184
With regard to Article III-184, the Conference confirms that raising growth potential and securing
sound budgetary positions are the two pillars of the economic and fiscal policy of the Union and the
Member States. The Stability and Growth Pact is an important tool to achieve these goals.
The Conference reaffirms its commitment to the provisions concerning the Stability and Growth Pact
as the framework for the coordination of budgetary policies in the Member States.
The Conference confirms that a rule-based system is the best guarantee for commitments to be
enforced and for all Member States to be treated equally.954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481

Within this framework, the Conference also reaffirms its commitment to the goals of the
Lisbon Strategy: job creation, structural reforms, and social cohesion.
The Union aims at achieving balanced economic growth and price stability. Economic and budgetary
policies thus need to set the right priorities towards economic reforms, innovation, competitiveness
and strengthening of private investment and consumption in phases of weak economic growth. This
should be reflected in the orientations of budgetary decisions at the national and Union level in
particular through restructuring of public revenue and expenditure while respecting budgetary
discipline in accordance with the Constitution and the Stability and Growth Pact.
Budgetary and economic challenges facing the Member States underline the importance of sound
budgetary policy throughout the economic cycle.
The Conference agrees that Member States should use periods of economic recovery actively to
consolidate public finances and improve their budgetary positions. The objective is to gradually
achieve a budgetary surplus in good times which creates the necessary room to accommodate
economic downturns and thus contribute to the long-term sustainability of public finances.
The Member States look forward to possible proposals of the Commission as well as further
contributions of Member States with regard to strengthening and clarifying the implementation of
the Stability and Growth Pact. The Member States will take all necessary measures to raise the growth
potential of their economies. Improved economic policy coordination could support this objective.
This Declaration does not prejudge the future debate on the Stability and Growth Pact.
18.
Declaration on Article III-213
The Conference confirms that the policies described in Article III-213 fall essentially within the
competence of the Member States. Measures to provide encouragement and promote coordination to
be taken at Union level in accordance with this Article shall be of a complementary nature. They shall
serve to strengthen cooperation between Member States and not to harmonise national systems. The
guarantees and practices existing in each Member State as regards the responsibility of the social
partners will not be affected.
This Declaration is without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution conferring competence on
the Union, including in social matters.

Declaration on Article III-220

disadvantages caused by the division of Germany to the economy of certain areas of the
Federal Republic affected by that division’ shall be interpreted in accordance with the existing case-
law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and of the Court of First Instance.

Declaration on Article III-296
The Conference declares that, as soon as the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe is signed,
the Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the common foreign and security

External Action Service.

Declaration on Article III-325 concerning the negotiation and conclusion of
international agreements by Member States relating to the area of freedom, security and

third countries or international organisations in the areas covered by Sections 3, 4 and 5 of
Chapter IV of Title III of Part III of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe insofar as such
agreements comply with Union law.954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481

Declaration on Article III-402(4)
Article III-402(4) of the Constitution provides that where no European law of the Council
establishing a new financial framework has been adopted by the end of the previous financial
framework, the ceilings and other provisions corresponding to the last year of that framework shall
be extended until such time as that law is adopted.
The Conference states that if no European law of the Council establishing a new financial framework
has been adopted by the end of 2006 and where the Treaty of Accession of 16 April 2003 provides
for a phasing-in period for the allocation of appropriations to the new Member States ending
in 2006, the allocation of funds as from 2007 will be established on the basis of the same criteria
being applied for all Member States.

the extension of qualified majority voting or to have recourse to the ordinary legislative procedure.
28.
Declaration on Article IV-440(7)
The High Contracting Parties agree that the European Council, pursuant to Article IV-440(7), will
take a European decision leading to the modification of the status of Mayotte with regard to the
Union in order to make this territory an outermost region within the meaning of Article IV-440(2)
and Article III-424, when the French authorities notify the European Council and the Commission
that the evolution currently underway in the internal status of the island so allows.
29.
Declaration on Article IV-448(2)
The Conference considers that the possibility of producing translations of the Treaty establishing a
Constitution for Europe in the languages mentioned in Article IV-448(2) contributes to fulfilling the
objective of respecting the Union's rich cultural and linguistic diversity as set forth in the
fourth subparagraph of Article I-3(3) of that Treaty. In this context, the Conference confirms the
attachment of the Union to the cultural diversity of Europe and the special attention it will continue
to pay to these and other languages.
The Conference recommends that those Member States wishing to avail themselves of the possibility
recognised in Article IV-448(2) communicate to the Council, within six months from the date of the
signature of that Treaty, the language or languages into which translations of that Treaty will be
made.954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481

THE CONFERENCE,
Recalling that the Joint Declaration on the Sovereign Base Areas of the United Kingdom of

Taking account of the provisions concerning the Sovereign Base Areas set out in the Treaty
concerning the Establishment of the Republic of Cyprus (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Treaty of
Establishment’) and the associated Exchanges of Notes dated 16 August 1960,
Noting the Exchange of Notes between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government
of the Republic of Cyprus concerning the administration of the Sovereign Base Areas, dated
16 August 1960, and the attached Declaration by the United Kingdom Government that one of the
main objects to be achieved is the protection of the interests of those resident or working in the

customs and taxation;
Confirming that the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the Union should not affect the rights

decommissioning effort also after Lithuania's accession to the Union for the period until 2006 and
beyond and noting that Lithuania, bearing in mind this expression of Union solidarity, has
committed to close Unit 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant before 2005 and Unit 2 by 2009;
Recognising that the decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant with two 1500 MW
RBMK-type reactor units inherited from the former Soviet Union is of an unprecedented nature and
represents for Lithuania an exceptional financial burden not commensurate with the size and
economic strength of the country and that this decommissioning will continue beyond the current
Financial Perspective as defined by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999;
Noting the need to adopt implementing provisions for the additional Union assistance to address the

Declaration concerning the Protocol on the position of Denmark
The Conference notes that with respect to legal acts to be adopted by the Council acting alone or

Declaration concerning Italy
The Conference notes that the Protocol on Italy annexed in 1957 to the Treaty establishing the
European Economic Community, as amended upon adoption of the Treaty on European Union,
stated that:
‘THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES,
DESIRING to settle certain particular problems relating to Italy,
HAVE AGREED upon the following provisions, which shall be annexed to this Treaty:
THE MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMUNITY
TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Italian Government is carrying out a ten-year programme of economic
expansion designed to rectify the disequilibria in the structure of the Italian economy, in particular by
providing an infrastructure for the less developed areas in Southern Italy and in the Italian islands and
by creating new jobs in order to eliminate unemployment;
RECALL that the principles and objectives of this programme of the Italian Government have been
considered and approved by organisations for international cooperation of which the Member States
are members;
RECOGNISE that it is in their common interest that the objectives of the Italian programme should be
attained;
AGREE , in order to facilitate the accomplishment of this task by the Italian Government, to
recommend to the institutions of the Community that they should employ all the methods and
procedures provided in this Treaty and, in particular, make appropriate use of the resources of the
European Investment Bank and the European Social Fund;
ARE OF THE OPINION that the institutions of the Community should, in applying this Treaty, take
account of the sustained effort to be made by the Italian economy in the coming years and of the
desirability of avoiding dangerous stresses in particular within the balance of payments or the level of
employment, which might jeopardise the application of this Treaty in Italy;
RECOGNISE that in the event of Articles 109h and 109i being applied it will be necessary to take care
that any measures required of the Italian Government do not prejudice the completion of its
programme for economic expansion and for raising the standard of living of the population.’954393_TRAITE_EN_451_481

the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Austria and the Kingdom of Sweden
Germany, Ireland, Hungary, Austria and Sweden note that the core provisions of the Treaty
establishing the European Atomic Energy Community have not been substantially amended since its

soon as possible.
45.
Declaration by the Kingdom of Spain and
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
The Treaty establishing the Constitution applies to Gibraltar as a European territory for whose

and Northern Ireland on the definition of the term ‘nationals’
In respect of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and the Treaty establishing the

components of the national parliamentary system or chambers of the national Parliament.
50.
Declaration by the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Hungary
