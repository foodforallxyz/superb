In the world today all culture, all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to definite political lines. 

There is no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. 

Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause. They are, as Lenin said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine.

Revolutionary culture is a powerful revolutionary weapon for the masses. It prepares the ground ideologically before the revolution comes. It is an essential fighting front in the general revolutionary front.

All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.

Our literary and art workers must accomplish this task and shift their stand. They must gradually move their feet over to the side of the workers, peasants and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, through the process of going into their very midst and into the thick of practical struggles and through the process of studying Marxism and society. 

Only in this way can we have a literature and art that are truly for the workers, peasants and soldiers, a truly proletarian literature and art.

[Our purpose is] to ensure that literature and art fit well into the whole
revolutionary machine as a component part, that they operate as powerful
weapons for uniting and educating the people and for attacking anddestroying the enemy, and that they help the people fight the enemy with one
heart and one mind.

In literary and art criticism there are two criteria, the political and the
artistic…

There is the political criterion and there is the artistic criterion; what is the
relationship between the two? Politics cannot be equated with art, nor can a
general world outlook be equated with a method of artistic creation and
criticism. We deny not only that there is an abstract and absolutely
unchangeable political criterion, but also that there is an abstract and
absolutely unchangeable artistic criterion; each class in every class society
has its own political and artistic criteria. But all classes in all class societies
invariably put the political criterion first and the artistic criterion second…
What we demand is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the highest possible perfection of artistic form. Works of art which lack artistic quality have no force, however progressive they are politically. Therefore, we oppose both works of art with a wrong political viewpoint and the tendency towards the "poster and slogan style" which is correct in political viewpoint but lacking in
artistic power. On questions of literature and art we must carry on a struggle on two fronts.


Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend
is the policy for promoting the progress of the arts and the sciences and a
flourishing socialist culture in our land. Different forms and styles in art
should develop freely and different schools in science should contend freely.
We think that it is harmful to the growth of art and science if administrative
measures are used to impose one particular style of art or school of thought
and to ban another. Questions of right and wrong in the arts and sciences
should be settled through free discussion in artistic and scientific circles and
through practical work in these fields. They should not be settled in summary
fashion.

An army without culture is a dull-witted army, and a dull-witted army cannotdefeat the enemy.

In transforming a backward agricultural China into an advanced
industrialized country, we are confronted with arduous tasks and our
experience is far from adequate. So we must be good at learning.
"Opening Address at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China "
(September 15, 1956).
Conditions are changing all the time, and to adapt one's thinking to the new
conditions, one must study. Even those who have a better grasp of Marxism
and are comparatively firm in their proletarian stand have to go on studying,
have to absorb what is new and study new problems.

(March 12, 1957), 1st pocket ed., p. 8.*
We can learn what we did not know. We are not only good at destroying the
old world, we are also good at building the new.
"Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China " (March 5, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 374.
Now, there are two different attitudes towards learning from others. One is
the dogmatic attitude of transplanting everything, whether or not it is suited
to our conditions. This is no good. The other attitude is to use our heads and
learn those things which suit our conditions, that is, to absorb whatever
experience is useful to us. That is the attitude we should adopt.

The theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin is universally applicable. We
should regard it not as a dogma, but as a guide to action. Studying it is not
merely a matter of learning terms and phrases but of learning Marxism-
Leninism as the science of revolution. It is not just a matter of understanding
the general laws derived by Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin from their
extensive study of real life and revolutionary experience, but of studying their
standpoint and method in examining and solving problems."The Role of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War" (October 1938),
Selected Works, Vol. II, pp. 208-09.
If we have a correct theory but merely prate about it, pigeonhole it and do not
put it into practice, then that theory, however good, is of no significance.
"On Practice" (July 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 304.
It is necessary to master Marxist theory and apply it, master it for the sole
purpose of applying it. If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in
elucidating one or two practical problems, you should be commended and
credited with some achievement. The more problems you elucidate and the
more comprehensively and profoundly you do so, the greater will be your
achievement.
"Rectify the Party's Style of Work" (February 1, 1942), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 38.
How is Marxist-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the Chinese
revolution? To use a common expression, it is by "shooting the arrow at the
target". As the arrow is to the target, so is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese
revolution. Some comrades, however, are "shooting without a target",
shooting at random, and such people are liable to harm the revolution.
Ibid., p. 42.
Those experienced in work must take up the study of theory and must read
seriously; only then will they be able to systematize and synthesize their
experience and raise it to the level of theory, only then will they not mistake
their partial experience for universal truth and not commit empiricist errors.

Reading is learning, but applying is also learning and the more important
kind of learning at that. Our chief method is to learn warfare through warfare.
A person who has had no opportunity to go to school can also learn warfare -
he can learn through fighting in war. A revolutionary war is a mass
undertaking; it is often not a matter of first learning and then doing, but of
doing and then learning, for doing is itself learning.
"Problems of Strategy in China 's Revolutionary War" (December 1936), Selected
Works, Vol. I, pp. 189-90.
There is a gap between the ordinary civilian and the soldier, but it is no Great
Wall, and it can be quickly closed, and the way to close it is to take part inrevolution, in war. By saying that it is not easy to learn and to apply, we
mean that it is hard to learn thoroughly and to apply skilfully. By saying that
civilians can very quickly become soldiers, we mean that it is not difficult to
cross the threshold. To put the two statements together, we may cite the
Chinese adage, "Nothing in the world is difficult for one who sets his mind to
it." To cross the threshold is not difficult, and mastery, too, is possible
provided one sets one's mind to the task and is good at learning.
Ibid., p. 190.
We must learn to do economic work from all who know how, no matter who
they are. We must esteem them as teachers, learning from them respectfully
and conscientiously. We must not pretend to know when we do not know.

Knowledge is a matter of science, and no dishonesty or conceit whatsoever is
permissible. What is required is definitely the reverse - honesty and modesty.
"On Practice" (July 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 300.
Complacency is the enemy of study. We cannot really learn anything until we
rid ourselves of complacency. Our attitude towards ourselves should be "to
be insatiable in learning" and towards others "to be tireless in teaching".
"The Role of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War" (October 1938),
Selected Works, Vol. II, p. 210.
Some people have read a few Marxist books and think themselves quite
learned but what they have read has not penetrated, has not struck root in
their minds, so that they do not know how to use it and their class feelings
remain as of old. Others are very conceited and having learned some book-
phrases, think themselves terrific and are very cocky; but whenever a storm
blows up, they take a stand very different from that of the workers and the
majority of the peasants. They waver while the latter stand firm, they
equivocate while the latter are forthright.
Speech at the Chinese Communist Party's National Conference on Propaganda Work
(March 12, 1957), 1st pocket ed., pp. 7-8.

In order to have a real grasp of Marxism, one must learn it not only from
books, but mainly through class struggle, through practical work and close
contact with the masses of workers and peasants. When in addition to readingsome Marxist books our intellectuals have gained some understanding
through close contact with the masses of workers and peasants and through
their own practical work, we will all be speaking the same language, not only
the common language of patriotism and the common language of the socialist
system, but probably even the common language of the communist world
outlook. If that happens, all of us will certainly work much better.
