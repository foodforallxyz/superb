This army has an indomitable spirit and is determined to vanquish all
enemies and never to yield. No matter what the difficulties and hardships, so
long as a single man remains, he will fight on.
"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 264.*
Give full play to our style of fighting - courage in battle, no fear of sacrifice,
no fear of fatigue, and continuous fighting (that is, fighting successive battles
in a short time without rest).
"The Present Situation and Our Tasks" (December 25, 1947), Selected Works, Vol. IV,
p. 161.
Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically laid down their lives
for the people; let us hold their banner high and march ahead along the path
crimson with their blood!
"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 318.
Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory.
"The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" (June 11, 1945), Selected
Works, Vol. III, p. 321.*
At a critical moment in the progress of the Northern Expedition,… the
treacherous and reactionary policies of "party purge" and massacre adopted
by the Kuomintang authorities wrecked this national united front - the united
front of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party and all sections of the people,
which embodied the Chinese people's cause of liberation - and all its
revolutionary policies… Thereupon unity was replaced by civil war,
democracy by dictatorship, and a China full of brightness by a China covered
in darkness. But the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were
neither cowed nor conquered nor exterminated. They picked themselves up,
wiped off the blood, buried their fallen comrades and went into battle again.
Holding high the great standard of revolution, they rose in armed resistance
and over a vast territory in China they set up people's governments, carried
out land reform, built up a people's army - the Chinese Red Army - andpreserved and expanded the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people.
"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 261.*
You have many good qualities and have rendered great service, but you must
always remember not to become conceited. You are respected by all, and
quite rightly, but this easily leads to conceit. If you become conceited, if you
are not modest and cease to exert yourselves, and if you do not respect others,
do not respect the cadres and the masses, then you will cease to be heroes and
models. There have been such people in the past, and I hope you will not
follow their example.
"We Must Learn to Do Economic Work" (January 10, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III,
p. 239.
In the fight to wipe out the enemy and to restore and increase industrial and
agricultural production, you have overcome many difficulties and hardships
and demonstrated immense courage, wisdom and initiative. You are models
for the whole Chinese nation, the backbone of the victorious advance of the
people's cause in all spheres, pillars of support to the People's Government
and bridges linking the People's Government with the great masses.
Message of greetings on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party to the Meeting of Representatives of National Combat Heroes and Model
Workers (September 25, 1950).
We the Chinese nation have the spirit to fight the enemy to the last drop of
our blood, the determination to recover our lost territory by our own efforts,
and the ability to stand on our own feet in the family of nations.
"On Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism" (December 27, 1935), Selected Works,
Vol. I, p. 170.*20. B UILDING O UR C OUNTRY T HROUGH
D ILIGENCE AND F RUGALITY
We must see to it that all our cadres and all our people constantly bear in
mind that ours is a big socialist country but an economically backward and
poor one, and that this is a very great contradiction. To make China rich and
strong needs several decades of intense effort, which will include, among
other things, the effort to practise strict economy and combat waste, i.e., the
policy of building up our country through diligence and frugality.
On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957),
1st pocket ed., p. 71.
Diligence and frugality should be practised in running factories and shops
and all state-owned, co-operative and other enterprises. The principle of
diligence and frugality should be observed in everything. This principle of
economy is one of the basic principles of socialist economics. China is a big
country, but she is still very poor. It will take several decades to make China
prosperous. Even then we will still have to observe the principle of diligence
and frugality. But it is in the coming few decades, during the present series of
five-year plans, that we must particularly advocate diligence and frugality,
that we must pay special attention to economy.
Introductory note to "Running a Co-operative Diligently and Frugally" (1955), The
Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside, Chinese ed., Vol. I.
Wherever we happen to be, we must treasure our manpower and material
resources, and must not take a short view and indulge in wastefulness and
extravagance. Wherever we are, from the very first year of our work we must
bear in mind the many years to come, the protracted war that must be
maintained, the counter-offensive, and the work of reconstruction after the
enemy's expulsion. On the one hand, never be wasteful or extravagant; on the
other, actively expand production. Previously, in some places people suffered
a great deal because they did not take the long view and neglected economy
in manpower and material resources and the expansion of production. The
lesson is there and attention must be called to it."We Must Learn to Do Economic Work" (January 10, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III,
p. 244.
In order to speed up this restoration and development [of agricultural
production and industrial production in small towns], we must do our utmost,
in the course of our struggle for the abolition of the feudal system, to preserve
all useful means of production and of livelihood, take resolute measures
against anyone's destroying or wasting them, oppose extravagant eating and
drinking and pay attention to thrift and economy.
"Speech at a Conference of Cadres in the Shansi-Suiyuan Liberated Area" (April 1,
1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 238.
Thrift should be the guiding principle in our government expenditure. It
should be made clear to all government workers that corruption and waste are
very great crimes. Our campaigns against corruption and waste have already
achieved some results, but further efforts are required. Our system of
accounting must be guided by the principle of saving every copper for the
war effort, for the revolutionary cause and for our economic construction.
"Our Economic Policy" (January 23, 1934), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 145.
A dangerous tendency has shown itself of late among many of our personnel
- an unwillingness to share the joys and hardships of the masses, a concern
for personal fame and gain. This is very bad. One way of overcoming it is to
simplify our organizations in the course of our campaign to increase
production and practise economy, and to transfer cadres to lower levels so
that a considerable number will return to productive work.
On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957),
1st pocket ed., p 71.
Production by the army for its own support has not only improved the army's
living conditions and lightened the burden on the people, thereby making it
possible further to expand the army. In addition, it has had many immediate
side-effects. They are as follows:
1. Improved relations between officers and men. Officers and men work
together in production and become like brothers.
2. Better attitude to labour… since the army began to produce for its own
support, the attitude to labour has improved and loafer ways have been
overcome.
3. Strengthened discipline. Far from weakening discipline in battle and inarmy life, labour discipline in production actually strengthens it.
4. Improved relations between the army and the people. Once an armed
force begins to "keep house" for itself, encroachments upon the property
of the people seldom or never occur. As the army and the people
exchange labour and help each other in production, the friendship
between them is strengthened.
5. Less grumbling in the army about the government and improved
relations between the two.
6. An impetus to the great production campaign of the people. Once the
army engages in production, the need for government and other
organizations to do likewise becomes more obvious, and they do so
more energetically; also, the need for a universal campaign of the whole
people to increase production naturally becomes more obvious, and this
too is carried on more energetically.
"On Production by the Army for Its Own Support and on the Importance of the Great
Movements for Rectification and for Production" (April 27, 1945), Selected Works,
Vol. III, pp. 327-28.*
Some people say that if the army units go in for production, they will be
unable to train or fight and that if the government and other organizations do
so, they will be unable to do their own work. This is a false argument. In
recent years our army units in the Border Region have undertaken production
on a big scale to provide themselves with ample food and clothing and have
simultaneously done their training and conducted their political studies and
literacy and other courses much more successfully than before, and there is
greater unity than ever within the army and between the army and the people.
While there was a large-scale production campaign at the front last year,
great successes were gained in the fighting and in addition an extensive
training campaign was started. And thanks to production, the personnel of the
government and other organizations live a better life and work with greater
devotion and efficiency; this is the case both in the Border Region and at the
front.
"We Must Learn to Do Economic Work" (January 10, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III,
pp. 243-44.21. S ELF -R ELIANCE AND A RDUOUS S TRUGGLE
On what basis should our policy rest? It should rest on our own strength, and
that means regeneration through one's own efforts. We are not alone; all the
countries and people in the world opposed to imperialism are our friends.
Nevertheless, we stress regeneration through our own efforts. Relying on the
forces we ourselves organize, we can defeat all Chinese and foreign
reactionaries.
"The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against
Japan" (August 13, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 20.
We stand for self-reliance. We hope for foreign aid but cannot be dependent
on it; we depend on our own efforts, on the creative power of the whole army
and the entire people.
"We Must Learn to Do Economic Work" (January 10, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III,
p. 241.
To win country-wide victory is only the first step in a long march of ten
thousand li… The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the
revolution will be longer, the work greater and more arduous. This must be
made clear now in the Party. The comrades must be helped to remain modest,
prudent and free from arrogance and rashness in their style of work. The
comrades must be helped to preserve the style of plain living and hard
struggle.

"Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (March 5, 1949), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 374.*
We must thoroughly clear away all ideas among our cadres of winning easy
victories through good luck, without hard and bitter struggle, without sweat
and blood.
"Build Stable Base Areas in the North-east" (December 28, 1945), Selected Works,
Vol. IV, p. 84.

We should carry on constant propaganda among the people on the facts of
world progress and the bright future ahead so that they will build theirconfidence in victory. At the same time, we must tell the people and tell our
comrades that there will be twists and turns in our road, There are still many
obstacles and difficulties along the road of revolution. The Seventh Congress
of our Party assumed that the difficulties would be many, for we preferred to
assume there would be more difficulties rather than less. Some comrades do
not like to think much about difficulties. But difficulties are facts; we must
recognize as many difficulties as there are and should not adopt a "policy of
non-recognition". We must recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat
them. There are no straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow
a road which twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap. It must
not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go down on
their knees of their own accord. In a word, while the prospects are bright, the
road has twists and turns. There are still many difficulties ahead which we
must not overlook. By uniting with the entire people in a common effort, we
can certainly overcome all difficulties and win victory.
"On the Chungking Negotiations" (October 17, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, pp.
59-60.

Anyone who sees only the bright side but not the difficulties cannot fight
effectively for the accomplishment of the Party's tasks.
"On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. III, p. 314.
The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants and working
intellectuals. If they take their destiny into their own hands, follow a Marxist-
Leninist line and take an active attitude in solving problems instead of
evading them, there will be no difficulty in the world which they cannot
overcome.

Introductory note to "The Party Secretary Takes the Lead and All the Party Members
Help Run the Co-operatives" (1955), The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside,
Chinese ed., Vol. I.

The comrades throughout the Party must take all this fully into account and
be prepared to overcome all difficulties with an indomitable will and in a
planned way. The reactionary forces and we both have difficulties. But the
difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are
forces on the verge of death and have no future. Our difficulties can be
overcome because we are new and rising forces and have a bright future.
"Greet the New High Tide of the Chinese Revolution" (February 1, 1947), Selected
Works, Vol. IV, p. 125.In times of difficulty we must not lose sight of our achievements, must see
the bright future and must pluck up our courage.
"Serve the People" (September 8, 1944), Selected Works, Vol. III, pp. 227-28.
New things always have to experience difficulties and setbacks as they grow.
It is sheer fantasy to imagine that the cause of socialism is all plain sailing
and easy success, without difficulties and setbacks or the exertion of
tremendous efforts.

On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People (February 27, 1957),
1st pocket ed., pp. 32-33.

At certain times in the revolutionary struggle, the difficulties outweigh the
favourable conditions and so constitute the principal aspect of the
contradiction and the favourable conditions constitute the secondary aspect.
But through their efforts the revolutionaries can overcome the difficulties step
by step and open up a favourable new situation, thus a difficult situation
yields place to a favourable one.

"On Contradiction" (August 1937), Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 335.
What is work? Work is struggle. There are difficulties and problems in those
places for us to overcome and solve. We go there to work and struggle to
overcome these difficulties. A good comrade is one who is more eager to go
where the difficulties are greater.

"On the Chungking Negotiations" (October 17, 1945), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 58.
There is an ancient Chinese fable called "The Foolish Old Man Who
Removed the Mountains". It tells of an old man who lived in northern China
long, long ago and was known as the Foolish Old Man of North Mountain.
His house faced south and beyond his doorway stood the two great peaks,
Taihang and Wangwu, obstructing the way. With great determination, he led
his sons in digging up these mountains hoe in hand. Another greybeard,
known as the Wise Old Man, saw them and said derisively, "How silly of you
to do this! It is quite impossible for you few to dig up these two huge
mountains." The Foolish Old Man replied, "When I die, my sons will carry
on; when they die, there will be my grandsons, and t'nen their sons and
grandsons, and so on to infinity. High as they are, the mountains cannot grow
any higher and with every bit we dig, they will be that much lower. Why can'twe clear them away?" Having refuted the Wise Old Man's wrong view, he
went on digging every day, unshaken in his conviction. God was moved by
this, and he sent down two angels, who carried the mountains away on their
backs. Today, two big mountains lie like a dead weight on the Chinese
people. One is imperialism, the other is feudalism. The Chinese Communist
Party has long made up its mind to dig them up. We must persevere and work
unceasingly, and we, too, will touch God's heart. Our God is none other than
the masses of the Chinese people. If they stand up and dig together with us,
why can't these two mountains be cleared away?
"The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" (June 11, 1945), Selected
Works, Vol. III, p. 322.*
