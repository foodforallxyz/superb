## Wisdom 

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
I will discover justice by starting with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect. Being perfect, therefore, has:
<ul>
  <li>wisdom,</li>
  <li>courage,</li>
  <li>temperance, and</li>
  <li>justice.</li>
</ul>

Wisdom is the first virtue found in a State. It means being good in counsel. Good counsel is a kind of knowledge because ignorant men cannot counsel well. There are many and diverse kinds of knowledge in a State, such as the knowledge carpentry. But this kind of knowledge does not make a city wise. A wise city is not one that counsels best on carpentry. A city is called agricultural because it has a knowledge in agriculture. But what is the knowledge that created the State? This knowledge advises citizens on:
<ul>
  <li>general things about the entire State, and</li>
  <li>how a State can best deal with itself and with other States.</li>
</ul>

It is the knowledge of the guardians from which the city gets good counsel and wisdom. In our city, there will be more smiths than true guardians. The guardians will be the smallest of all the classes, as ordained by nature.

The whole State thus is natural and will be wise. <!-- This has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom. --> Thus, we have discovered the nature and place of one of the four virtues in the State. 
{{< /l >}}


## Courage is Steadfastness Against Adversity and Temptation

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}It is easier to see the nature of courage. Everyone who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will be thinking of how the people fight in a war on the State's behalf. But this is not the courage that I mean.
<!-- The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly.
But their courage or cowardice will not make the city either courageous or cowardly. -->

I define courage as the city preserving a portion of itself against things to be feared under all circumstances, as our legislator has educated them. 'Under all circumstances' means either in pleasure or in pain, desire or fear. This courage is a kind of salvation that respects things to be feared, what they are and of what nature, which the law implants through education.

Dyers want to dye wool <!-- for making the true sea-purple, they begin --> by selecting their white colour first. They prepare this with much care and pains so that the white ground may take the hue in full perfection. The dyeing then proceeds. Whatever is dyed in this way gains the permanent colour which cannot be removed by washing. But when the ground has not been duly prepared, the colour will have a poor look.

This is why we educated our soldiers in music and gymnastic. We were building the influence which would prepare them to absorb the dye of the laws perfectly.
The colour of their opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training. It is not to be washed away by the potent lyes of sorrow, fear, or pleasure. Pleasure is a mightier agent for washing the soul than any soda or lye. Desire is the mightiest of all other solvents. Courage is this sort of universal saving power of true opinion.
<!-- about dangers and of every other opinion  -->
<!--  in conformity with law about real and false dangers. -->
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
I agree. I suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or a slave. To you, such uninstructed courage is not the courage which the law ordains, and should have another name.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Yes, I mean 'the courage of a citizen.' But we are seeking justice and not courage. We have said enough about courage. 

Two virtues of temperance and justice remain to be discovered in the State. This will end our search. Can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
I do not know how that can be accomplished. Nor do I want to understand justice at the expense of temperance. So please consider temperance first.
{{< /r >}}


## Temperance

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than courage. It is the controlling of certain pleasures and desires. This is implied in the praise saying 'a man being his own master.'

There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself'. It means that the master is also the servant and the servant is the master since the same person is denoted. <b>It really means that in the human soul there is a better and a worse principle.</b>

When the better principle is controlling the worse principle, then a man the master of himself. The better principle is also the smaller. Evil education or association causes the better principle to be overwhelmed by the worse principle. The man becomes "unprincipled" or the slave of the self.

Our newly-created State is a master of itself, if the words 'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better principle over the worse. The complex pleasures, desires, and pains are generally found in:
<ul>
  <li>children</li>
  <li>women</li>
  <li>servants</li>
  <li>freemen of the lowest and more numerous class.</li>
</ul>

Whereas the reasonable and moderate desires guided by true opinion are to be found only:
<ul>
  <li>in a few, and</li>
  <li>those the best born and best educated.</li>
</ul>

The meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few. Our city can be called "temperate" if it masters its own pleasures, desires, and masters itself. In such a state, the subjects agree to follow their rulers.

This means temperance will be both in the rulers and the subjects. Temperance is a sort of harmony, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom. Each of which resides in a part only.
<ul>
  <li>Wisdom makes the State wise.</li>
  <li>Courage makes the State valiant.</li>
  <li>Temperance extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale.</li>
</ul>

It produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else.

Temperance is the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior both in states and individuals.
<!-- We have discovered three out of the four virtues in our State.
The last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice.
We now hunt for this . 
I am a mere follower who just follows the hunter.So follow me hunt for it.-->
{{< /l >}}


## Justice

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
The last virtue is justice which we now hunt for. The hunting grounds are dark and perplexing. I perceived something so I tracked it. At the beginning of our enquiry, there was justice tumbling about at our feet yet we never saw her. We are like people who go about looking for what was already in their hands.
<!-- We have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her. -->

<b>The original principle at the foundation of the State is that one man should practise one thing only whatever his nature was best adapted to.</b> [svadharma]

Justice is this principle or a part of it. Justice was doing one's own business, and not being a busybody. So doing one's own business in a certain way is justice because this is the only virtue which remains when temperance, courage, and wisdom are abstracted. This is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all those other virtues. This is also their preservative.

If wisdom, courage, and temperance were discovered by us, justice would be the remaining one. It is not easy to answer which of these four virtues contributes most to the excellence of the State:
<ul>
  <li>the wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, [satya, svadhyaya]</li>
  <li>the temperance in the agreement of rulers and subjects, [asteya, brahmacarya, aparigraha]</li>
  <li>the courage of the soldiers in preserving the state, [santosa, iisvara</li>
  <li>the justice between children and women; slave, freeman, and artisan; ruler and subject, and the principle of every one doing his own work. [dharma, svadharma]</li>
</ul>

This last one is the correct answer. This means that the power of each individual in the State to do his own work competes with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, courage. The virtue which enters into this competition is justice.

The rulers in a State are entrusted to determine the suits at law. Suits are decided by the principle that a man may not take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own. Then justice is the having and doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him.

Suppose a carpenter is doing the business of a trader and a trader doing that of a carpenter. Suppose them to exchange their tools or their duties. This would not cause much harm to the State.

But if the trader's heart is lifted by wealth, strength, the number of his followers, or any like advantage, and he forces his way into the class of warriors, then this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the State.

This also happens when:
<ul>
  <li>warriors become legislators and guardians, for which he is unfitted,</li>
  <li>one man is a trader, legislator, and warrior all in one.</li>
</ul>

There are three distinct classes. Any meddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest harm to the State. It can be called evil-doing. 'Injustice' is the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city. On the other hand, justice is when the trader, auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business. It will make the city just. This idea of justice is verified both in the individual as well as in the State.

If we could examine justice on the larger scale, there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual level. That larger example was the State. Accordingly, we constructed as good a one as we could, knowing that the good State has justice.

Let our definition of justice be now applied to the individual. If they agree, we shall be satisfied. The friction of the person and the State when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth.
<!-- This vision will then fix in our souls. -->

When a small and a big thing is called by the same name, they become like each other. The just man will be like the just State.
A State is just when:
<ul>
  <li>its three classes did their own business, and</li>
  <li>were temperate, valiant, and wise.</li>
</ul>

A man is just when he has the same three virtues in his own soul. Thus, the soul does not have these virtues in the beginning. But we must acknowledge:
<ul>
  <li>that in each of us, there are the same virtues and habits that are in the State, and</li>
  <li>that from the individual they pass into the State.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Does the soul have these three virtues?

Adeimantus= No. The proverb holds that hard is the good.

Very true, Our current method is not enough to answer this question.

The true method is a longer one. -->
<!-- Take the quality of passion or spirit. It would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it. -->

The same may be said of:
<ul>
  <li>the love of knowledge (This is the special characteristic of us Greeks.)</li>
  <li>the love of money (This is the characteristic of the Thracians, Scythians, the northern nations, and the Phoenicians and Egyptians.)</li>
</ul>

But it is not so easy to know whether these principles are three or one. Do we learn through Part 1 of our nature, and get angry through Part 2, and develop natural appetites from Part 3?

Two contrary things cannot come from the same thing at the same time. Therefore, when this contradiction comes from sources apparently the same, then those sources are really different. 

For example, a thing cannot be at rest and in motion at the same time. Imagine a man who is standing but is also moving his hands. A person will say that he is in motion and at rest at the same time. 

Imagine a top that is spinning but is staying in one location. A person will say that the top is in motion and at rest at the same time.

We should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference. The axis stands still, but the circumference is in motion. But if the axis also moves, then the object is not at rest. This will prevent us from being confused.

The following are all opposites:
<ul>
  <li>assent and dissent,</li>
  <li>desire and aversion, and</li>
  <li>attraction and repulsion.</li>
</ul>

It does not matter whether they are active or passive since they oppose regardless.

The soul who desires is seeking after the object of his desire. The opposing lack of desire is in the class of repulsion and rejection. The object of hunger is food. The object of thirst is drink. Thirst is the desire of the soul to drink, and of drink only, unqualified by temperature, amount, or kind. If the desire is accompanied by cold, then it becomes a desire of warm drink. If the thirst be excessive, then the drink desired will be excessive. But pure and simple thirst will desire pure and simple drink. This is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger.
<!-- Let us create a class of desires, which have hunger and thirst as the most obvious of them. -->
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Yes, the simple desire is in every instance of the simple object. The qualified desire is in the case of qualified object.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
People will say that no man desires drink only, but good drink, or food only, but good food. Good is the universal object of desire. Thirst is a desire and will necessarily mean thirst for a good drink. The same is true of every other desire.

Nevertheless, I think that relatives will have some quality attached to the original word or the relation between the words. Simple words will have simple correlatives.
<ul>
  <li>"Greater" is related to "less".</li>
  <li>"Sometime greater" is related to "sometime less".</li>
  <li>"Greater to be" is related to "less that is to be".</li>
  <li>"More" is related to "less".</li>
  <li>"Double" is related to "half".</li>
  <li>"Heavier" is related to "lighter".</li>
  <li>"Swifter" is related to "slower".</li>
  <li>"Hot" is related to "cold".</li>
</ul>

The same principle holds in the sciences. The object of science is knowledge. But the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge. 

The science of house-building is a kind of knowledge different from other kinds. It is therefore called "architecture" because it has a particular quality which no other has. It has this particular quality because it has a particular object. This is true of the other arts and sciences.

Regarding relatives, if one word of a relation is taken alone, then the other is taken alone. If one term is qualified, the other is also qualified. But I do not mean to say:
<ul>
  <li>that relatives may not be disparate, or</li>
  <li>that the science of health is healthy, or</li>
  <li>that the science of disease is necessarily diseased, or</li>
  <li>that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil</li>
</ul>

I only mean that the word "science" is no longer used absolutely. Instead, it has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease. It becomes the "science of medicine" and not merely as "science".

Thirst is one of these essentially relative terms, having a relation to drink. A certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink.
But thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only. Thus, a thirsty soul desires only drink.

If something pulls a thirsty soul away from drink, then that something must be different from the thirst. A man might be thirsty but be unwilling to drink. A weaker part of his soul from passion is bidding a man to drink, and a stronger part from reason forbidding him.

<!--  because thirst cannot be contrary to itself and both create a desire and an aversion to drink. -->
<!-- Both hands of the archer do not push and pull the bow at the same time. Rather, one hand pulls and the other pushes.  -->
<!-- The latter is stronger than what bids him.
The forbidding principle is derived from reason.
The principle which bids and attracts comes from passion and disease. -->

These two are differerent from one another. The one with which a man reasons, we may call the "rational principle of the soul". The other, which drives him to love, hunger, thirst, and feel the flutterings of any other desire, can be called the "irrational" or appetitive. It is the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions. Passion or spirit is akin to desire.

Thus, the soul has two principles.

Leontius was the son of Aglaion. He came one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside. He heard of dead bodies at the place of execution. He wanted to see them, yet also dreaded and abhorred them. For a time, he struggled and covered his eyes. But finally, the desire got the better of him. He forced them open and ran up to the dead bodies, saying, "Look ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight". The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire, as though they were two distinct things.

There are few cases when a man's desires violently prevail over his reason. In those cases, he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him. This struggle is like the struggle of factions in a State. In this struggle, his spirit is on the side of his reason.

But no one has observed the passionate or spirited element join the desires when reason rules over them.

If a noble man has injured another, he will be less indignant in receiving physical suffering from the injured person in return. His anger is not excited by such suffering. But when a noble is injured, he gets angry. His suffering makes him determined at revenge. It makes him believe to be on the side of justice. His noble spirit will not be quelled until his reason-shepherd bids his passion-dog stop barking.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
So in our State, the auxiliaries are the dogs and the rulers are their shepherds. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Passion or spirit appeared initially to be a kind of desire. But now they are quite the contrary.

In the conflict of the soul, spirit is on the side of the rational principle. Does it mean that passion is different from reason? This is consistent with:
<ul>
  <li>our State being composed of three classes= traders, auxiliaries, counsellors.</li>
  <li>being different from desire and reason.</li>
</ul>

Or is passion a kind of reason? In this case, the soul will have two principles, the rational and the lustful, instead of three.
<!-- This would mean that in a soul, there is not a third element of passion or spirit. -->

Passion is suppposed to be the natural auxiliary of reason when reason is corrupted by bad education. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
Passion is different from reason as proven by young children being full of spirit as soon as they are born. Some children never attain to the use of reason. Most of them acquire it later.
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Excellent. Passion is equally seen in animals. Homer writes:
{{< /l >}}


{{< quote >}} 
"He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul."
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Homer clearly shows that reason is different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it. And so, we have agreed that:
<ul>
  <li>the same virtues which exist in the State exist also in the individual, and</li>
  <li>that they are three in number= wisdom, courage, temperance.</li>
</ul>

We must infer that the individual and State is wise in the same way.

The same quality which constitutes courage in the State constitutes courage in the individual.
Both the State and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues.
The individual is just in the same way that the State is just.
The justice of the State consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class.
The individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work.
The rational principle is wisdom.

It has the care of the whole soul. It should rule. The passionate or spirited principle is its subject and ally. The united influence of music and gymnastics will bring reason and passion into accord by:
<ul>
  <li>nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons,</li>
  <li>moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm.</li>
</ul>

When reason and passion are nurtured, educated, and have truly learned their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent. In each of us, this is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain. They will keep guard of this lest the bodily pleasures empower the concupiscent soul and enslaves those who are not her natural-born subjects and overturn one's whole life. They together will be the best defenders of the whole soul and body against external attacks.
Reason counsels and passion fights, executing the commands and counsels or reason.

A courageous person is one whose spirit retains the commands of reason on what he should fear or not fear. A wise person is one who has reason with the knowledge of what is for the interest of desire, reason, and passion. A temperate person is one who has these three elements in friendly harmony and has reason as the ruling principle for desire and passion. We have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just.

Is justice dimmer and different in the individual than in the State? 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
A few common instances shows that they are different. A just state:
<ul>
  <li>avoids stealing money in the same way that a just man does</li>
  <li>avoids treachery to other states in the same way that a just citizen avoids it to his friends</li>
  <li>never breaks faith in oaths or agreements in the same way that a just citizen keeps his oaths.</li>
</ul>
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Then our dream has been realized. In the beginning, we suspected that some divine power conducted us to a primary form of justice. We have now verified it.

The division of labour which required the carpenter, the shoemaker, and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice. But in reality, justice was concerned not with the outward man, but with the inward or the true self. [svadharma]

<b>The just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do the work of others. He sets his own inner life in order. He masters himself with his own law, to be at peace with himself.</b>

The three principles of animal-desire, passion, and reason may be compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals. When he has bound together these notes and intervals, they are no longer many. They become one, entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature.

He then proceeds to act in law, medicine, politics or private business. He calls= <!-- that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition as= -->
<ul>
  <li>"just and good action" if they are from knowledge and wisdom</li>
  <li>"unjust action" if they impair this knowledge and wisdom</li>
  <li>"ignorance" the opinion which presides over the unjust action.</li>
</ul>
{{< /l >}}


### Injustice

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
Injustice is a strife between the three principles which leads to the vices of intemperance, cowardice, and ignorance. It begins when one principle rebels against the others, causing the confusion and delusion of injustice.

<!-- —a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural vassal, —what is all this , and , and every form of vice? -->

<!-- If the nature of justice and injustice are known, then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust will also be perfectly clear. -->

Justice and injustice are like health and disease. These lie in the soul just as health and disease lie in the body.
<ul>
  <li>Healthy things cause health.</li>
  <li>Unhealthy things cause disease.</li>
  <li>Just actions cause justice.</li>
  <li>Unjust actions cause injustice.</li>
  <li>The creation of health is the institution of a natural order of one by another in the parts of the body.</li>
  <li>The creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order.</li>
  <li>The creation of justice is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul.</li>
</ul>

When things go against the natural order of things, injustice [adharma] is created. This means that:
<ul>
  <li>virtue is the health, beauty, and well-being of the soul</li>
  <li>vice is its disease, weakness, and deformity.</li>
  <li>good practices lead to virtue</li>
  <li>evil practices lead to vice.</li>
</ul>

Is it more profitable to act justly whether seen or unseen, or to act unjustly as long as it is unseen and unpunished? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Glaucon" >}}
This question is ridiculous. When the body is gone, it does not matter whether the soul is pampered with meat, drink, wealth, and power. <!-- state's constitution is gone, life ends. When the essence of the soul's vital principle is corrupted, only the soul who wants to do whatever he likes, without any regard for justice and virtue, would want to live again. --> 
{{< /l >}}

{{< l a="Socrates" >}}
From above, we might see that virtue is one, but vices are many and are of four kinds, just as there are five types of the State and five types of the soul. The just state has two names= 
<ul>
  <li>Monarchy - This is rule exercised by one distinguished man</li>
  <li>Aristocracy - This is rule exercised by distinguished men.</li>
</ul>
