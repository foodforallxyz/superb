Hainan is the Chu-ai and Tan-ir of the Han period.

When the Emperor Wu-ti (BC 140-86) 86) had made the conquest of Southern Yue, he sent a mission from Suwon across the sea to reconnoitre Hainan. 

As a consequence, the 2 perfectures of Chu-ai and Tan-ir were established. 

His successor Chau-ti (BC ) 

and incorporated
it
in Chu-ai.
On
the advice of Kia Kiian-chi
the Emperor abandoned Chu-ai, and
Liang (502—527)
C. 86—73) dropped Tan-ir
two prefectures
it

was only again occupied in 589—618

In 627 Hainan was divided into 3 departments

- Ai
- Tan
- Chon

They were attached to the province of Ling-nan. 

In 631, Kiung shan in Ai was made a prefecture. Wananhien was raised to departmental rank, identical with the military districts of today.

Its products are also found in foreign lands. The difference is in their quality.

Its gharu-wood from Kiung far surpass those from foreign lands by the quality and strength of their perfume. 

Those from South Vietnam and Chonla India are not to be compared with them. 

On the other hand, Hainan's yellow wax is nothing compared to that of Sumatra. It is even inferior to that of the Visayas. 

Its other prodcts are mostly like those of foreign lands, with the exception of betel-nuts
and cotton which are extraordinarily plentiful. 

The Cantonese traders look principally to cotton as a profitable article.
