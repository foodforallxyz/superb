In a previous passage (supra, p. 156), our author mentions four varieties of camphor as

5 comes from Fo-ta-ni ('^

from the Laurus camphora) which comes from Shau-chou (^^
in Kuang-tung); hence its
name of shau-naun. In northern China camphor is usually called ch'au-nau (iM B^) from Ch'au-
ch6u, also in Kuang-tung, and not far distant from Shau-chou. This latter name ck'.au-nau must
be the correct form. See also Bretschneider, Botanicon Sinicum, 346 (J. 0. B. K. A. S., XXV).
10 Linschoten, Voyage to the East Indies, II, 118 (Hakl. Soc. edit.) remarks that one pound of
Borneo camphor was worth one hundred pounds of Chin-cheu (i. e., Chinese) camphor.

much used by the Sumatrans
It is rather a liquid and volatile resin, distilling from one
species of the camphire tree, without any oleaginous quality».
15
Our author states (supra, p. 67) that camphor was also a product of Tan-ma-ling, of Java
(p. 77), and of Ling-ya-ssi-kia (p. 68) Chou K'ii-fei adds Chu-lien. See supra, p, 100, n.

At the present time the best myrrh comes from the Somali country near Harar. The myrrh which
is got from the hills about Shugra and Sureea to the east of Aden (which must have been included
25 in Merbat as Chinese understood it) is of an inferior quality. See Encyclopaedia Britannica

The present day su-ho-Uang-yu or «sweet oil of storax», or su-ho-yu nstorax oil», which
occurs in commerce in China, is a product of the Liquidambar orientalis, L., of Asia Minor. The

era as
a product of Ta-ts'in, and the name of which OTupa?, they may have mutilated into su-ho, was

Apparently the storax sent to
China in those early days was very largely adulterated, for Liang-shu, 54,i7», (covering
the first half
of the sixth century), says that in Western Asia (Ta-ts'in) astorax (su-ho) is
made by mixing and
boiling the juice of various fragrant trees
and that it is not a natural product. It is further said that
the inhabitants of Ta-ts'in gatherjhe su-Jio (plant, or parts of it), squeeze out its
juice, and thus
