The Arabs are to the very far northwest of Guangzhou. This makes it hard for foreign ships to trade to it directly. 

After these ships have left Guangzhou, they arrive in Srilanka after 40 days to to trade. The next year, they go out to sea again and make the journey in 60 days in regular wind.

Their products are brought to Palembang Sumatra where they are forwarded by merchants to China. 

Arabia is powerful and warlike. Its area is very large. Its inhabitants are pre-eminent among all foreigners for their distinguished bearing.

The climate is mostly cold with snow falling to 2-3 feet. This makes rugs valuable. 

Its capital is Misuli (some make it to be Malopa), an important trade center for foreigners. 

The king wears a turban of silk brocade and foreign cotton.

On each new moon and full moon, he puts on an eight-sided flat-topped headdress of pure gold, set with the most precious jewels in the world. His robe is of sik brocade and is bound around him with a jade girdle. 

He wears golden shoes. His residence has:
- pillars of cornelian stone
- walls of lu-kan stone (It is as transparent as crystal)
- tiles of rock-crystal
- bricks of green stone (jasper?)
- mortar of huo stone
- curtains and screens of brocade with rich designs woven in all kinds of colour in silk and pure gold thread.


The king's throne is set with pearls and precious stones.
- The steps of the throne are covered with pure gold.
- The vessels and utensils around the throne are of gold or silver
- Precious pearls are knotted in the screen behind it.
  - In great court ceremonies, the king sits behind this.
  - On either side, the ministers of state surround him, protecting him. They bear golden bucklersand helmets and armed with precious swords.

His other officers are called Tai-wei. 
- Each of them command 20,000 horsemen.
- The horses are 7 feet high and are shod with iron.
- His army is brave and excels in all military exercises.

The streets of the capital are over 50 feet wide. These have sidewalks paved with green and black flagstones of surpassing beauty. These are for the convenience of the pedestrians' business.
- In the middle is a roadway 20 feet wide for camels, horses, and oxen carrying goods about. 


The houses are like those of the Chinese, except that they use thin flagstones instead of tiles.

Their food consists of:
- rice and other cereals.

This country was originally a branch of the Persians. Around 605-617, a high-minded and wise Persian found a stone in a deep hole bearing an inscription, and this he took for a good omen. 

So he got the people together, took weapons by force and enrolled followers, increased in number until he became powerful enough to make himself king. He then conquered Western Possi.

Since 650-656, they have come repeatedly to our Court to present tribute.

tribute to our Court.

In 971, they sent presents with South Vietnam and Java to Li Yu in Kiang-nan. Yu did not go to accept them, so the envoys submitted the matter to the Court, and an Order
in Council was issued forbidding that
tribute presents should
henceforth be brought.

In 993, they sent tribute through the Assistant Envoy Liawu who stated, at an audience granted him in the Ch'ung-chong Audience Hall (of the Palace), that his
country bordered on Baghdad and that it produced ivory and rhinoceros horns.

The Emperor Taitsung asked him how rhinoceros and elephants were captured.

He replied= To capture elephants, we use decoy elephants to get near them. We then catch them with a big lasso. To
bow and arrow

To capture a rhinoceros, a man with a big bow and arrow climbs a big tree, where he shoots it.  The young rhinoceros are not shot as they can be caught.

The envoy was presented with a court dress, a hat and girdle, and, besides these, with as much gold as the tribute presents were worth

In 986, Arab envoys came to Court with a mission from the Pintunglung country. 

In 1003, they sent Mani and others a tribute of pearls and a request that return presents should
not be made them. 

Nevertheless, Emperor Chon-tsung gave them  extraordinary honours before returning home.

In 1004, the Arab envoy remained behind at the capital, together with the envoys from Sumatra, and Pukan, to celebrate the Feast of Lanterns where they were treated to their heart's content with money and wine. 

In 1007, they accompanied a tribute mission from Southern Vietnam and were treated with most particular attention,. They were allowed to visit the Buddhist and Taoist temples and  the Imperial gardens and parks.

again, and was ordered by the Emperor to follow the Court.

In 1086-1094 and 1205-1208, the Arabs sent missions to Court with tribute.

An Arab trader named of Shi-na-wei, living in Canton disdained wealth, but was charitable and filled with Arabian spirit. 

He built a charnel house in the south-western corner of the suburb as a last resting-place for the abandoned bodies of foreign traders.

The Customs Inspector Lin Chiki has recorded this.

Bretschneider, Ancient Chinese and Arabs,
15, referring to this mission (he puts it in 1004, and gives the name of the envoy as Po-kin-lo-san-
mo-ni), is of opinion that the last three sounds of this name indicate an allusion to the Arabian
dynasty of the Samanides, who reigned till the beginning of the eleventh century in the East and
30 had their capital in Bokhara. Chavannes, Le Nestorianisme, 38, 40—41, says of the word

Ma-(or Mo-)ni (

Mo-ni has been sometimes
used, erroneously, by tho

Mecca can be reached by 80 days land westward travel from Basra (Malopa). 

This is where Mohammad was born. In the house of God, the walls are made of precious stones of every colour. 

During the death anniversary of Mohammad, all the Arabs gather here where they bring presents of gold, silver, jewels and precious stones. Then the House is adorned anew with silk brocade.

## 24. Bandar Abbas (Tsongpa)


Bandar Abbas is on an island of the sea south of Gujarat. It has a great mountain to the West.

The Arabs wrap themselves in blue foreign cotton stuffs  and wear red leather shoes. 

Their daily food consists of meal, baked cakes and mutton.

There are many villages, and a succession of wooded hills and terraced rocks. 

The climate is warm, and there is no cold season.


Their exports are:
- elephants' tusks
- native gold
- ambergris
- yellow sandal-wood

Every year, Gujarat and the Arabs send ships to trade here with:

- white cotton cloth
- porcelain
- copper
- red cotton
