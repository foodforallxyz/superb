<!-- I have presented the current state of our historical knowledge concerning the dynamics of the distribution of wealth and income since the eighteenth century, and I have attempted to draw from this knowledge whatever lessons can be drawn for the century ahead.

The sources on which this book draws are more extensive than any previous author has assembled, but they remain imperfect and incomplete. All of my conclusions are by nature tenuous and deserve to be questioned and debated. It is not the purpose of social science research to produce mathematical certainties that can substitute for open, democratic debate in which all shades of opinion are represented. -->

## The Central Contradiction of Capitalism

The Central Contradiction of Capitalism is:

`r > g`


A market economy based on private property, if left to itself, contains powerful forces of convergence, associated in particular with the diffusion of knowledge and skills. It also contains powerful forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to= 
- democratic societies 
- the values of social justice on which they are based.

The principal destabilizing force is rate of return on private capital `r` being significantly higher for long periods than the rate of growth of income and output `g`.

The inequality `r > g` implies that wealth accumulated in the past grows more rapidly than output and wages. 
- This inequality is a fundamental logical contradiction. 

It turns the entrepreneur into a rentier, more and more dominant over the workers. Once constituted, capital reproduces itself faster than the increase in output. The past devours the future.

The consequences for the long-term dynamics of the wealth distribution are potentially terrifying. This is especially true since= 
- the return on capital varies directly with the initial size of capital
- this divergence in the wealth distribution is occurring on a global scale

The problem is enormous, and there is no simple solution. Growth can be encouraged by investing in education, knowledge, and nonpolluting technologies. But none of these will raise the growth rate to 4-5% a year. 

Only the countries that are catching up with more advanced economies can grow at such rates. Examples are= 
- Europe during the three decades after World War II
- China and other emerging countries  

<!-- For countries at the world technological frontier—and thus ultimately for the planet as a whole—there is ample reason to believe that the  -->

The natural growth rate <!-- for backward countries, and --> for backward countries, and the planet as a whole, will not exceed 1–1.5% in the long run, no matter what economic policies are adopted.

If the average return on capital of 4–5%, then `r > g` will again become the norm in the 21st century. This is the same as just before World War I. 

In the 20th century, <!-- , as it had been throughout history until the eve of . In the twentieth century --> it took two world wars to wipe away the past and significantly reduce the return on capital. It created the illusion that the fundamental structural contradiction of capitalism `r > g` had been overcome.

Capital income can be taxed heavily to reduce the private return on capital to be less than the growth rate. But this might <!-- But if one did that indiscriminately and heavy-handedly, one would risk --> kill the motor of accumulation and thus further reduce the growth rate. There would no longer be any entrepreneurs who might become <!-- would then no longer have the time to turn into --> rentiers. <!-- , since there would be no more entrepreneurs. -->

**The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital*.** 



This will prevent an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation. 

For example, a capital tax schedule with rates of= 
- 0.1% on fortunes under 1m euros
- 1% fortunes between 1-5m euros
- 2% between 5-10m euros
- 5-10% for fortunes of several hundred million euros

This would contain the unlimited growth of global inequality of wealth. <!-- , which is currently increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained in the long run and that ought to worry even the most fervent champions of the self-regulated market. -->  <!-- Historical experience shows, moreover, that such immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial spirit and are of no use in promoting growth. Nor are they of any “common utility,” to borrow the nice expression from the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen with which I began this book. --> This progressive tax on capital will require a high level of international cooperation and regional political integration. Nation-states cannot do this alone. 

People fear that such political integration= 
- will undermine the existing achievements of welfare states [that already have high taxation]
- will only really just create more competition even if such competition cannot change inequality `r > g` since this inequality is not caused by imperfect competition

<!-- It is not within the reach of the nation-states in which earlier social compromises were hammered out. Many people worry that moving toward greater cooperation and political integration within, say, the European Union only undermines existing achievements (starting with the social states that the various countries of Europe constructed in response to the shocks of the twentieth century) without constructing anything new other than a vast market predicated on ever purer and more perfect competition.  -->

<!-- Yet pure and perfect competition cannot alter the inequality r > g, which is not the consequence of any market “imperfection.” On the contrary. Although the risk is real, I do not see any genuine  -->

But we have no choice. If the people are to regain control of capitalism, we must bet everything on a large-scale democracy. 

<!-- —and in Europe, democracy on a European scale.  -->

Larger political communities such as the United States and China have more options. But small European countries who leave the EU will just have even worse frustration and disappointment.

<!--  national withdrawal can only lead to  than currently exists with the European Union.  -->

<!-- The nation-state is still the right level at which to modernize any number of social and fiscal policies and to develop new forms of governance and shared ownership intermediate between public and private ownership, which is one of the major challenges for the century ahead. But  -->

Only regional political integration can lead to effective regulation of the globalized patrimonial 21st century capitalism.

<!-- For a Political and Historical Economics

I would like to conclude with a few words about economics and social science. As I made clear in the introduction, I see  -->

Economics is a subdiscipline of the social sciences. It is alongside= 
- history
- sociology
- anthropology
- political science

<!-- I hope that this book has given the reader an idea of what I mean by that. --> 

The expression “economic science” is terribly arrogant because it suggests that economics has attained a higher scientific status than the other social sciences. It is better to call it “political economy”. This name sets it apart from <!-- I much prefer the expression  which may seem rather old-fashioned but to my mind conveys the only thing that sets economics apart --> the other social sciences because of its political, normative, and moral purpose.

Political economy studied the ideal role of the state in the economic and social organization of a country. It asked what public policies and institutions bring us closer to an ideal society.

<!--  sought to study scientifically, or at any rate rationally, systematically, and methodically, the ideal role of .  -->

<!-- This unabashed aspiration to study good and evil, about which every citizen is an expert, may make some readers smile. To be sure, it is an aspiration that often goes unfulfilled. But it is also a necessary, indeed indispensable, goal, because it is all too easy for social scientists to remove themselves from public debate and political confrontation and content themselves with the role of commentators on or demolishers of the views and data of others.  -->

Social scientists, like all intellectuals and citizens, should participate in public debate. 
- They should not just invoke grand but abstract principles of justice, democracy, and world peace. 
- They must make choices and take stands in regard to specific institutions and policies, whether it be= 
  - the social state
  - the tax system, or
  - the public debt.

Everyone is political in his or her own way. The world is not divided between= 
- a political elite on one side
- an army of voters and spectators whose only responsibility is to vote once every four or five years. 

The scholar and the citizen do not live in separate moral universes. This separation is dangerous.  <!-- , the former concerned with means and the latter with ends. Although comprehensible, this view ultimately strikes me as dangerous. -->

For too long, economists used <!-- have sought to define themselves in terms of their --> supposedly scientific methods which <!-- In fact, those methods --> rely on an immoderate use of mathematical models which are merely<!--  frequently no more than --> an excuse for occupying the terrain and masking the vacuity of the content. 

Too much energy <!-- has been and still --> is being wasted on pure theoretical speculation without a clear specification of the economic facts.<!--  one is trying to explain or the social and political problems one is trying to resolve.  --> Economists today <!-- are full of enthusiasm for --> rely on empirical methods based on controlled experiments. 

When used with moderation, these methods can be useful, and they deserve credit for turning some economists toward concrete questions and firsthand knowledge of the terrain <!-- (a long overdue development) -->. 

But these new approaches themselves succumb at times to a certain scientistic illusion. 

It is possible, for instance, to spend a lot of time proving the existence of a pure and true causal relation for a useless question. <!-- while forgetting that the question itself is of limited interest.  -->

The new methods often neglects history<!--  and of the fact that historical experience remains our principal source of knowledge -->.  We cannot replay the history of the 20th century as if World War I never happened<!--  or as if the income tax and PAYGO pensions were never created -->. <!-- To be sure, historical causality is always difficult to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.  --> Did a particular policy lead to a particular effect? Or was that effect due to some other cause? 

<!-- Nevertheless, the imperfect lessons that we can draw from history, and in particular from the study of the last century, are of inestimable, irreplaceable value.  -->

No controlled experiment will ever be able to equal the historical lessons. To be useful, economists must <!-- above all learn to be more pragmatic in their methodological choices, to make use of whatever tools are available, and thus to --> work more closely with other social science disciplines. Conversely, social scientists in other disciplines should not leave the study of economic facts to economists. They  must not flee <!-- in horror the minute -->  when a number rears its head, or content themselves with saying that every statistic is a social construct, which of course is true but insufficient. 

In the end, both responses are the same, because they abandon the terrain to others.


## The Interests of the Least Well-Off

{{< q >}}
As long as the incomes of the various classes in society remain beyond the reach of scientific inquiry, there is no hope of producing a useful economic and social history.
<cite>Le mouvement du profit en France au 19e siècle, Jean Bouvier, François Furet, and Marcel Gillet 1965</cite>
{{< /q >}}

That French book <!-- admirable sentence begins . The book is still worth reading, in part because it --> is a good example of the “serial history” that flourished in France between 1930 and 1980, with its characteristic virtues and flaws. It shows the intellectual trajectory of François Furet and explains why his research program eventually died out.

Furet's topic as a historian was <!-- began his career as a promising young historian, he chose a subject that he believed was at the center of contemporary research=  --> “the incomes of the various classes of contemporary society.” 

The book is rigorous, eschews all prejudgment, and seeks above all to collect data and establish facts. Yet this would be Furet’s first and last work in this realm. 

<!-- In the splendid book he published with Jacques Ozouf in 1977, Lire et écrire, devoted to “literacy in France from Calvin to Jules Ferry,” one finds the same eagerness to compile serial data, no longer about industrial profits but now about literacy rates, numbers of teachers, and educational expenditures.  -->

Furet tried in vain to <!--  became famous for his work on the political and cultural history of the French Revolution, in which one endeavors in vain --> find any trace of the “incomes of the various classes of contemporary society” during the French Revolution because he turned against economic and social history of any kind.

<!--  and in which the great historian, preoccupied as he was in the 1970s with the battle he was waging against the Marxist historians of the French Revolution (who at the time were particularly dogmatic and clearly dominant, notably at the Sorbonne), seems to have turned against   -->

This is a pity, since I believe it is possible to reconcile the different approaches. 

Politics and ideas exist independently of economic and social evolutions. Marxist intellectuals denounced the laws from what they call the bourgeois institutions.

<!-- Parliamentary institutions and the government of laws were never merely the bourgeois institutions that Marxist intellectuals used to denounce before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  -->

Yet the ups and downs of prices and wages, incomes and fortunes, help to shape political institutions which then create the ups and downs of prices and wages, incomes and fortunes.

<!-- perceptions and attitudes. In return, these shape representations engender political institutions, rules, and policies that ultimately shape social and economic change -->

It is possible<!-- , and even indispensable, --> to have an approach that is both= 
- economic and political
- social and cultural
- concerned with wages and wealth. 

The bipolar confrontations from 1917–1989 as communism versus capitalism are now over. They sterilized instead of  stimulating research on capital and inequality by historians, economists, and even philosophers.2 

<!-- It is long since time to move beyond these old controversies and the historical research they engendered, which to my mind still bears their stamp. -->


The premature death of serial history had technical reasons= 
- The material difficulty of collecting and processing large volumes of data in those days<!--  probably explains why works in this genre (including Le mouvement du profit en France au 19e siècle) had little room for historical interpretation, which makes reading them rather arid.  -->
- there is often very little analysis of the relation between observed economic changes and the political and social history of the period under study. Instead, one gets a meticulous description of the sources and raw data, information that is more naturally presented nowadays in spreadsheets and online databases.

- the research program petered out before it reached the 20th century. 

In studying the 18th or 19th centuries, it is possible to think that the evolution of prices and wages, or incomes and wealth, obeys an autonomous economic logic having little or nothing to do with the logic of politics or culture. 

When one studies the 20th century, however, such an illusion falls apart immediately. A quick glance at the curves describing income and wealth inequality or the capital/income ratio is enough to show that politics is ubiquitous and that economic and political changes are inextricably intertwined and must be studied together. 

This forces one to study the state, taxes, and debt in concrete ways and to abandon simplistic and abstract notions of the economic infrastructure and political superstructure.

The principle of specialization is sound and surely makes it legitimate for some scholars to do research that does not depend on statistical series. There are a thousand and one ways to do social science, and accumulating data is not always indispensable or even (I concede) especially imaginative. 

Yet it seems to me that all social scientists, all journalists and commentators, all activists in the unions and in politics of whatever stripe, and especially all citizens should take a serious interest in money, its measurement, the facts surrounding it, and its history.

Those who have a lot of it never fail to defend their interests. Refusing to deal with numbers rarely serves the interests of the least well-off.
