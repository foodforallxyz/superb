The previous chapter explained that the Creator of the universe created the universe from Its Own metaphysical ideas and feelings, just as a novelist writes a novel from a stream of ideas and feelings coming from his metaphysical mind. 

The purpose of ideas is to create experience. 

However, experience can only exist if there is an experiencer. Thus, there are only two things in this 'matrix' of Existence: 
- the experiencer
- the experience of ideas and feelings


## The Positive and Negative Forces

Before existence began, the Absolute Creator had nothing to create those experiencers and experiences. And so It created those from Itself, using 2 forces*:
- the positive (this is known as Shiva in Hinduism or Yang in Chinese)
- the negative (this is known as Shakti in Hinduism or Yin in Chinese)

{{< img src="/icons/tao.png" size="" alt="The Tao">}}



> Some Taoist schools say that it does not matter whether the Yin-Yang symbol is shown in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. We say that it *does* matter. The symbol should always be in a counterclockwise direction, as shown in the ba-gua. Moreover, Yang should always be on top as implied by the Tao-te-Ching. <p> This is because, from the Metaphyics of Things, ideas have a shape which implies a proper orientation (right-side up). An idea can be learned or a problem can be solved faster by approaching the idea or problem <b>at the right angle that matches its orientation</b>. This is similar to a spaceshuttle re-entering earth at a proper angle to avoid burning up*. Without the knowledge of this shape, the only alternative is to approach it from all possible angles, leading to a waste of time and effort. Some problems are so complex that the proper angle is hard to achieve with the hit-or-miss approach. This is why Superphysics will be able to solve problems, even the complex ones, faster*** than Science that has no concept of the geometry of ideas**</p>


> *This angle and shape is a consequence of the Negative force which surrounds each idea or identity as to separate it from other identities


> **Plato alludes to this through the five Platonic shapes. Superphysics visualizes these through the Aethereal Cartesian plane which will be done by machine learning, since it's too complicated for a human 

> ***We actually use this technique to come up with solutions to economic crises and social crises faster than Economists or Sociologists. The problem is in implementing those solutions in the physical real world because of the static 'aether-drag' in human minds   



### Duality from the Two Forces

The Negative force splits the Absolute into a dualistic Creator, as the Supreme, which makes imperfections of Itself, as Its dualistic ideas and feelings:
- The creation of the idea of beauty also leads to the creation of ugliness. 
- The creation of order also leads to the creation of disorder. 
- The creation of tastiness also leads to the creation of blandness.


{{< q a="" >}}
Since the One exists, then the Whole has the One and Existence as Its parts. Each of these parts have both the One and Existence as its parts and is at the least made up of two parts. The same principle goes on forever. Every part always has these two parts because existence always involves one, and one involves being, so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two. This makes the One infinite in multiplicity. The One has Existence and therefore exists, leading it to become many.<cite>Simplified Parmenides by Plato</cite>
{{< /q >}}


These ideas and feelings are then experienced in the physical domain, as physicalized versions, by The Supreme as the Experiencer through the Positive Force.

This closes the loop between Experiencer and Experience and justifies Existence.

Thus:
- The Negative Force separates and creates ignorance
- The Positive Force unites and creates knowledge

The Great passes on in constant flow. Passing on, it becomes remote.  Having become remote, it returns.

The physicalized versions of metaphysical ideas are the physical expression of those ideas. <!-- Since ideas and feelings exist before their physical counterparts, we can say that the latter are expressions of such ideas.  --> For example, a tasty dish is an expression or manifestation of the idea of tastiness. 
- The cook had a metaphysical idea for a tasty dish and so he created a tasty dish in reality.
- This tastiness is proven after he tastes it and is experiened by his mind.
- This **closes the loop** from his mind creating an idea of a tasty dish to his mind actually experiencing a tasty dish.
- The match of idea and experience then forms his truth: "Yum! It really, truthfully was a tasty dish."

In the same way, the universe exists because the Creator had an idea to create it. Our experiences of the universe is part of the loop-closings that verify or give truth to Creator's ideas. This loop began with the creation of the universe and is closed with our experiences of it. 

The Creator might have had an idea of a car. So It creates a Big Bang, then planets, then minerals, then humans, then inventors, then  manufacturers to finally have a physical car to be validated by a conscious being such as a human to close the loop. 

<!-- Everything that we perceive in the universe therefore is an expression of the latent ideas of the Creator that It makes from Itself. 

The Creator had an idea of tastiness among Its infinite ideas. So It created the universe, via a 'Big Bang' to create stars that created matter that led to life that led to humans who could cook a delicious dish which was completed when it was actually tasted by someone who validated the idea by saying "Yum!". 
 -->

The timespan from the Big Bang to the actual riding of the car might take billions of years from our perspective. But since time is a product of the Creator, then It is not bound by that time. To It, the closing of the loop from the idea of the car to the experience of the car is instantaneous.
