"Then," you ask, "do you mean to tell us that THE ALL is LIFE and MIND?" 
<br/>
Yes! and No! is our answer.

The [previous post](/superphysics/principles/idea) talked about ideas and feelings as making up experience. But what about the experiencer or the mind that experiences those ideas and feelings? 

<!-- So far, the matrix of existence has two aspects:
- metaphysical
- physical

The contents of this matrix are only:
- experiencer
- experience (as ideas and feelings) -->

For the Experiencer to actually experience the infinite combination of ideas and feelings, It needs a container for them. This metaphysical container or arena is called a mind which is designed to hold and process Its Own ideas and feelings, which are collectively called 'perceptions'.

Thus, an experiencer has two parts:
- mind as the container for experiences
- consciousness as the perceiver of that container

Minds are then classified into two:

- A mind that can do its own actions or expressions is called a 'living thing' by humans
- A mind that cannot express nor act is called a 'non-living thing'


{{< img src="/graphics/meta/mind.png" alt="Living and non-living mind" cap="A living thing has a mind that can accept external feelings and ideas and likewise express them. A non-living thing cannot, due to the confinement by the Negative Force" >}}


'Life' therefore is an expressive mind that inhabits a physical body. A 'soul', then, is such a mind that exists independent of a body. 

A 'virus' is in-between a non-living idea and a living or expressive mind, that manifests as DNA or RNA. It has to use living things to spread itself as its means of expression or action. 

From the viewpoint of the Creator, the DNA of viruses and bacteria are simple ideas, while the souls of humans and cats are complex ideas. But from the viewpoint of viruses and bacteria, they themselves are minds, just as cats and dogs are see themselves as minds (cause) and not as ideas (effect). Likewise, we see ourselves as the cause of our own actions instead of being the effect of the Creator (working through us).

This independence of the minds of bacteria, cats, dogs, and humans from each other then implies that they have their own innate and unique expressions and experiences different from those of others. Otherwise, they would just be one entity and not separate entities.

Of which individual then will this be the substance?  Either of all or of none. But it cannot be the substance of all. If it is to be the substance of one, this one will be the others also.

This innate uniqeness to experience and express Existence is an identity's dharma or tao. Socrates calls this <!-- innate need and design --> as a thing's 'True Nature'*.


> *The English word 'Nature' is ambiguous and so we use 'Dharma' instead to specify the True Nature passively, and Tao to specify It actively  


## Morality is Always Relative

Good and evil then is how this need is protected or destroyed. Thus, morality, or the perception of good and bad, depends on two things:

- the nature of object
- the nature of the experiencers of the object 

This is why morality is always relative and changing. One society might feel that it is moral to be liberal, while another will feel that liberality is immoral and that conservatism is moral. 


<!-- In Tantra Yoga, the Supreme Entity merely exists alone, without space nor time. Since a thing exists only if it is perceived, then as an absolute entity, the Supreme Entity technically did not exist and did not have value because It was alone.

To solve this problem, It made perceivers of Itself from Itself (since there was nothing else). In other words, It split Itself into infinite entities, both conscious and unconscious.

The original substance of these entities is called Shiva and the force that splits it up is called Shakti. The original form is called Nirguna Brahma and the resultant form is called Saguna Brahma or the entire observable universe and multiverses.

Since existence was created for the Creator and not the ‘createes’ then by default all existing entities feel an urge to know the Creator. The deepest and most lasting happiness is achieved when it is related to the Creator. This is generally called spirituality. The process for achieving this happiness is called yoga, which aims to unify the createe (soul) with the Creator (pure consciousness). The exact state of union is called samadhi. -->

<!-- Since everything in existence is from the ideas of the Creator of existence, then dharma and morals can be properly attributed to It. -->


<!-- Ideas are static metaphysical objects carved out of the infinity of possible objects. Instead of mass, ideas use probability and all ideas have an equal probability. Even consciousness is an idea. It is its starting point in the physical dimension that makes the difference. For example, if Covid started in Antartica then it would be an insignificant idea. If a galaxy started in an energy-less part of the universe, then it would be insignificant as well. So the idea that supports Covid is its RNA, just as the idea supporting a galaxy is its supermassive black hole and there is no need for dark matter and that's why they will never find it no matter how many MIT or Berkley geniuses they throw at it. -->


Our solution to differences in moral standards is to get as many feelings as possible and then get the lowest-common-denominator-feeling that can serve as the base of a universal moral system.
