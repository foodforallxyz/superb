Our proposed moral system, derived from Adam Smith, David Hume, and Socrates, is based on a clear definition of morality as happiness for the most entities possible for the longest time possible.

The "most entities possible" encompasses moral space, while "for the longest time possible" encompasses moral time. The end goal of maximizing moral space and time, by specifying "most" and "longest", is the attainment of the state of peace. This ultimate state then answers the purpose of creation and closes the loop of existence. In eastern philosophy, this state is attained in an experience called samadhi, which cancels out both the ego and mind in order to remove the illusion imposed by Nature.

With the goal defined, the next step is to explain the mechanism that our moral system uses to attain that goal. Since we want an effect of maximum long term happiness for all, then we can apply dialectics to trace the different root causes of such happiness, and even the causes of unhappiness in order to avoid them. We follow the advice of Socrates to start with the big picture, then drill down to the individual implementations or cases. We will logically find that all suffering and unhappiness is caused by excessive ego or the feeling of the self:

The holocaust was caused by Nazi ego, not feeling for the Jews
The Mongol conquest and the resulting Black Death was caused by the ego of the Mongols
World War I was caused by German ego
The conquest by Japan in World War II was caused by the ego of the Japanese imperial government
