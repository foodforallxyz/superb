The question 'Does God exist?' can be answered by 'Can you perceive Existence?'. 

![Outer space](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/photos/space.jpg)

Earlier, we said that:
- every physical perception has a metaphysical idea-equivalent
- each idea produces an opposite idea: beauty has ugliness, health has disease
- a mind is an arena to experience such perceptions and ideas
- all our minds are inside a larger mind which we call the Matrix and is roughly equivalent to the Brahma by the Hindus, the Tao by the Taoists, Sunya by the Buddhists, and the Whole by Parmenides

Notice how the Matrix, Brahma, Tao, and the Whole are impersonal. This is very different from the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, Allah, and even the Polythesist Tara, Quan Yin, Kali, Ganesh, etc who all possess human-like qualities as to be angry, benevolent, merciful, etc. 

So where does our idea of a personal God, Yahweh, Tara, or Ganesh come from?


## An Effect of the Positive Force

The human mind naturally creates the idea of God to have an extremely positive counterweight to extremely negative perceptions* such as pain, suffering, typhoons, earthquakes,  death, poverty, evil, etc. 

> *We say "Oh my God!" more during bad and suprising experiences than in regular and ordinary ones. We rarely say "Oh my God, I'm eating breakfast" or "Oh my God, I'm breathing and reading a blog post"


The proof is that all human societies see God as a positive entity Who loves the good and punishes the bad, and never the other way around. 
- Polytheism is having many god-ideas to counterbalance many isolated negative perceptions
- Monotheism is having a single God-idea for all negative perceptions
- Atheism is in treating all perceptions as they are -- as Existence, neither positive nor negative
- Agnosticism is in not bothering to think about the specifics at all

In our internet analogy:
- Positivity is information, Negativity is lack of information
- Atheism is the 'internet'
- Monotheism is 'AWS, Google Cloud, Azure'
- Polytheism is 'local webservers and VPN'
- Agnosticism is using the internet without caring how it works

In our novel analogy, where the novel stands for Existence:
- Positivity is a story, Negativity is not having a story
- Atheism is a novel having an unknown author
- Polytheism is having many authors
- Monotheism is having one author
- Agnosticism is enjoying the novel without caring who the author is


## Omnitheism to Unify All the Feelings

Here we introduce the concept of **omnitheism** which is the knowledge of how different types of people view the Creator of Existence. Its goal is to bring harmony to the different religions, each of which pushes their own idea of the Creator to the detriment of others. They ignore the fact that different societies have different negative experiences which lead to them requiring a different of God-idea.

For example:
- The Jews were surrounded by strong enemies such as the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians. And so they felt* the need to create a Yahweh that was strong
- The Romans were imperial so they felt the need to invent their God to be superior to all other gods
- The Arabs were tribal and unruly, often causing raids and disorders. And so the Prophet Mohammad felt the need to craft Allah to make them submit to a single God
- The Hindus were multicultural and so they felt the need to invent different gods for their different cultures
- The Buddha saw the problems with Hinduism and so he created Buddhism as to have no personal God, and instead rely on the impersonal Sunya or Zen
 
<!-- Thus, for monotheism and polytheism, the idea of God is the positive counterweight to negative things in Existence, while for Atheism and Omnitheism, God is that Existence itself. 

The definition of the former focuses on the negative aspect of Existence, such as Apocalypse, the Devil, and the End of Days, while the latter does not. Since mentality creates reality, we go with the latter definition. In this way, we build a system that is naturally free from conflict and negativity, very different from the other systems that have naturally-perpetual conflict .

> *We emphasize 'felt the need' in order to be consistent with [our moral solution](/superphysics/principles/idea) of getting all the feelings of diifferent human societies so that we can find the lowest-common-denominator-feeling. 


If all the inventions of God, Yahweh, Allah, etc are all caused by our positive feelings in their effort to counteract negative feelings, then finding a common positive feeling can lead to a framework to unify all those Supreme Deities for the sake of peace and unity instead of division and conflict. 

Omnitheism proposes to do this by having only two things:

1. Existence - this is the impersonal Whole
2. A Supreme Entity - this is the personal Deity

Existence has infinite (or arbitrary) attributes, whereas the Supreme Entity only has two attributes:

1. It is Supreme
2. It is an Entity

Thus, the impersonal Matrix, Sunya, Brahma, Tao represents Existence, while the personal God, Allah, Yahweh, Kali, Ganesh, represent the personal solutions to the negativity in Existence. 

The more negativity the mind experiences, the more deities it needs to create as a counterweight. But since negativity arises from ignorance, then the more knowledge humans get, the less the need for having so many deities with so many attributes. 

For example, in the ancient past, humans didn't know the principles behind volcanic eruptions and so they assigned it to a volcano-god. After geology was known, then the volcano-god no longer needs to exist. 

We can extend this pattern and say that as humans learn and master the principles of Existence, then the less their need for numerous deities or for a Supreme Deity to have so many attributes. Instead, those attributes transfer over onto those existential principles. This is why our Supreme Entity concept only has two attributes, and Existence has infinite ones.


{{< img src="/graphics/ignorance.png" alt="Ignorance" cap="The more humans learn about the principles in Existence, the more they assume the attributes of the Supreme. For example, a caveman would think that only witchcraft could let humans communicate with those on the other side of the world -- something that we can now do on a daily basis through the knoweldge of electromagnetic principles" >}}


This then converts reality from something that we currently suffer in, with poverty, inequality, natural disasters, terrorism, etc. into something that we enjoy and is worth existing in. This is similar to how we go to a theater to experience enjoyment, and not to feel more disturbed or depressed.


## God Created Existence for Happiness, Not Suffering

The key thing that separates a reality of suffering and a reality of joy, is then knowing how feelings lead to mentality and how mentality creates reality. To understand this latter part, we need to define consciousness. This would help us break out of the limitations created by science which is based primarily on the five senses, ignoring the sixth sense of feelings and intuition.
