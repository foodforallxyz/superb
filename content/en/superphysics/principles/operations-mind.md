Idea and feelings seem separate because the physical brain and heart, as the 'sensors' of ideas and feelings are located in different areas of the body. 

Our Metaphysics of Things state that ideas and feelings are merely two forms of the same thing. 
- A feeling is information in a wave-form, with the wave being powered by energy or desire of the Supreme Entity or Mind 
- An idea is encapsulated information, as a wave-form that is cut-off from other wave-forms.

The mechanism of separation is called Maya or the Illusion, which is a product of the Negative Force. It follows that the opposite mechanism for unity is called Truth as the Positive Force.   

The main operation of the mind is to connect ideas as to go back to the original total unity of ideas before existence began*. This connection gradually dispels the Maya and is known as knowledge which comes from learning and thinking. 


> *We call this state as pre-existence


Thinking is the operation of the mind to grab perceptions and connect them with each other. This is similar to how we assemble jigsaw puzzles. 

Learning is the operation of the mind that realizes the patterns from the unity of perceptions. When we connect ideas, we realize that some ideas are easier to connect with each other, producing less stress on the mind. On the other hand, some ideas are impossible to connect (are absurd like faeries) or have a connection that is stressful to maintain (such as sophistrical ideas like flat earth theory).

Feeling is the ability to sense non-thought information which is all of the universe. This is why Taoism and Hinduism belittle intellectuality, which is the opposite of Western science which enshrines intellectuality and denounces feelings.  

<!--  This is similar to us finding a technique to connect jigsaw puzzles for efficiently.

Thus, the operations of the mind or the soul can be divided into thinking and feeling. 

### Thinking

Thinking is the effect-part of existence. This works on thought-objects. 

Our main sources to list down the dynamics of thinking is from Socrates (instead of Aristotle), David Hume, and Ibn Khaldun. We also use Buddhism. 


### Feeling 

Feeling is the causal part of existence. This operation comes first before thinking and has accordingly been discussed by the ancients much more than the thinking part.  

Our main sources to list down the dynamics of feelings are Hinduism*, Taoism, Spinoza, and the Pythagoreans. 


> *Buddhism is thinking, Hinduism is for feeling. Buddhism checks the tendency of Hinduism to fall into blind-belief or dogma, just as reason prevents us from falling in blindly in love
