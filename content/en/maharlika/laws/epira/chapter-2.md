SEC. 5. Organization. – The electric power industry shall be divided into four (4) sectors, namely:
generation, transmission, distribution and supply.SEC. 6. Generation Sector. – Generation of electric power, a business affected with public
interest, shall be competitive and open.
Upon the effectivity of this Act, any new generation company shall, before it operates, secure from
the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) a certificate of compliance pursuant to the standards set forth in
this Act, as well as health, safety and environmental clearances from the appropriate government agencies
under existing laws.

Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, power generation shall not be considered a public utility
operation. For this purpose, any person or entity engaged or which shall engage in power generation and
supply of electricity shall not be required to secure a national franchise.
Upon implementation of retail competition and open access, the prices charged by a generation
company for the supply of electricity shall not be subject to regulation by the ERC except as otherwise
provided in this Act.

Pursuant to the objective of lowering electricity rates to end-users, sales of generated power by
generation companies shall be value added tax zero-rated.
The ERC shall, in determining the existence of market power abuse or anti-competitive behavior,
require from generation companies the submission of their financial statements.

SEC. 7 Transmission Sector.- The transmission of electric power shall be regulated common
electricity carries business, subject to the ratemaking powers of the ERC.
The ERC shall set the standards of the voltage transmission that shall distinguish the transmission
from the subtransmission assets. Pending the issuance of such new standards, the distinction between the
transmission and subtransmission assets shall be as follows: 230 kilovolts and above in the Luzon grid, 69
kilovolts and above in the Visayas and in the isolated distribution systems, and 138 kilovolts and above in
the Mindanao Grid: Provided, That for the Visayas and the isolated distribution system, should the 69
kilovolt line not form part of the main transmission grid and be directly connected to the substation of the
distribution utility, it shall form part of the subtransmission system.

SEC. 8. Creation of the National Transmission Company.- There is hereby created a National
Transmission Corporation, hereinafter referred to as TRANSCO, which shall assume the electrical
transmission function of the National Power Corporation (NPC), and have the powers and functions
hereinafter granted. The TRANSCO shall assume the authority and responsibility of NPC for the planning,
construction and centralized operation and maintenance of its high voltage transmission facilities, including
grid interconnections and ancillary services.
Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, the transmission and subtransmission
facilities of NPC and all other assets related to transmission operations, including the nationwide franchise
of NPC for the operation of the transmission system and the grid, shall be transferred to the TRANSCO.
The TRANSCO shall be wholly owned by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management
Corporation (PSALM Corp.).

The subtransmission functions and assets shall be segregated from the transmission functions,
assets and liabilities for transparency and disposal: Provided, That the subtransmission assets shall be
operated and maintained by TRANSCO until their disposal to qualified distribution utilities which are in a
position to take over the responsibility for operating, maintaining, upgrading, and expanding said assets.
All transmission and subtransmission related liabilities of NPC shall be transferred to and assumed by the
PSALM Corp.

TRANSCO shall negotiate with and thereafter transfer such functions, assets, and associated
liabilities to the qualified distribution utility or utilities connected to such subtransmission facilities notlater than two (2) years from the effectivity of this Act or the start of open access, whichever comes earlier:
Provided, That in the case of electric cooperatives, the TRANSCO shall grant concessional financing over
a period of twenty (20) years: Provided, however, That the installment payments to TRANSCO for the
acquisition of subtransmission facilities shall be given first priority by the electric cooperatives out of the
net income derived from such facilities. The TRANSCO shall determine the disposal value of the
subtransmission assets based on the revenue potential of such assets.
In case of disagreement in valuation, procedures, ownership participation and other issues, the
ERC shall resolve such issues.

The take over by a distribution utility of any subtransmission asset shall not cause a diminution of
service and quality to the end-users. Where there are two or more connected distribution utilities, the
consortium or juridical entity shall be formed by and composed of all of them and thereafter shall be
granted a franchise to operate the subtransmission asset by the ERC.
The subscription rights of each distribution utility involved shall be proportionate
to their load requirements unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
Aside from the PSALM Corp., TRANSCO and connected distribution utilities, no third party shall
be allowed ownership or management participation, in whole or in part, in such subtransmission entity.
The TRANSCO may exercise the power of eminent domain subject to the requirements of the
Constitution and existing laws. Except as provided herein, no person, company or entity other than the
TRANSCO shall own any transmission facilities.

Prior to the transfer of the transmission functions by NPC to TRANSCO, and before the
promulgation of the Grid Code, ERC shall ensure that NPC shall provide to all electric power industry
participants open and non-discriminatory access to its transmission system. Any violation thereof shall be
subject to the fines and penalties imposed herein.

Upon the initial implementation of open access, the ERC shall allow all electricity end-users with
a monthly average peak demand of at least one megawatt (1MW) for the preceding twelve (12) months to
be the contestable market. Two (2) years thereafter, the threshold level for the contestable market shall be
reduced to seven hundred fifty kilowatts (750kW). At this level, aggregators shall be allowed to supply
electricity to end-users whose aggregate demand within a contiguous area is at least seven hundred fifty
kilowatts (750kW). Subsequently and every year thereafter, the ERC shall evaluate the performance of the
market. On the basis of such evaluation, it shall gradually reduce threshold level until it reaches the
household demand level. In the case of electric cooperatives, retail competition and open access shall be
implemented not earlier than five (5) years upon the effectivity of this Act.
SEC. 32. NPC Stranded Debt and Contract Cost Recovery. – Stranded debt of NPC shall refer to
any unpaid financial obligations of NPC.
Stranded contract costs of NPC shall refer to the excess of the contracted cost of electricity under

amount not to exceed Two hundred billion pesos (P200,000,000,000,00)
The ERC shall verify the reasonable amounts and determine the manner and duration for the full
recovery of stranded debt and stranded contract costs as defined herein: Provided, That the duration for
such recovery shall not be shorter than fifteen (15) years nor longer than twenty-five (25) years. The ERC
shall, at the end of the first year of the implementation of stranded cost recovery and every year thereafter,
conducts a review to determine whether there is under-recovery or over-recovery and adjust (tune-up) the
level of stranded cost recovery charge accordingly. Any amount to be included for stranded cost recovery
shall be reflected as a separate item in the consumer billing statement.SEC. 33. Distribution Utilities Stranded Contract Costs Recovery. – Stranded contract costs of
distribution utilities shall refer to the excess of the contracted cost of electricity under eligible contracts of
such utilities over the actual selling price of such contracts in the market. Such contracts shall have been
approved by the ERB as of December 31, 2000.
A distribution utility shall recover stranded contract costs: Provided, however, That such costs of
the IPPs of distribution utilities are subject to review by ERC in order to determine fairness and
reasonableness in relation to the average price of land-based IPP projects entered into by NPC at the time
they were contracted. The ERC shall take into consideration all factors that affect the total cost of NPC IPP
generation projects, including direct or indirect subsidies or incentives provided by the Government.
Within one (1) year from the start of open access, any distribution utility that seeks recovery of
stranded contract costs shall file with the ERC notice of such intent together with an estimate of such
obligations, including the present value thereof and such other supporting data as may be required by the
ERC. Any distribution utility that does not file within the date specified shall not be eligible for such
recovery.
Any distribution utility which seeks to recover stranded cost shall have a duty to mitigate its
potential stranded contract costs by making reasonable best efforts to:
(a) reduce the costs of its existing contracts with IPPs to a level not exceeding the average buying
price of other land-based electric power generators; and
(b) submit to an annual earnings review by the ERC and use its earnings above its authorized rate
of return to reduce the book value of contracts until the end of the stranded cost recovery
period.
Other mitigating measures which are reasonably known and generally accepted within the electric
power industry shall be utilized. The ERC shall not require the distribution utility to take a loss to reduce
stranded contract costs or divest assets, unless the divestiture is imposed as a penalty as provided herein.
The relevant distribution utility shall submit to the ERC quarterly reports showing the amount of
stranded costs recovered and the balance remaining to be recovered.
Within three (3) months from the submission of the application for stranded cost recovery by the
relevant distribution utilities, the ERC shall verify the reasonable amounts and determine the manner and
duration for the full recovery of stranded contract costs as defined herein: Provided, That the duration for
such recovery shall not be shorter than fifteen (15) years nor longer than twenty-five (25) years. Any
amount to be included for stranded cost recovery shall be reflected as a separate item in the consumer
billing statement.
The ERC shall, at the end of the first year of the implementation of stranded cost recovery and
every year thereafter, conduct a review to determine whether there is under-recovery or over recovery and
adjust (true-up) the level of stranded cost recovery charge accordingly. In case of an over-recovery, the
ERC shall ensure that any excess amount shall be remitted to the Special Trust Fund created under Section
34 hereof. A separate account shall be created for these amounts which shall be held in trust for any future
claims of distribution utilities for stranded cost recovery. At the end of the stranded cost recovery period,
any remaining amount in this account shall be used to reduce the electricity rates to the end-users.
SEC. 34. Universal Charge. – Within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act, a universal
charge to be determined, fixed and approved by the ERC., shall be imposed on all electricity end-users for
the following purposes:(a) Payment for the stranded debts in excess of the amount assumed by the National Government
and stranded contract costs of NPC and as well as qualified stranded contract costs of
distribution utilities resulting from the restructuring of the industry;
(b) Missionary electrification;
(c) The equalization of the taxes and royalties applied to indigenous or renewable sources of
energy vis-a-vis imported energy fuels;
(d) An environmental charge equivalent to one-fourth of one centavo per kilowatt-hour
(P0.0025/kWh), which shall accrue to an environmental fund to be used solely for watershed
