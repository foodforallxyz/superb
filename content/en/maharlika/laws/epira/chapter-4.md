Act”. For this purpose, the schedule of compensation of the ERC personnel, except for the initial salaries
and compensation of the Chairman and members of the Commission, shall be submitted for approval by the
President of the Philippines. The new schedule of compensation shall be implemented within six (6)
months from the effectivity of this Act and may be upgraded by the President of the Philippines as the need
arises: Provided, That in no case shall the rate be upgraded more than once a year.
The Chairman and members of the Commission shall initially be entitled to the same salaries,
allowances and benefits as those of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court,

the privileges provided for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, respectively.

SEC. 40. Enhancement of Technical Competence. – The ERC shall establish rigorous training
programs for its staff for the purpose of enhancing the technical competence of the ERC in the following
areas: evaluation of technical performance and monitoring of compliance with service and performance
standards, performance-based rate-setting reform, environmental standards and such other areas as will
enable the ERC to adequately perform its duties and functions.
SEC. 41. Promotion of Consumer Interests. – The ERC shall handle consumer complaints and
ensure the adequate promotion of consumer interests.
SEC. 42. Budget of the ERC. – The amount of One hundred fifty million pesos (P150,000,000.00)
is hereby allocated from the existing budget of the ERB for the initial operation of the ERC. Any balance
shall initially be sourced from the Office of the President of the Philippines. Thereafter, the annual budget
of the ERC shall be included in the regular or special appropriations.
SEC. 43. Functions of the ERC. –The ERC shall promote competition, encourage market
development, ensure customer choice and penalize abuse of market power in the restructured electricity
industry. In appropriate cases, the ERC is authorized to issue cease and desist order after due notice and
hearing. Towards this end, it shall be responsible for the following key functions in the restuctured
industry:
(a) Enforce the implementing rules and regulations of this Act;
(b) Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, promulgate and enforce, in
accordance with law, a National Grid Code and a Distribution Code which shall include,
but not limited to, the following:
(i) Performance standards for TRANSCO O & M Concessionaire, distribution utilities
and suppliers: Provided, That in the establishment of the performance standards, the
nature and function of the entities shall be considered; and
(ii) Financial capability standards for the generating companies, the TRANSCO,
distribution utilities and suppliers: Provided, further, That such standards are set to
ensure that the electric power industry participants meet the minimum financial
standards to protect the public interest. Determine, fix, and approve, after due notice
and public hearings the universal charge, to be imposed on all electricity end-users
pursuant to Section 34 hereof.
(c) Enforce the rules and regulations governing the operations of the electricity spot market and
the activities of the spot market operator and other participants in the spot market, for the
purpose of ensuring a greater supply and rational pricing of electricity;
(d) Determine the level of cross subsidies in the existing retail rate until the same is removed
pursuant to Section 74 hereof;
(e) Amend or revoke, after due notice and hearing, the authority to operate of any person or entity
which fails to comply with the provisions hereof, the IRR or any order or resolution of the
ERC. In the event a divestment is required, the ERC shall allow the affected party sufficient
time to remedy the infraction or for an orderly disposal, but in no case exceed twelve (12)
months from the issuance of the order;
(f) In the public interest, establish and enforce a methodology for setting transmission and
distribution wheeling rates and retail rates for the captive market of a distribution utility,
taking intro account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency or inefficiency of theregulated entities. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable costs
and a reasonable return on rate base (RORB) to enable the entity to operate viably. The ERC
may adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may
deem appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied must ensure a
reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed shall be non-discriminatory. To achieve
this objective and to ensure the complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the
recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is
hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC based
on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations
it may promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form or rate-setting methodology, which
shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting methodology used is RORB, it shall be
subject to the following guidelines:
(i) For purposes of determining the rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility
may be allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every three (3) years
by an independent appraisal company: Provided, however, That ERC may give an
exemption in case of unusual devaluation: Provided, further, That the ERC shall
exert efforts to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;
(ii) Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible return on rate base;
(iii) In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to the end-users, the
ERC shall establish minimum efficiency performance standards for the TRANSCO
and distribution utilities including systems losses, interruption frequency rates, and
collection efficiency;
(iv) Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall not
be allowed to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays not
excused by force majeure, penalties and related interest during construction
applicable to these unexcused delays; and
(v) Any significant operating costs or project investments of the TRANSCO and
distribution utilities which shall become part of the rate base shall be subject to
verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting and procurement of the
equipment, assets and services have been subjected to transparent and accepted
industry procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public interest.
(g) Three (3) years after the imposition of the universal charge, ensure that the charges of the
TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall bear no cross subsidies between grids, within
grids, or between classes of customers, except as provided herein;
(h) Review and approve any changes on the terms and conditions of service of the TRANSCO or
any distribution utility;
(i) Allow the TRANSCO to charge user fees for ancillary services to all electric power industry
participants or self-generating entities connected to the grid. Such fees shall be fixed by the
ERC after due notice and public hearing;
(j) Set a lifeline rate for the marginalized end-users;
(k) Monitor and take measures in accordance with this Act to penalize abuse of market power,
cartelization, and anti-competitive or discriminatory behavior by any electric power industry
participant;
(l) Impose fines or penalties for any non-compliance with or breach of this Act, the IRR of this
Act and the rules and regulations which it promulgates or administers;(m) Take any other action delegated to it pursuant to this Act;
(n) Before the end of April of each year, submit to the Office of the President of the Philippines
and Congress, copy furnished the DOE, an annual report containing such matters or cases
which have been filed before or referred to it during the preceding year, the actions and
proceedings undertaken and its decision or resolution in each case. The ERC shall make
copies of such reports available to any interested party upon payment of a charge which
reflects the printing costs. The ERC shall publish all its decisions involving rates and anti-
competitive cases in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation, and/or post
electronically and circulate to all interested electric power industry participants copies of its
resolutions to ensure fair and impartial treatment;
(o) Monitor the activities in the generation and supply of the electric power industry with the end
in view of promoting free market competition and ensuring that the allocation or pass through
of bulk purchase cost by distributors is transparent, non-discriminatory and that any existing
subsidies shall be divided pro-rata among all retail suppliers;
(p) Act on applications for or modifications of certificates of public convenience and/or necessity,
licenses or permits of franchised electric utilities in accordance with law and revoke, review
and modify such certificates, licenses or permits in appropriate cases, such as in cases of
violations of the Grid Code, Distribution Code and other rules and regulations issued by the
ERC in accordance with law;
(q) Act on applications for cost recovery and return on demand side management projects;
(r) In the exercise of its investigative and quasi-judicial powers, act against any participant or
player in the energy sector for violations of any law, rule and regulation governing the same,
including the rules on cross-ownership, anti-competitive practices, abuse of market positions
and similar or related acts by any participant in the energy sector or by any person, as may be
provided by law, and require any person or entity to submit any report or data relative to any
investigation or hearing conducted pursuant to this Act;

(t) Perform such other regulatory functions as are appropriate and necessary in order to ensure
the successful restructuring and modernization of the electric power industry, such as, but not
limited to, the rules and guidelines under which generation companies, distribution utilities
which are not publicly listed shall offer and sell to the public a portion not less than fifteen
percent (15%) of their common shares of stocks: Provided, however, That generation
companies, distribution utilities or their respective holding companies that are already listed in
the PSE are deemed in compliance. For existing companies, such public offering shall be
implemented not later than five (5) years from the effectivity of this Act. New companies
shall implement their respective public offerings not later than five (5) years from the
issuance of their certificate of compliance; and
(u) The ERC shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases contesting rates,
fees, fines and penalties imposed by the ERC in the exercise of the above mentioned powers,
functions and responsibilities and over all cases involving disputes between and among
participants or players in the energy sector.
All notices of hearings to be conducted by the ERC for the purpose of fixing rates or fees shall be published
at least twice for two successive weeks in two (2) newspapers of nationwide circulation.SEC. 44. Transfer of Powers and Functions. – The powers and functions of the Energy Regulatory
Board not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act are hereby transferred to the ERC. The foregoing
transfer of powers and functions shall include all applicable funds and appropriations, records, equipment,
property and personnel as may be necessary.

SEC. 45. Cross Ownership, Market Power Abuse and Anti-Competitive Behavior. – No participant
in the electricity industry or any other person may engage in any anti-competitive behavior including, but
not limited to, cross-subsidization, price or market manipulation, or other unfair trade practices detrimental
to the encouragement and protection of contestable markets.
No generation company, distribution utility, or its respective subsidiary or affiliate or stockholder
or official of a generation company or distribution utility, or other entity engaged in generating and
supplying electricity specified by ERC within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, shall be
allowed to hold any interest, directly or indirectly, in TRANSCO or its concessionaire. Likewise, the
TRANSCO, or its concessionaire or any of its stockholders or officials or any of their relatives within the
fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, shall not hold any interest, whether directly or indirectly, in
any generation company or distribution utility. Except for ex officio government-appointed representatives,
no person who is an officer or director of the TRANSCO or its concessionaire shall be an officer or director
of any generation company, distribution utility or supplier.
An “affiliate” means any person which, alone or together with any other person, directly or
indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
another person. As used herein, “control” shall mean the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management policies of a person by contract, agency or otherwise.
To promote true market competition and prevent harmful monopoly and market power abuse, the
ERC shall enforce the following safeguards:
(a) No company or related group can own, operate or control more than thirty percent (30%) of
the installed generating capacity of a grid and/or twenty-five percent (25%) of the national
installed generating capacity. “Related group” includes a person’s business interests,
including its subsidiaries, affiliates, directors or officers or any of their relatives by
consanguinity or affinity, legitimate or common law, within the fourth civil degree;
(b) Distribution utilities may enter into bilateral power supply contracts subject to review by the
ERC: Provided, That such review shall only be required for distribution utilities whose
markets have not reached household demand level. For the purpose of preventing market
power abuse between associated firms engaged in generation and distribution, no distribution
utility shall be allowed to source from bilateral power supply contracts more than fifty percent
(50%) of its total demand from an associated firm engaged in generation but such limitation,
however, shall not prejudice contracts entered into prior to the effectivity of this Act. An
associated firm with respect to another entity refers to any person which, alone or together
with any other person, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such entity; and
(c) For the first five (5) years from the establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market, no
distribution utility shall source more than ninety percent (90%) of its total demand from
bilateral power supply contracts.
For purposes of this Section, the grid basis shall consist of three (3) separate grids, namely Luzon,
Visayas and Mindanao. The ERC shall have the authority to modify or amend this definition of a grid when
two or more of the three separate grids become sufficiently interconnected to constitute a single grid or as
conditions may otherwise permit.Exceptions from these limitations shall be allowed for isolated grids that are not connected to the
high voltage transmission system. Except as otherwise provided for in this Section, any restriction on
ownership and/or control between or within sectors of the electricity industry may be imposed by ERC only
insofar as the enforcement of the provisions of this Section is concerned.
The ERC shall, within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act., promulgate rules and
regulations to ensure and promote competition, encourage market development and customer choice and
discourage/penalize abuse of market power, cartelization and any anti-competitive or discriminatory
behavior, in order to further the intent of this Act and protect the public interest. Such rules and regulations
shall define the following:
(a) the relevant markets for purposes of establishing abuse or misuse of monopoly or market
position;
(b) areas of isolated grids; and
(c) the periodic reportorial requirements of electric power industry participants as may be
necessary to enforce the provisions of this Section.
The ERC shall, motu proprio, monitor and penalize any market power abuse or anti-competitive
or discriminatory act or behavior by any participant in the electric power industry. Upon finding that a
market participant has engaged in such act or behavior, the ERC shall stop and redress the same. Such
remedies shall, without limitation, include the imposition of price controls, issuance of injunctions,
requirement of divestment or disgorgement of excess profits and imposition of fines and penalties pursuant
to this Act.
The ERC shall, within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act, promulgate rules and
regulations providing for a complaint procedure that, without limitation, provides the accused party with
notice and an opportunity to be heard.

suffer the penalty of prision mayor and fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Ten million
pesos (P10,000,000.00), or both, at the discretion of the court.
The members of the Board of Directors of the juridical companies participating in or covered in
the generation companies, the distribution utilities, the TRANSCO or its concessionaire or supplier who
violate the provisions of this Act may be fined by an amount not exceeding double the amount of damages
caused by the offender or by imprisonment of one (1) year or two (2) years or both at the discretion of the
court. This rule shall apply to the members of the Board who knowingly or by neglect allows the
commission or omission under the law.
If the offender is a government official or employee, he shall, in addition, be dismissed from the
government service with prejudice to reinstatement and with perpetual or temporary disqualification from
holding any elective or appointive office.
If the offender is an alien, he may, in addition to the penalties prescribed, be deported without
further proceedings after service of sentence.
Any case which involves question of fact shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals and those
which involve question of law shall be directly appealable to the Supreme Court.The administrative sanction that may be imposed by the ERC shall be without prejudice to the
filing of a criminal action, if warranted.
To ensure compliance with this Act, the penalty of prision correccional or a fine ranging from
Five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) to Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00), or both, at the discretion of the
court, shall be imposed on any person, including but not limited to the president, member of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating Officer of the corporation, partnership, or any other entity

Any party to an administrative proceeding may, at any time, make an offer to the ERC,
conditionally or otherwise, for a consented decree, voluntary compliance or desistance and other settlement
of the case. The offer and any or all of the ultimate facts upon which the offer is based shall be considered
for settlement purposes only and shall not be used as evidence against any party for any other purpose and
shall not constitute an admission by the party making the offer of any violation of the laws, rules,
regulations, orders and resolutions of the ERC, nor as a waiver to file any warranted criminal actions.
In addition, Congress may, upon recommendation of the DOE and/or ERC, revoke such franchise
or privilege granted to the party who violated the provisions of this Act.
