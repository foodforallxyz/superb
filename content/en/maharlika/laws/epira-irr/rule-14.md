## Section 1.

Guiding Principle.

Pursuant to Section 59 of the Act, the provision of electric service in remote
and Unviable Areas that the Distribution Utility is unable to service for any
reason shall be opened to other qualified third parties. The provision of
electricity in Unviable Areas by qualified third parties shall be a regulated
business.
Section 2. Scope of Application.
This Rule shall apply to third parties qualified and authorized by ERC in
accordance with the Act to undertake the provision of electric service in
remote and Unviable Areas that a Distribution Utility is unable to serve.
Section 3. Determination of Remote and Unviable Areas.
Every September, the DOE shall issue a declaration of all the remote and
Unviable Areas that cannot be served by a Distribution Utility within the
following three (3) years. The declaration shall be consistent with the PDP
and made in consultation with the NEA and Distribution Utilities. The
remote and Unviable Areas specified in the declaration shall be open for
participation by qualified third parties.
Section 4. Determination of Qualified Third Parties.
The DOE shall set criteria for determining qualified third parties that may
participate in providing electricity to remote and Unviable Areas. These
criteria may include financial, technical, environmental, and other indices of
performance.
The criteria shall give preference to parties that would utilize least-cost new
Renewable Energy Resources in providing electricity.
Section 5.
Rights and Obligations of Qualified Third Parties.
(a) Any Distribution Utility that fails to provide electricity to an Unviable
Area shall be required by the ERC to enter into a contract with a
qualified third party to provide electric service in such an Unviable
Area.
(b) A qualified third party shall comply with all applicable provisions of
the Distribution Code, including the requirement to obtain a COC for
its Generation Facilities and other permits the ERC may require.
(c) A qualified third party shall charge rates in Unviable Areas according
to ERC rules for cost recovery of Generation Facilities and associated
power delivery systems.
(d) A qualified third party shall submit annual financial statements to
ERC for determining the effectiveness of the approved rate.
Page 49 of 100(e)
A qualified third party shall report annually to DOE the rate of
electrification of its coverage areas.
Section 6.
Obligations of the ERC.
(a) The ERC shall set guidelines for the issuance of permits to qualified
third parties that serve a remote or unserved and Unviable Area
within the Distribution Utility’s Franchise Area.
(b) The ERC shall set the rules in computing rates that allow full cost
recovery of the Generation Facilities and delivery systems built to
serve remote or unserved and Unviable Areas.
PART III - ELECTRICITY RATE AND CHARGES
RULE 15.
Section 1.
UNBUNDLING OF RATES
Guiding Principle.
Consistent with Section 36 of the Act and Rule 10 on Structural and
Functional Unbundling of Electric Power Industry Participants, this Rule on
the Unbundling of Rates shall result in the identification and separation of
the individual charge for providing a specific electric service to any End-user
for generation, transmission, distribution, and supply. [Consistent with Sec.
36]
Section 2.
Scope of Application.
This Rule shall apply to all Electric Power Industry Participants that are
currently engaged or will be engaged in any of the business activities as
stated in Section 5 of the Act.
Section 3.
Parameters for Unbundling Rates and Costs of Service.
(a) An Electric Power Industry Participant shall identify, separate and
unbundle its rates, charges, and costs in accordance with Rule 10 on
Structural and Functional Unbundling of Electric Power Industry
Participants.
(b) In the determination of eligible costs of service to be charged to the
End-users, the ERC shall establish the minimum efficiency standards
covering the technical, financial, and customer service performance
criteria including systems losses, and interruption frequency rates
parameters among others.
(c) The rate base of the TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire or any
Distribution Utility shall exclude management inefficiencies, such as
but not limited to cost of project delays not due to any force majeure,
and penalties and related interest during construction and other
disallowances to be determined by ERC.
(d) Interest expenses shall not be allowed as deductions from permissible
Return on Rate Base (RORB).
Page 50 of 100(e)
TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and Distribution Utilities
may directly or indirectly engage in any related business which
maximizes the utilization of their assets.
Section 4.
Method of Rate Unbundling.
The ERC shall prescribe the methodology for rate unbundling.
Section 5.
(a)
Ratemaking Design and Methodology.
The ERC shall, in the public interest, establish and enforce a
methodology for setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates
and Retail Rates for the Captive Market of a Distribution Utility,
taking into account all relevant considerations, including the
efficiency or inefficiency of the regulated entities, as well as the
expansion or improvement of the Transmission facilities pursuant to a
plan approved by the ERC under Section 10 of Rule 6 on
Transmission Sector, and the Distribution Utilities under Rule 7 on
Distribution Sector. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery
of just and reasonable costs and a reasonable RORB to enable the
entity to operate viably. The ERC may adopt alternative forms of
internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may deem
appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied
must ensure a reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed
shall be non-discriminatory and shall take into consideration, among
others, the franchise tax. To achieve this objective and to ensure the
complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the recoverable rate of
system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is
hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be
determined by the ERC based on load density, sales mix, cost of
service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may
promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form of rate-setting
methodology, which shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting
methodology used is RORB, it shall be subject to the following
guidelines:
(i) For purposes of determining the rate base, the TRANSCO or its
Buyer or Concessionaire or any Distribution Utility may be
allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every
three (3) years by an independent appraisal company: Provided,
however, That ERC may give an exemption in case of unusual
devaluation: Provided, further, That the ERC shall exert efforts
to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;
(ii) Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible
RORB;
(iii) In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to
the End-users, the ERC shall establish minimum efficiency
performance standards for the TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire and Distribution Utilities including systems
losses, interruption frequency rates, and collection efficiency;
Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or its Buyer or
Concessionaire or any Distribution Utility shall not be allowed
(iv)
Page 51 of 100to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays
not excused by force majeure, penalties and related interest
during construction applicable to these unexcused delays;
(b)
(v) Any significant operating costs or project investments of the
TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire and Distribution
Utilities which shall become part of the rate base shall be
subject to verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting
and procurement of the equipment, assets and services have
been subjected to transparent and accepted industry
procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public
interest; and
(vi) The interest incurred during construction may be capitalized
and included in the rate base upon commissioning of the asset.
The Retail Rates charged by Distribution Utilities for the Supply of
Electricity in their Captive Market shall be subject to regulation by the
ERC based on the principle of full recovery of prudent and reasonable
economic costs incurred, or such other principles that will promote
efficiency as may be determined by the ERC.
Every Distribution Utility or Supplier to the Contestable Market,
whichever is applicable, shall identify and segregate in its bills to End-
users the components of the Retail Rate as follows: generation,
transmission, distribution, supply and other related charges for
electric service.
(c) In the case of isolated, remote and Unviable Areas serviced by a
qualified third party as defined in Rule 14 on Provision of Electricity
by Qualified Third Parties, the ERC shall set the rules for rates
computation and determination.
(d) The ERC shall recognize the different cost structures in serving
isolated areas.
Section 6.
Unbundled Rate Filing Requirements.
(a) As required by the Act, NPC and Distribution Utilities shall file within
six (6) months from the effectivity of the Act for revised rates with
costs and other relevant accounts unbundled by business activity.
(b) The ERC shall within six (6) months from the date of submission of
revised rates by the Distribution Utility, notify the Distribution Utility
of the action taken on the application.
(c) The rate filing petition shall commence with the unbundling the cost
components of the historical test year costs, from which the new
Retail Rates and unbundled rates or charges are to be developed. The
historical test year, for this purpose, shall be the twelve (12) months
ending 31 December 2000.
Page 52 of 100(d)
Each rate filing petition for unbundled cost of service shall contain
detailed schedules, data, and other relevant information deemed
necessary by the ERC.
RULE 16.
REMOVAL OF CROSS SUBSIDIES
Section 1. Guiding Principle.
Pursuant to Section 74 of the Act, cross subsidies within a Grid, between
Grids, and/or classes of customers shall be phased out in a period not
exceeding three (3) years from the establishment by the ERC of a Universal
Charge which shall be collected from all electricity End-users. Such level of
cross subsidies shall be made transparent and identified separately in the
billing statements provided to End-users by the Suppliers.
Section 2. Scope of Application.
This Rule shall apply to NPC, TRANSCO or its Buyer or Concessionaire,
Distribution Utilities and PSALM.
Section 3. Calculation of Cross Subsidies.
(a) The ERC may extend the period for the removal of cross subsidies for
a maximum period of one (1) year upon finding that cessation of such
mechanism would have a material adverse effect upon the public
interest, particularly the residential End-user; or would have an
immediate, irreparable, and adverse financial effect on Distribution
Utility.
(b) The cross subsidy between Grids in the rates of NPC shall be
calculated on a net basis for each Grid as the difference between:
(c)
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected on the Grid
under the rates in effect during a historical test year that is
adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service on the Grid as
submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling of Rates
and the rate filing requirements that the ERC may issue
pursuant to Rule 15, using the same historical test year.
The cross subsidy within each Grid in the rates of NPC shall be
calculated on a net basis for each customer class within the Grid as
the difference between:
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected from a
customer class under the rates in effect during a historical test
year that is adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service for the same customer
class as submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling
Page 53 of 100of Rates and the rate filing requirements that ERC may issue
pursuant to Rule 15, using the same historical test year.
(d)
The cross subsidy between customer classes within each Distribution
Utility shall be calculated on a net basis for each customer class as
the difference between:
(i) The total revenues that would have been collected from a
customer class under the rates in effect during a historical test
year that is adjusted for differences between actual and forecast
consumption and other factors as ERC may specify; and
(ii) The total unbundled true cost of service for the customer class
as submitted in accordance with Rule 15 on Unbundling of
Rates and the rate filing requirements that ERC may issue
using the same test year.
Section 4. Procedures for Handling Cross Subsidies.
(a) Pending the complete removal of cross subsidies, each subsidy rate
level shall be shown as a separate item in customer billing
statements.
(b) The ERC shall establish a cross subsidy charge to account for all
forms of cross subsidies that remain during the phase out period as
described in Section 5 of this Rule, to be recovered from all electricity
End-users through the Universal Charge pursuant to Rule 18 on the
Universal Charge.
Section 5. Scheme for Phasing Out Cross Subsidies.
(a) The ERC shall issue a scheme for phasing out all cross subsidies,
including subsidies within Grids, between Grids, and between classes
of customers. The phasing out period shall not exceed three (3) years
from the establishment of the Universal Charge pursuant to Rule 18
on Universal Charge. The initial implementation of the phase out
scheme shall occur on the next billing period after issuance of ERC
approval.
(b) The phase out scheme shall be designed to mitigate the effects of the
removal of the cross subsidies. The ERC shall determine which End-
users shall continue to receive subsidies and the level of subsidies
such End-users shall receive during the phase out period.
(c) Together with their filings of unbundled rates reflecting the true costs
of service, pursuant to Rule 15 on Unbundling of Rates, NPC and the
Distribution Utilities shall file with ERC their proposals for the
removal of cross subsidies among the End-users they serve to be
considered by ERC in the formulation of the phase out scheme.
(d) The ERC may extend the period for the removal of cross subsidies for
a maximum period of one (1) year upon finding that cessation of such
mechanism would have a material adverse effect upon the public
interest, particularly the residential End-user; or would have an
Page 54 of 100immediate, irreparable, and adverse financial effect on a Distribution
Utility. Distribution Utilities shall submit to ERC such information as
ERC may specify to help it determine if the cross subsidy removal
mechanism should be extended under this provision.
(e)
If ERC does not extend the period for removal of cross subsidies, the
cross subsidies between regions, within regions, and between
customer classes shall cease to exist at the end of the three (3) year
period from the establishment of the Universal Charge.
Section 6. Exemption from Cross Subsidy Removal for Distribution
Utilities.
The threshold consumption levels and the Lifeline Rates determined by the
ERC shall be exempted from the prohibition on cross subsidies between
classes of customers of a Distribution Utility for a period of ten (10) years,
unless extended by law.
RULE 17.
Section 1.
STRANDED DEBTS AND CONTRACT COSTS RECOVERY
Guiding Principle.
Pursuant to Sections 32 and 33 of the Act, there are three (3) types of
stranded costs recoverable through the Universal Charge:
(a) Stranded Debts;
(b) Stranded Contract Costs of NPC; and
(c) Stranded Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts of Distribution Utilities.
Section 2.
Scope of the Application.
This Rule shall apply to NPC, PSALM and Distribution Utilities with IPP
contracts approved by the ERB as of 31 December 2000.
Section 3.
Procedures and Methodology for Stranded Cost
Determination.
(a) PSALM and any Distribution Utility that has an eligible contract shall
file with ERC their respective petitions for cost recovery under the
Universal Charge and include therewith the methodology in
determining stranded costs. The ERC shall review the methodology
submitted by PSALM and such Distribution Utility to determine, fix,
and approve the level of stranded costs.
(b) At the end of the first year of the implementation of stranded cost
recovery and every year thereafter, the ERC shall conduct a review to
determine whether there is an under- or over recovery and adjust
(true-up) the level of stranded cost recovery charge accordingly. In
determining whether there is an under- or over recovery and in
determining the stranded cost recovery portion of the Universal
Charge for the subsequent period, the ERC shall base the calculation
Page 55 of 100on the following information submitted by the PSALM and the
Distribution Utility which has an eligible contract:
(i) a report of the amounts recovered for stranded costs during the
past year; and
(ii) revised stranded cost amounts based on current market
information.
Section 4.
NPC Stranded Debt and Stranded Contract Cost Recovery.
(a) Consistent with Section 32 of the Act, the National Government shall
directly assume a portion of the financial obligations of NPC
transferred to PSALM in an amount not to exceed Two Hundred
Billion Pesos (P200,000,000,000.00).
(b) The following guidelines shall govern the recovery by the PSALM of the
Stranded Debts and Stranded Contract Costs of NPC:
(i) PSALM shall calculate the amount of the Stranded Debts and
Stranded Contract Costs of NPC that shall form part of the
Universal Charge to be determined, fixed, and approved by the
ERC and reviewed by the same body annually. In determining
the amount of Stranded Contract Costs of NPC, PSALM may
include in such calculation the principal amount and interest
expenses of any such debt raised by PSALM to finance the buy-
out or buy-down of any eligible IPP contract, i.e. contracts
approved by the ERB as of 31 December 2000 as well as any
other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such buy-
out or buy-down: Provided, That the amount recoverable by
PSALM from the Universal Charge fund shall not exceed the
estimated Stranded Contract Costs of such eligible IPP
Contract, assuming that such buy-out or buy-down never
occurred: Provided, further, That PSALM demonstrates to the
ERC’s satisfaction that such buy-out or buy-down will benefit
electricity consumers by reducing that component of the
Universal Charge attributable to such IPP contract.
(ii) The ERC shall verify the reasonable amounts of claims
petitioned by PSALM and determine the manner and duration
by which full recovery of Stranded Debt and Stranded Contract
Costs of NPC is attained: Provided, That the duration for such
recovery shall not be shorter than fifteen (15) years nor longer
than twenty-five (25) years.
(iii) Any amount to be included for stranded cost recovery shall be
reflected as a separate item in the consumer billing statement.
The ERC shall monitor and ensure that there is a separate item
in the consumer billing statement for stranded cost recovery.
Page 56 of 100Section 5. Recovery of Stranded Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts of
Distribution Utilities.
(a) Within one (1) year from the start of Retail Competition and Open
Access, a Distribution Utility that seeks to recover stranded contract
costs arising from its eligible contracts shall file with the ERC a notice
of such intent together with an estimated amount of such obligations.
The Distribution Utility shall provide all pertinent information as may
be required by the ERC. Failure of the Distribution Utility to file
within the date specified shall mean non-eligibility for such recovery.
(b) A Distribution Utility shall recover stranded contract costs: Provided,
however, That such costs of the IPPs of Distribution Utilities are
subject to review by ERC in order to determine fairness and
reasonableness in relation to the average price of land-based IPP
projects entered into by NPC at the time they were contracted. The
ERC shall take into consideration all factors that affect the total cost
of NPC IPP generation projects, including direct or indirect subsidies
or incentives provided by the Government .
(c) Any Distribution Utility which seeks to recover stranded costs shall
have the duty to mitigate its potential stranded costs by exerting
reasonable best efforts to:
(d)
(i) Reduce the costs of its existing eligible contracts with IPPs to a
level not exceeding the average buying price of other land-based
electric power generators; and
(ii) Submit to an annual earnings review by the ERC and use its
earnings above its authorized rate of return to reduce the book
value of contracts until the end of the stranded cost recovery
period.
The Distribution Utility shall submit to the ERC, during its filing for
stranded contract cost recovery, its detailed plan and strategy to
mitigate stranded contract costs.
Other mitigating measures that are reasonably known and generally
accepted within the electric power industry shall be utilized. The ERC
shall not require the Distribution Utility to take a loss to reduce
stranded contract costs or divest assets, unless the divestiture is
imposed as a penalty as provided herein.
(e)
Within three (3) months from the submission of the application for
stranded cost recovery by the relevant Distribution Utilities, the ERC
shall verify the reasonable amounts and determine the manner and
duration for the full recovery of the Stranded Contract Costs of
Eligible Contracts of Distribution Utilities: Provided, That the duration
for such recovery shall not be shorter than fifteen (15) years nor
longer than twenty-five (25) years. For this purpose, “full recovery of
Stranded Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts of Distribution Utilities”
shall mean recovery of Stranded Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts
of Distribution Utilities authorized by the ERC after its pertinent
Page 57 of 100review. Any amount to be included for the recovery of Stranded
Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts of Distribution Utilities shall be
reflected as a separate item in the consumer billing statement.
(f) In the case of an over-recovery, the ERC shall ensure that any excess
amount shall be remitted to the Special Trust Fund (STF) created
pursuant to Section 34 of the Act. A separate account shall be
created for this purpose that shall be held in trust for any future
claims of Distribution Utilities for the recovery of their respective
Stranded Contract Costs of Eligible Contracts of Distribution Utilities.
At the end of the stranded cost recovery period, any remaining
amount or balance in this account shall be used to reduce the
electricity rates to the End-users.
(g) A Distribution Utility, which has an eligible contract, duly authorized
by the ERC, shall submit to ERC quarterly reports showing the
amount of stranded contract costs recovered and the balance
remaining to be recovered from the Universal Charge.
Quarterly shall mean the calendar quarters of January 1 to March 31
(first quarter), April 1 to June 30 (second quarter), July 1 to
September 30 (third quarter), and October 1 to December 31 (fourth
quarter). The relevant Distribution Utility shall submit to the ERC the
quarterly reports within thirty (30) days from the end of each calendar
quarter.
(h)
Upon a finding by the ERC that a Distribution Utility which seeks to
recover stranded contract costs has failed to comply with its
mitigation obligation under Section 33 of the Act, the ERC may not
allow the recovery of stranded contract costs: Provided, That if there is
any fraud or misrepresentation by the Distribution Utility, the ERC
may impose appropriate penalties in accordance with Section 46 of
the Act.
