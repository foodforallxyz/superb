<!-- Superphysics uses the 4 Laws of Value to explain the dynamics of the flow of value in society. This is quantified through the DCTI tool which has 4 aspects:

- Demand (Law 1)
- Capital (Law 2)
- Trade (Law 3)
- Industry (Law 4) -->

Value transfers between people in 5 ways, which we call the 5 modes of exchange which matches the  5 layers of reality:

<!--  of how the value takes shape as it flows as, or between, or among DCTI. -->

Mode | Layer | Mode of Value
--- | --- | ---
1 | Aether | Inspiration (Useful ideas or energy that come from nowhere)
2 | Spacetime | Luck (being at the right place at the right time)
3 | Radiant | Donation, Gift, or Investments that Lose Value
4 | Radioactive | Barter or Investments that Earn Value
5 | Material | Money or Currency


These come in a ratio to make up 100% value for society.

For example, the invention of an car or automobile might require:
- Inspiration (Mode 1) for an idea of inventing a car
- Bumping into an investor (Mode 2) while going out to lunch
- Him giving a grant (Mode 3) for you to make a prototype, and then him investing (Mode 4) money (Mode 5) to build a shop to produce a car  

All these modes lead to the production of a car for society.
