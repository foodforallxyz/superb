The market price is the nominal price that is applied on all customers for some time, from the customer's perspective. 


## The Natural Price

The **natural price** is the lowest common real price from all sellers over time, from the seller's perspective. 

This assumes that:
- the three prior laws were observed 
- there is a sense of community instead of excessive ego that leads to profit maximization

The natural price is established by the Fourth Law of Value which says that there must be balance in any economy, whether it be a family, company, or nation. This mirrors the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics that has the concept of thermal equilibrium* leading to temperature.

This concept does not exist in Economics because profit maximization prevents it. This is why modern economic systems have recurring crashes as a result of the violation of this natural law of value. Pantrynomic systems are crash-resistant because they know that there exists a natural price and so the system is designed to stay near it. 

> *In Medical Superphysics, this manifest as the balance between things that affect our health to maintain an equilibrium as good health. In Supersociology, this is balance of giving value to all classes of society in order to maintain stability and prevent revolutions.


In our cake example, let us assume that Mr. Chef's labor at ordinary profits is $2 and his ingredients and inputs vary daily from $1 to $3, and he sold the cake at $4:

Day | Real Price (Cost)| Market Price (Selling Price)
--- | --- | ---
Monday | $5 | $4
Tuesday | $4 | $4
Wednesday | $4 | $4
Thursday | $3 | $4
Friday | $4 | $4

The Natural Price would be $4, representing the most frequent and low real price, assuming that profit maximization was not observed.

The natural price is the lowest..he is likely to sell them for any considerable time.. [It is]..the central price, to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating...

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
The market price..is regulated by the proportion between the quantity..actually brought to market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price.

In Pantrynomics, the balance between market and natural prices is checked through a grain index which compares the prices of commodities relative to the common grain eaten by the people. 

Even without a grain index, people will naturally feel the imbalance in the economy and start to protest if the increase in market prices no longer keep their ratio to the natural prices. Such an unnatural increase would occur if there were:

- excessive primary arbitrage as monopoly of production, or
- excessive secondary arbitrage as monopoly of distribution.  
<!-- distribution or retail of the produced goods and services were stifled by excessive secondary arbitrage.   -->

Modern Economics has no concept of natural price and so there are often wild fluctuations in prices in modern economic systems which allow maximum profits, but also losses.
 

## The Resulting Concepts from the Fourth Law

The resulting concepts from the Fourth Law of Value are:

- Natural Price
- Socio-economic Balance as Demand-Capital-Industry-Trade ratios
- The militant class (as a ruling government) to ensure this balance

## Putting it all together

We can now make a table for the four classifications of Exchangeable value in pantrynomics, using "price" as its snapshot:


Pantrynomics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable (Buyer's perspective) | Nominal Price (value in currency) | Market Price (value to the buyer)
Objective and Natural or Invariable (Seller's perspective) | Real Price (value in grain or labour) | Natural Price (value to the seller)


This is in contrast to Economics which has no concept of Real and Natural Price as it would prevent arbitrage, profit maximization, and consequently private sensory pleasures. It only has economic value (nominal price) and market value (market price):


Economics | Personal | Society
--- | --- | ---
Subjective and Variable | Nominal Price (value in currency) | Market Price (value to the buyer)



We can now summarize our laws:

Law | Price | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
1 | Nominal | Utilization - exposes the lack and the need
2 | Real | Specialization - increases quality and quantity to deal with the lack
3 | Market | Diffusion - addresses the lack
4 | Natural | Balance - prevents the crashes that leads to a recurrence of lack

  

In addition, we can see how the four laws of value are the reverse of the laws of thermodynamics. For example:
- the Zeroth law or the balancing of temperature is the first in Physics, but is the last in Pantrynomics as economic balance of the Fourth law
- the Third law, as absolute zero, is the last in Physics, but is the first in pantrynomics as its First law, as everything having a value.

This is because Physics believes that the universe began as an energetic Big Bang where energy began first, whereas humans start from birth or low-energy sleep where lack begins first

<!-- We then input these laws according to our eagle equation in order to create our 'equation' for demand and supply as ps:pd<sup>D</sup>. This overturns the mercantilist 'Law' of Supply and Demand of Economics which treats of s and d as equals:

![4](/images/graphics/eglwmg.png)
*Our eagle equation for all kinetic movementfits into both the Third Law of Thermodynamics and the Third Law of Value. The image above is for potental movement (I noticed that some physicists tend to be very fussy about the difference between potential and kinetic energy)*

We find that these four laws match the four factors of our [DCIT model](/posts-pantrynomics/the-demand-capital-industry-trade-model/) which is made up of:

| **Factor** | **Law of Value** | **Value** | **Model** | **Physics equivalent** | **Pantrynomic system** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demand | First | Natural Price | GPFY | Higgs Field | Basic Universal Revenue <br> as store of value <br> and the Grain Index | Basis of economic justice <br> which is lacking in both <br> Capitalism and Communism |
| Capital | Second | Real Price | GUE | Gravitation (we gravitate <br> towards certain interests <br> based on our dharma) | Effort Theory of Value <br> ISAIAH Match | Leads to economic democracy <br> and maximized non-commercial potential|
| Industry | Third | Nominal Price <br> (value in currency) | GGAMS | Strong Layer | Real Price via <br> the Economic Table | Economic balance or stasis <br> that is lacking in Capitalism |
| Trade | Fourth | Market Price <br> (value to the buyer) | GRID | Electroweak | Exchange systems with maintenance cost | Regulates merchants as <br> the opposite of Mercantilism |
 -->

Next we will explain Primary and Secondary Abitrage.
