<!-- This part links to Material Superphysics as the Four laws of Thermodynamics -->


Superphysics is the paradigm that sees reality as being made up of metaphysical waves that manifest as physical particles. 


## The 2 Domains

This leads to 2 domains of reality:

1. The Physical Domain

This domain has physical objects, sensations, and living beings. 

2. The Metaphysical Domain

This is domain has ideas, feelings, and abstract minds (as souls) that are the metaphysical counterparts of those physical objects, sensations, and living beings. 

The metaphysical domain is superior to the physical, but is more mysterious just as the physical is obvious. 


## The Loop from Idea to Experience

The goal of having ideas and feelings is for them to be experienced. Existence is thus made up of unending loops of idea and experience:
- An idea leads to action
- An action leads to an experience
- An experience leads to an idea 



Even then, the solution might still not reflect to our consciousness. 

The solution might finally reflect after we ask our customers directly, or read the device's user manual. At that moment, our minds feel a relief since its effort can end.

ALL men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses which are useful and loved for themselves. The most important is the sense of sight. We prefer seeing over the other senses.  
<cite>The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Chapter 1</cite>

The metaphysical domain exists inside our abstract minds and is infinitely larger and richer than physical domain of our senses. 

<!-- This matches the common opinion that the physical universe is much larger than what we can currently perceive. We can say that the unknown parts are part of the metaphysical domain until they are actually perceived physically.  -->

We call this domain "aethereal" or made of aether or *akasha* in Hinduism. This will be explained later when we explain our Five Layer Model. 


{{< quote ava="soc" >}}
If Person A were to go from the lower to the middle region, he would imagine that he is going up. Person B is in the middle region but has never seen the true upper world. He sees Person A coming and imagines that he has arrived in the upper region. 
<br><br>
If Person A goes back down again, Person B would imagine that he was descending. All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions.

These causes generate an inequality which is always maintained, and is continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements... The brightest part is called the aether. The most turbid sort is mist and darkness.

These 3 regions of metaphysical domain, physical domain, and current perception (as a merger of both) are expressed in our Superphysics icon.

{{< img src="/icons/sp100.png" size="is-48x48" alt="Superphysics icon">}}

- The blue upward triangle reprsents the metaphysical domain going upwards
- The green downward triangle represents the physical domain going 'down to earth'
- The yellow circle represents the focus of the mind as the here and now, as a combination of both. 

The balance of the triangles represents the balance between the abstract and the concrete. We can't focus on useless theory all the time. Nor can we go around doing physical actions without thinking of their causes and effects. 

Inaction leads to nothing. But haste, on the contrary, also makes waste. 

Human minds have limited abilities and so our focus must be relevant in order to maximize and concentrate what little we have. For example, as a species, it would be better to focus on solutions to global warming than to think of how to make more money, create a new cryptocurrency, or predict the stock market. The latter ideas are really based on selfish-interest instead of the common-interest.
