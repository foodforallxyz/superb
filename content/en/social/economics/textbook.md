We've started the long process of building a textbook, which actually is supposed to be a user's manual for the developers and operators of our proposed economic system called the [Pantry Points](https://pantrypoints.com).

After we discovered the four laws of value, it became irresistable how we could organize all of Pantrynomics elegantly under them. Every concept in economics, from econometrics, open market operations, supply and demand, taxation, etc, can be put under four huge headings! Those four headings can then be put under our [universal equation](/social/economics/principles/eagle) `E = Gl` 

Here is the suggested outline:

The Four Laws of Value | This part links to Material Superphysics <br> as the Four laws of Thermodynamics
