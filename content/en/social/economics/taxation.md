Adam Smith's maxims on taxation are found in Book 5 of the Wealth of Nations. Taxation is one of the two ways governments fund themselves, the other being government revenue from assets, like a fund that earns interest, or government land that earns rent. Because governments form a much smaller part of any society, the revenue from taxation is naturally higher. Here, we organize Smith's chapters on taxation for easier understanding.


Taxes that vary based on revenue: Article 1-3: Land, Rent, and revenue from land value or the produce of the land (Capital Gains and Inheritance taxes), Profit (revenue from stock and certain labour), and Income Taxes (revenue from labour)
Taxes that do not vary: Article 4: Capitation Taxes (Poll Taxes) and Sales Taxes (necessities vs luxuries)
Sales taxes were created to tax income via the people's expenses because:
It was hard to know each person's income
It was unfair to tax everyone an equal amount
"A tax on necessities operates the same way as a direct tax on wages."
Luxuries should be taxed.
The middle and upper classes, if they understand their own interest, should always oppose all taxes on necessities and direct taxes on the wages of labour. The final payment of such taxes all fall on themselves, with a big overcharge.
Taxes on necessities, such as energy, creates an easy form of revenue for governments and may be continued.
There are 2 ways to charge sales taxes:
By an annual payment for expensive, durable items
Instead of a big tax payment, the charge is spread over many years
By charging the seller just before the item is sold to the consumer (customs and excise duties)
High import duties create smuggling and fraud
High taxes give less revenue than small taxes
Sir Walpole suggested a taxation system for wine and tobacco similar to Smith's suggestions
Liquor taxes (taxing malt vs taxing beer)
Other Taxes that do not vary:
Tolls and fees
Taxes on luxuries

How we apply Smith's system

We implement Smith's forgotten system through our internet-based resource allocation (SORA) system by charging sales taxes directly on each party in a transaction and by categorizing all taxes as either income taxes or sales taxes. The income taxes are direct taxes which include all revenue from land, labor, and stock, while sales taxes are also direct taxes on items that circulate in the economy.




Income taxes - Property tax, Estate tax, Capital Gains tax, Income taxes, Profit taxes.




Sales taxes - Sales tax, VAT, Sin taxes, Customs and Excise Duties

In the current economic system, a 10% sales tax is passed on the buyer to be given and paid by the seller to the government. In our proposed system, taxes are divided equally between the parties in the trade. This makes the taxation on countertrade easier and more transparent. Here, the 10% taxes is divided into 5% and applied on both parties.
