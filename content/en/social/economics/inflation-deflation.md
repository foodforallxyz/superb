Our previous post on [The Four Laws of Value](/pantrynomics/four-laws-of-value) explained the metaphysics of value and why Pantrynomic's goal is zero inflation.

Economics shallowly defines 'inflation' as a rise in prices, and 'deflation' as its decline. This definition obviously does not hold because Japan has been in deflation for a long time and yet its prices, such as rent and consumer prices, remain high.

What really 'deflated' was economic activity, arising from Japan's declining population. Activity is based on the desire, will, or demand to act. This is why we define:
- inflation as <b>demand inflation</b>*
- deflation as <b>demand deflation</b>

> *From the viewpoint of Economics, the Pantrynomic definition is Demand-Pull Inflation. Cost-push inflation is merely demand-pull inflation from the viewpoint of the suppliers and producers. 


With this *pantrynomic* definition, we can derive the following concepts intuitively:

- **Zero inflation** means that the demand of society is satsified as quickly as possible so as to not have leftover unanswered demand. It also implies that the amount of money circulating is just enough to circulate the supply to the demand. If a society were one huge family, then it would be a family where all the children are fed and satisfied. 

- **Stagflation** is a situation where rich people can still demand even if production stagnates or even declines. The demand of the rich allows money to overcirculate. An analogy is a family wherein some children have much more than others, Real-world examples are:
  - the Stagflation of the 1970s
  - the third world debt which circulated among the cronies of corrupt dictators

- A **recession or depression** is a situation where even the rich cannot demand (or merely withholding their demand in the hopes of higher future profits). In this case, there is an undercirculation of money. This is similar to a family in poverty wherein the children go hungry

- **Hyperinflation** is a situation where production declines relative to demand. Unlike stagflation which is largely caused by the private sector, hyperinflation is caused by the government reacting to an earlier round of inflation. This prompts it to oversupply money. Anciently, this happened when a king debased his currency, causing it to overcirculate. An example is a family where the father demands all the resources. Modern examples are:
  - the Weimar republic
  - Zimbabwe under Mugabe
  - Venezuela under Maduro

- **Deflation** is a situation where demand declines nationwide. It would be like a family wherein some of the children moved out or died out. Examples are:
  - modern Japan
  - the Babylonian exile of the Jews
  - the Roman Plague of Justinian
  - Update Dec 2020: A recent example is the demand deflation during the first months of the pandemic

<!-- - **Wage-induced Inflation** is an increase in the demand of workers

- **Profit-induced Inflation** is an increase in the demand of business owners

- **Wage-induced Inflation** is an increase in the demand of workers
 -->
Under Classical Economics, any oversupply of money will cause a rise in demand which will then eat all the supplies, leading to a crash. <!-- be cancelled out by demand inflation which will then cannibalize productivity, leading to a crash. --> For example:
- a Roman emperor who debases his currency will cause inflation which will cause the citizens to support a usurper using the old currency
- A bank that oversupplies bank notes would create a bank run, allowing other banks to take its place in the economy. 

This natural competition between emperors and banks creates a reliable balance and predictable outcomes.


## The Natural Balance was Disrupted 

The Non-Classical Idea of Profit Maximization disrupted the natural balance advocated by Classical Economics. This is because junk ideas usually crop up when a society becomes rich. 



The industrial revolution allowed mass production which then allowed huge profits to be common. This then led to concept of profit maximization taught by the Marginal Revolution of the 1870's to preserve such profits. 

<!-- At the start of the industrial revolution, the whole world was lacking in steam engines, machines, steamboats, railroads, etc. This allowed the great profits to be realized by the producers of such items. With the great profits came the idea of profit maximization which was taught  in order to justify the phenomenon and supply more of such things.

> *We define [profits as revenue from lack](/articles/pantrynomics/defining-rent-wages-profit) -->

The bad effect of teaching profit maximization is that everyone from the 20th century **became programmed and brainwashed to go after high profits**. They were no longer happy with low profits at higher frequency, which was advocated by Classical Economics:

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
<p>A country fully stocked in all the trades possible would have great competition everywhere. It would reduce ordinary profits to the minimum.</p>
<cite>Wealth of Nations Book 1, Chapter 5</cite>
{{< /quote >}}

This obsession with high profits stopped investors from investing in low-profit ventures, causing them to crowd into  high-profit ones which became more and more speculative. This starves most of the economy of its lifeblood while oversupplies a few parts. 

This imbalance causes a crash and then a recession which represents the starvation of value.  

<!-- The problem is that a rich county will naturally have lower profits, **representing its low levels of lack**. Profit maximization at a low-profit environment makes capital-owners **withhold money** in expectation of higher profits. The problem is that higher profits were only possible in the past (when the country was not yet rich).  -->

<!-- Thus, **profit maximization at a low-profit environment** starves the rich economy of its lifeblood, causing a recession. It leads to a Depression if the profit maximization doctrine is so strong as to overcome the natural reaction to buy sale items at 50% off, and to hire people desperate for jobs. -->

Under Classical Economics, low prices during a recession would prompt both businesses and consumers to invest and spend to reviatalize the economy again. However, in a neo-classical profit-maximizing economy, the people still do not invest nor spend, since they have been programmed to go for high returns only. This prolongs the starvation of value, causing a depression. 

<!--  more, since not many people have been brainwashed to demand high profits. This would then soon increase economic activity back to normal.  -->

If profit maximization is bad for society, then why is it promoted and even imposed by Economics on the people? If a 2% inflation represents 2% unanswered demands in society, why is it set as a target by economists?


## Keynes is to Blame

During the Great Depression of the US, the economist John Maynard Keynes had a golden chance to denounce profit maximization by letting governments nationalize some banks and factories in order to compete with profit-maximizing businesses.  

However, he did the opposite. He proposed that the government feed the speculative 'animal spirits' even more by increasing money supply through "open market operations":

{{< quote ava="keynes" >}}
The aggregate demand for money to satisfy the speculative-motive continually responds to changes in the rate of interest, as a curve. These changes are in the changing prices of bonds and debts of various maturities. This is why “open market operations” are done.
{{< /quote >}}

Instead of getting rid of profit maximization which is the heart of the problem, <b>Keynes actually established it through the liquidity preference as the love of money*!</b>


> *Update Oct 2021: The proper and opposite policy is to stifle speculation and excessive growth as what China has done by letting Evergrande collapse and by limiting Alibaba and other Chinese tech giants. This would restore economic balance. These are opposite of what the US did in bailing out Wall Street.


This would've made Adam Smith turn in his grave. In a single book, *[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](/research/keynes/general-theory)*, Keynes wrote down the principles that lead to quantitative easing, interest rates, government spending, and huge debts. All of these policies are mercantile and are the opposite to what Adam Smith advocated.

Keynes advocated to increase the money circulating until prices start increasing, a state which he calls **true inflation**.

{{< quote ava="keynes" >}}
When a further increase in effective demand produces no further increase in output and entirely spends itself on an increase in the cost-unit fully proportionate to the increase in effective demand, we have reached a condition which might be appropriately designated as one of true inflation.
<cite>General Theory, Chapter 21</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


## Inflation is Free Work

The problem with this is that inflation* is worse for the worker than the business owner. This is because the owner can raise his prices at will, as "an increase in the cost-unit fully proportionate to the increase in effective demand." 

The worker, on the other hand, cannot ask for a proportional raise from his boss. As a result, inflation slowly eats up the the worker's wages, giving the effect of him **working for free**.

> *Remember, we defined inflation as demand inflation


For example, if last month I worked for 100 hours at $1 per hour, then at that month, I would be able to buy $100 worth of goods. 
- But if this month, prices rise by 2%, then my $100 will be able to buy only $98 worth of goods based on last month's prices. **Inflation would have made me work 2 hours for free without me knowing it!** 
- If the company has 50 workers, then it gets 100 hours of free work or $100 savings which it can use to hire one new worker if the wages of the 50 were not increased.


{{< quote ava="keynes" >}}
<p>Every trade union will resist a cut in money-wages. <i>But no trade union would go on strike for every rise in the cost of living.</i> They thus do not create an obstacle to any increase in aggregate employment which is attributed to them by the classical school.</p>
<cite>Chapter 2, General Theory</cite>
{{< /quote >}}


Thus, inflation-driven employment really does increase employment **quantity**, but reduces employment **quality**. It does not strike at the root cause of the problem which is the profit maximization doctrine of capital-owners and investors. 

Rather than break up big capital and force competition and innovation among businesses, Modern Economics rather protects big capital and even feeds its love for money through:
- monetary easing
- government projects wherein public taxes are given to private companies* to create roads, dams, and, more recently, green energy. 

> *China solves this with state-owned companies






Worse is that Keynes wasn't really sure if his theory could lead to stable money supply and prices:

{{< quote ava="keynes" >}}
<p>Mdp/pdM = ep.ed.. this last expression gives us the proportionate change in prices in response to a change in the quantity of money, it can be regarded as a generalised statement of the Quantity Theory of Money. <i>I do not myself attach much value to manipulations of this kind; and I would repeat my warning that they involve just as much tacit assumption as to what variables are taken as independent</i>.. the best purpose served by writing them is to exhibit the extreme complexity of the relationship between prices and the quantity of money</p>
{{< /quote >}}


This is why economists sometimes advocate for 0%, 2%, or 4% inflation -- **because the whole theory was uncertain to begin with!** 

<!-- The cause of Keynes' uncertainty is the fact that, to pantrynomics, money-price is a 'particle-effect' that represents 'value-feelings' which are really causal-waves that change constantly.  -->

Basing an economy on money or interest rates is to base the economy on an ever-changing effect instead of a known cause. This makes it naturally unstable, with solutions always lagging behind the problem, or even causing future problems. Nominal minimum wages might be adjusted to keep up with nominal price inflation, but real wages really lag behind as time passes, as seen in the productivity-wage gap.

### Inflation-Driven Growth

<!-- Out of the Fire and Into the Frying Pan -->

To Keynesian economists, the love for money is the key driver of the economy. This is why they advocate the government to jumpstart sagging economies by driving interest rates down to add new money. This is then thought to push investment up which will increase effective demand, manifesting as inflation. This will then increase employment until true inflation is reached. 

But as we have seen, this merely by gets the economy going by making wage-earners* work for free. 

> *In the business model of the Roman empire, it would be like the emperor advertising the barren lands of the Middle East and Saharan Africa as profitable to conquer in order to create employment for his legions. This would then force their legions to work doubly hard to conquer those territories which produce so little value, leading those legions towards mutiny, being 'woke' and then starting a 'cancel culture' against the Emperor.


Thus, Keynesian economics solves recessions by making workers work for free bit by bit. Sooner or later, the low real-wages then become unbearable and become slave wages or what Keynes calls 'marginal disutility of employment'. 

At such a point, the worker gives too much free work and stops working by holding mutinous strikes and protests, which became so common in the 1970's and 80's. It also paralyzes governments which become mired in debt, and is seen in government shutdowns in the US and the increase in corporate lobbying which funds the pauper congressmen.

To prevent such high inflation, the sweet-spot became 2% -- higher than the 0% that was advocated in the 1970s and what pantrynomics actually advocates, but lower than the 4+% that would bring instability. The focus on stability then became the job of central banks*. 


Thus, while economists focus on **growth** to generate employment, central banks focus on **price stability** to keep that employment. 

> *Under Classical Economics, the competition among investors and entrepreneurs would naturally create stability. They would not need the Central Banks to dictate interest rates since each bank would have their own precious metals. Central bank interest rates would only be useful to lenders to the government, and would be near the average interest rates set by private banks.


In the paradigm of Classical Economics, this is similar to a situation where the king is deposed by businessmen (Mercantilists) who then instruct the king's advisers and bankers to impose mercantile policies on all. This would then create a modern economic feudalism with big capital as the feudal lords and employees as peasants.


The results of all this Keynesian monetary easing or pumping of money are:
- widespread inequality from the increase of low-quality jobs now known as [bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs)
- huge government debts
  - This passes the current problems (usually of the baby boomers who are the current policy-makers) to future generations* who are incapable of knowing of the burdens** dumped on them by fancy-worded policies such as 'quantitative easing' and 'stimulus packages'. 

> *This manifests as millennials losing all hope of getting a decent job that would pay for a house, or getting quality education that does not involve a huge debt.


> **Some economists try to solve this top-down approach with a bottom-up solution as universal basic income (UBI). However, this is actually worse since it does not guarantee the generation of employment. The cancellation of UBI trials in many countries prove that it is more useless. In Classical-speak, this is like the king paying off barbarians and peasants so that they will not revolt or commit crimes.


Japan was the first country to implement aggressive quantitative easing and is also the country to realize its bad effects. Its Lost Generation represents the youth that grew up after the collapse of Japan's asset-price bubble in the early '90s and exactly matches the effects of the paragraph above. Japan is among the countries with the highest debts in the world.

> Update Jan 2021: The failure of Abenomics and the 2020 Olympics, along with the resignation of Abe and the rise of Japanese taxes prove the failure of Keynesian policies

{{< quote ava="smith" >}}
Such improvident anticipations gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding. This practice puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period to an indefinite period, never likely to come. However, it raises more money than the old practice of anticipation. When men became familiar with funding, it became universally preferred<!--  to anticipation during great state exigencies. Relieving the present exigency is always the object of government. The future liberation of the public revenue they leave to the care of posterity. -->

<!-- ### Mercantilism is Alive and Kicking in Macroeconomics Too

According to Smith, Mercantilism was the origin of the [Supply Curve of Microeconomics](/pantrynomics/market-equilibrium-fallacy). Here we see that it has also made its way into macroeconomics by keeping the love of money intact. To feed this love, it cannibalizes value from the general public and the government. 

This gives incentives to businesses to meet their profit maximization demands. Instead of getting paltry but natural 5-10% returns, they can generate unnatural 40-500%* ROI (return on investments) through low interest rates, tax incentives, tax avoidance, and fewer regulations.

> *As a startup founder I have seen venture capitalists aim for 5x return even at a secular stagnation environment


These policies culminate in inflation which would then indicate an increase the quantity of employment. However, economists do not reveal that this also reduces the quality of employment and transfers the burden to future generations who will enter a world with high prices in rents, education, and utilities and only bullshit jobs and global warming disasters, very different from the opportunity-filled world that their baby boomer grandparents entered. -->

If money is not the solution, then what is? The next post will explain [economic social contracts](/articles/pantrynomics/why-business-is-immoral) as the alternative to money and svadharma as a replacement to liquidity preference.

Economists see nothing wrong with inflation, as proven in this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2021/05/12/four-reasons-to-stop-panicking-over-inflation) This is because of the shallow reasoning that the high prices go back to the economy anyway. We answer, yes it goes back, but more to the profit-earners and less to the wage-earners.
