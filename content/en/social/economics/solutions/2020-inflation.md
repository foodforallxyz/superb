Inflation surged in the second half of 2021 as the effect from the Covid which began in Q1 of 2020. 

Covid forced the world to go on lockdown. Without a normal economy going, people started buying cryptocurrencies and NFTs with their savings (retail money). This caused a surge in the crypto prices. The money that was supposed to go to circulate the real economy was funneled into a virtual casino that inflated crypto prices without producing any real utility.

This is similar to [quantitative easing money](/social/economics/why-qe-failed) (wholesale money) being used to inflate stock prices. 

With both wholesale and retail money going into non-production, output falls, causing inflation. 


## The Solution: Ban Crypto

To bring back money into productive uses, crypto mining and transactions must be banned in countries experiencing inflation.
